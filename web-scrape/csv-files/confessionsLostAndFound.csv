Year 1 student here. Upon working-seniors' convincing, im deciding to change major away from pharmacy but my interest lies in pharmaceutical industry manufacturing. The existing bsc pharm curriculum doesnt seem to fit the need despite the specialization. Can seniors please advice which track in chemistry or engin should i take and if modules address the needs of industry?

1,"To OP #74590, I can totally understand how you feel. In my situation, is not exactly the same as yours. 
I, however, broke up with my partner of 3 years over several months ago. I understand that I initiated it, and I dated a few people afterwards. I've met people who used me, played me, and being overly desperate beings (too nice to me),  yet still feel like I couldn't find anyone better than my ex. But I didn't wanna patch back because I felt like we were toxic and I became the worst version of me. 

We both had quite a bad temper and low tolerance in general. Whenever one flared, we would ended up quarreling. I don't see myself growing to be a better person in terms of patience. And I really want a patient person who will not flare up over minor things, and will influence me to be more patient as well.  

However, it made me more wary of love, such that I would want to be more understanding towards my next partner, address whatever issues we have as a mature adult, and help each other grow into the best version of ourselves.

2,"It is awful of me to decide to play the person who played me? He asked me out and agreed to fetch me the next day, and then on that day itself he completely ignored my question when I asked him was the plan still on because he sort of messed up by oversleeping etc. 
Instead of cutting him out, I just felt like doing the same back to him. I know it's awful and unhealthy to live this way, but is it normal to feel so angry getting played? I know it probably won't hurt him if I do back the same but I just want him to feel played at some point too.

On the one hand, I'm grateful that I'm still at second upper. On the other hand, 4.0 is very shaky as it could just drop to second lower easily. My CAP has been stuck at 4.0 for 3 semesters and I'm tired of worrying every semester whether it will drop below 4.

4,"Hi, so I was dating this guy recently, and I felt like the reason he tried to keep me around is to use me for sex.. 
Even though he denies it, I realised that he doesn’t make any effort to meet me properly. Whenever he asked to meet me, it’s either work related or a place to chill. I actually gave up on this date already. 
However, recently I think he invited me to a family event the next day while he was kinda drunk? Wasn’t sure if he was drunk as he was still capable of walking and eating but he sounded drunk when he called me. 
I didn’t really believed his sincerity in the invitation as that was so unlike of him.
Next day, he kinda airplane-d me. When asked him about the event, he just ignored me and told me he reached his family event late etc. 

Anyone ever gotten this kind of shit from guys before? I feel like most of the guys I met are jerks lmao.

7,"To my junior in uni,

I feel like i have to get this off my chest because the guilt has been killing me every day that i avoid it. It's not that i forgot to contact you, but i dont think i have the face to do so, even more, after finding out that you're in the same course.

I would like to apologize for the misdirection given to you years ago because back then, i was in uni and i really had rose-tainted glasses on, sharing with you how great being a pharmacist was without knowing fully. One could say i was optimistic, i wanted to be at the front line, studying hard so that i could be the best pharmacist for my patients. But I too was not fully aware of whats to come back then.  

Fast forward to now when me and my peers' bonds are ending... i really cant say the same. Day-2-day, yes i do counsel patients, do medication reconciliation, even run some clinics and help patients with their medications and pre-meds. There are good days, then for the a majority 90%... not so. it all feels empty, it feels like routine with no growth. It feels like what i do is not valued, not respected. With my peers, I feel happy but in the wards, it's like I am transparent to all. What I hoped to bring about for my patients, was slowly never to become a possibility. What i learnt and studied was rarely utilized, and sometimes sadly forgotten, and I have recognized this as early as my pre-registration days. With others leaving in high numbers over the past years, leaving us few behind to continue their workload is also tiring. Now it is my turn too, but i also cant see how my skills here can be useful outside and wonder if it is too late to start anew as well. I am afraid but I myself also want to find joy again.

I really wish i shut my mouth back then, or knew more to provide you with a more balanced view. I really hope it isnt too late for you like what has been for me. 

I have so much more to say, but
Humbly seeking forgiveness, and wanting to sleep in some peace,  V

9,"Not an NUS student, but I'm looking for one.

About a year ago, an NUS girl struck up a conversation with me (also a girl) on a Circle Line train towards Kent Ridge thinking I was a fellow student. As we talked, she mentioned that she was an aspiring teacher and enjoyed asking her students philosophical questions like ""What is the meaning of life?"" (which is, honestly, a little weird, but I'm also weird so I'm intrigued).

Unfortunately I didn't get to ask for her contact info before I alighted at one-north, and I don't know anything else about her. I've been looking out for her on the train ever since but I guess our timings just never coincided again.

I'm not really expecting to be able to find her by posting this, but it'd be really cool if I did. If anything, I'm just curious about how she's doing. If you're out there, I hope you're doing well!

11,"I'm the OP of #72600 . I wanna thank you guys for the advice, feedback and comments. It really means something. Most of you guys mentioned that texting might be the issue, but that's not what I feel? If he wants his space, I would totally respect that, and I'm not one to double text often. I honestly feel like we don't text so much to the extent that he would need his space? He doesn't work much, so most of his time spent were mostly at home, family, and friends. 
So here's an update about what's going on. Feel free to skip if you are too lazy to read! 

He doesn't really enjoys talking about our personal stuff, and he claimed that he is lazy and said he would eventually tell me slowly and surely. He wants to take it slow and see how things goes instead of establishing any title or be in a committed relationship. I pestered him quite a bit to get him to talk about what's going on. He finally told me he isn't ready for a committed relationship, saying that he doesn't like the quarrels and argument that comes with it. I totally understand it and we have never quarreled before, as I don't like to find fault or confront a person directly unless I really need to. 

Also, I feel like he would not be emotionally available for me. That is fine to me as of now, I don't see it as a big issue as I also feel lazy to share about my personal life unless he asked. I just kept assuring him that its ok to be honest with me if I'm just an fwb, or if he isn't serious with me. I told him that I would rather he be 100% honest with me than to toy with my feelings or led me on. However, he kept reassuring me to trust him, that he isn't toying with me. He claims that he just wanted someone by his side. 

Whenever I tried to make plans with him, he seemed uninterested in carrying out and would come up with excuses. The only time he asked me out, was mostly to stayover. He told me he just enjoy chilling at home with me and watch shows, and that he feel that not having sex is fine. However, it still seems shady right? So now, am i safe to say that it's pretty obvious I probably meant nothing to him, and that he might really be toying with my feelings, and just treated me as an fwb? Or should I just trust him?

14,"Honestly as a bilingual Chinese Australian girl who is born in Shanghai and moved to Sydney when I was 13, I'm sick to the death of the divide between Singaporeans and Chinese international students. I came to NUS after finishing my high school in Sydney because why not since some of my relatives from China stay here for background information.

Why on earth does this have to happen? Because of certain norms held that you find unpleasant? Well let me tell you a story, I was bullied in my first year of high school for the exact reasons you guys hate them for. I was mocked for my poor English, the way I dressed, the mannerisms I carried over, I was so lonely and I could only hang out with other Chinese born students in my English as a second language class. I was bullied by Asian Australians who wanted nothing to do with me because they were afraid that someone like me undermined their social standing in Australia. I eventually adapted because in my ESL class, all international students of all backgrounds in my school suddenly started to make friends with each other based on our personalities and who we are as a person, not because of our cultural backgrounds. That way I could finally embrace Australian culture and learn to build bridges between international students in my high school and locals, and realise 'integration' cannot be forced.

Now coming into NUS, I see this very same divide and it reminds me of my high school days. I feel a sense of urgency to bridge this divide as a bicultural individual (well tbh I still find myself more Chinese than Australian because I still dress like someone from Mainland and my traditional values but still pretty Australian in my thought process). Please be understanding of this Chinese international students, they are already in so much financial burden and struggling. We honestly need a dialogue to find a comprimise to bridge this bitter divide.

15,"Hellu, another NUS Architecture student here, come to share my opinions on this tsunami of a lifestyle we get swept up in. I don’t claim to speak for other Architecture students’ lives and thoughts on this, but I hope my two cents here goes a long way.
On my way home today, I saw an old man. He stood next to a swing for a long while, then sat on it and swung, having the time of his life. I thought to myself, “When was the last time I felt carefree enough to do that?”
As Archi students, our lives and minds are consumed by the work that we do, the never-ending “Project”. Even as I write this, I’m thinking, “How much time is this taking away from my design work?” We push aside issues that most would consider critical to functioning in human society, like politics, socialization, spirituality, and mental well-being just so that we can produce the best spaces for others to live their best lives in. Ironic, isn’t it, that the people who design for other people barely even live like people anymore. 
Some who read this may think, “Oh, these people are just complaining because they lack the rigor to succeed in this profession.” But I think deep down, even the most successful of architects have paid a deep price in their lives to be able to create for the human race. This doesn’t get better when we say to people,” Aki siong ah, wa die lah!”, “Aiya, Aki no life one la!” When we do this, we are trivializing the pains that we go through, turning it into a reputation and a twisted badge of honor to have “survived” Architecture, and people might just assume, after encountering this vicious self-denial we should be able to take this kind of pain forever.
Architects really do put a lot of thought into everything that they create, making damn sure that the people who use the spaces they create enjoy and benefit in ways they might not even realize. For all the non-Architecture students who see this post, the next time you walk into a building that you like going to, try to notice and think about what the architect might have done to make your life within comfortable, your experience enjoyable, and make you come back time after time, just because you “like the place”. For all the Archi students who happen to look up from your models and butter papers to see this, take a little break. Go for a run. Talk to a friend. Go have dinner. Write a weird rant essay like me. Remember to live. Remember you’re a person too.

21,"At the tender age of 8, I was molested by a relative. It didn’t go further than that because he was thwarted by someone returning home. I escaped to safety.

But I no longer felt safe.

I was consumed by shame, insecurity and fear. I didn’t dare tell anyone about the incident, because I felt like I had asked for it. I’d asked for it by being in the exact spot at that exact time. I’d asked for it by freezing up and not retaliating. I felt like I was complicit ー that I’d allowed myself to be violated. I was afraid that if I reported him, I’d ruin my family. I was afraid that I’d be accused of lying. I was afraid that, somehow, someone would be able to tell that this had happened to me, and they’d know how dirty and broken I was was.

And so I survived the only way I knew how, alone, lonely. I suppressed my emotions and the incident. I breathed no word of it. I escaped through reading. However, from time to time, it’d come back to haunt me. I would be consumed by feelings of fear, unworthiness, shame, guilt and brokenness. I developed many negative coping mechanisms due to my fear of abandonment and need to control everything. These mechanisms developed as I felt helpless from the incident, and was determined not to be rendered that way any longer. These mechanisms resulted in toxic behaviours.

I spent my teenage years people-pleasing, pretending that I was introverted and hence didn’t like socialising. In fact, I was desperate for love and validation. I was always the cheerful one, the dramatic and animated one, the funny one. Even when I was crying and depressed inside, I had on my mask. I was always described as “vivacious” and “bubbly”. I didn’t allow people to get to know the real me, for fear they’d discover how broken and unworthy of love I was. And so, I skipped gatherings and social events. In my way, I rejected others before I could be rejected. 

Many times, I thought of ending my own life. But I never did. Why? When I was 14, I met some very special people. These people showed me that they were willing to love me, warts and all. I finally found people I could speak my truth to. Instead of the judgement I expected, I was received with love and compassion. I was heard and seen, not as a victim, but as a survivor.

20 years have gone past. This year, I finally gained the courage to come out to my parent about the incident. I chose to speak up, as I knew that I wanted to begin my healing process. I no longer wanted to just be a survivor, I wanted to be healed. I was met, not with judgement, but with love and compassion.

I’ve begun seeing a therapist and also journalling to process my trauma. There are good days, and there are bad days. Some days I get triggered so badly and anxiety attacks hit me hard. Thankfully, there are more good days than bad days, of late.

I wrote this entire post, feeling peaceful and anxiety-free.

Thanks for coming to my TEDtalk and allowing me to reclaim my narrative.

I hope my story shows people who have shared my struggles that all of you are seen and heard. I hope my story becomes a page in your survival guide. I hope my story brings you hope today ー that you can still build a beautiful life after trauma, that there are still wonderful humans who will hold space for ALL OF YOU, no matter how broken you might perceive yourself, and that it’s never too late to heal.

Above all, I hope my story inspires you to be a little bit more empathetic and compassionate today. Some wounds are invisible, but that doesn’t make them any less real.

22,"Me and my (ex-?)boyfriend we have been together for 3 years. We loved each other a lot, and even have plans for our future, getting BTO etc. However, things turned for the worst ever since we hit the 1 year mark, where we started to see compaitability issues, different outlook in life. But we tried our best to resolve them, or rather we would just leave it to be. He would often MIA when we start talking about this problem, coming out with excuses to avoid these serious talks. And leave me hanging or upset for the rest of the night.

He went for his exchange earlier this year and mine started on the later half of the year. We had no chance to meet at all as it overlaps, and hence it increased the frequency of our arguments. It surrounded mainly on how I am not prioritising him when he is the one who had no time for me (we only facetime once a month or not at all). He started thinking about a future that is according to his goals, his interest, and not me. What is the most important is, he never provided me the emotional support and I find myself going to someone else instead when in difficult situations. We have very different values. He often say he love me, but never actually act like he do.

So I decided that we had to take a break, that perhaps we will both reflect and be more accepting of our differences, since after all we really do love each other a lot. I brought that up and since then, it was the last time we talked, there was no closure, nothing.

But rather than trying to find a way to solve this, he immediately started using all the dating apps, hooking up with girls and going out on dates searching for a new partner. This isn't considered cheating but to be honest, it didn't feel really good. I took the time to heal and hoping we can get back together or find a way out of this, but all he did was give up on the relationship.

I see her being depressed living with the guilt of denying a life as she always yearn for a child, the guy never did followed up with her wellbeing or even offered to cough out the abortion fees, even told her good that she aborted as the baby may not be carried through the full term since his previous baby with his ex wife did not make it as well, she went through the entire process alone and I only got to know the ordeal she had went through after she broke down one night and confided in me. 

I am just utterly disgusted how can a guy be this irresponsible yet still having the time of his life but am more concern how can I be of any help to a friend who is in need now?

So back to the question: what exactly am I missing out on? I dont ask this cos I’m considering it but because I want to get a quantifier, like what do I sacrifice when I choose not to open the door to that kind of lifestyle.
Any kinds of answers welcome, whether you do or don’t drink (:

47,"Hello! I am not from NUS, but today (Sat) while traveling in Prague with my gf, we met a NUS 2nd Year (going 3rd year) Geography student. She is currently on NOC in Stockholm, Sweden and we met during a free walking tour. Well... it started pouring half way during the tour and since she didn’t have an umbrella, we offered her one of ours and I used my poncho instead. But here comes the thing... She kinda disappeared from the tour group (along with our umbrella) and was nowhere to be found. (she could have lost the way while we walk from point to point.) By the time we found out she wasn’t around, it was too late.
The chances of us getting back our umbrella is pretty slim, given that she is heading to Poland tmr, and back to Sweden on Monday. We will also be leaving Prague on Monday...
But just hoping that if someone happen to know her, can you direct her to us? We will hope to at least hear from her. Thank you.

50,"I’m a Singaporean, always will be. But I have grown up half of my life in Melbourne. Currently I am studying in Monash but have reached out to Singaporean international students society to keep in touch with my roots more.

My story is one that’s is unique, I lived and settled in Box Hill (the largest Chinese Australian community in Melbourne), as a result I had very little angmoh friends and most of my friends are either ABCs or Singaporean students.

I am so saddened to see how many Singaporeans are ashamed of their identity so much that they will fake accents once they go back to Singapore for a holiday, not most Singaporeans overseas but a lot. Why? Life is so tough back home? I get it. But I don’t have it easier as I went to a selective school here, added the fact that I deal with everyday burdens of getting good grades and the pressure to assimilate (to find the best of both worlds). Try to have some contentment with your Singaporean identity, a few of my ABC friends tell me they want to move to Singapore because it meets their needs of balancing Asian and Western culture together.

But that said I do find myself in a dilemma where I am confused and conflicted about my cultural identity. Singaporeans find me too ‘angmoh’, angmohs find me too ‘Asian’ while ABCs see me as ‘Nick Young’... like what lmao. I do find myself being able to connect with both Singaporeans and ABCs but I feel like I can’t truly fit into either groups. So who am I? Which group do I belong to?

Hello, I have lost a 1-liter water bottle, blue color, have NUS logo on it today Sun 05/05/2019 around lunch time at UTown Fine Food (The first canteen from UTown bus stop). 

I used the bottle to chop a table near the Indian food stall where a group of 4 students (2 girls, one of the girls was wearing a white T-shirt, the other girl was wearing a floral brown shirt and a white short if I'm not wrong & 2 guys) was about to leave. I got ask one of the girls whether they were abt to leave. The girl said yes so I put my water bottle there & go queue at the stall nearby. When I looked back a while later, they have gone together with my water bottle. I have desperately run around for an hour & tried to find for it but it seems to be hopeless.

If anyone accidentally took it, please return to me (you could like or comment this post & I'll pm you). The bottle is very meaningful to me & I really like it. I'll compensate you for that. Thanks a lot in advance!

Your eyes were bloodshot red and your clothes were unkempt. We took the train at Haw Par Villa towards Dhoby Ghaut and sat across each other. Then, I started noticing that you were crying - your tears were rolling down your cheeks onto your shirt. You tried to keep it in but your weeping was audible. I wanted to pass you a pack of a tissue, but by then, there were a lot of people between us and I didn’t want you to feel like you were making a scene. You kept controlling your tears throughout the ride, occasionally looking up from your phone. When I was going to pass you the tissue, you were already standing up and alighting at Bishan.

If you’re reading this, I’m not sure what you’re going through, and I’m not going to say I know how you feel - but I just wanted to let you know that it’ll be okay. Everything will be okay. Please take care of yourself. :) if you need to talk to someone, please seek help. Have a good weekend ahead!

So what I really want to talk about is about humanity. You are right that he deserves a harsher punishment, you are right that he should be condemned by us all, but in a world where we are so caught up with being right, sometimes we might have forgotten to be kind. It will not pain me to see him getting his deserved punishment, and this is not about him or them but about us as a community. It really makes me very heartbroken to see us becoming so merciless. 

I know everyone feels the injustice and that’s good, but I feel that only when we are put into a difficult position like this, in a position of strength to determine someone’s fate, then it truly becomes a test of character. 

I really hope that in general, disregarding this incident, we can become a kinder society.

So for a few days, i went to the office regularly to check the lost and found. This card has my name on it so it is easier to find than other normal  ez link cards. After a week, i remembered that i had registered my card in the ez link mobile app. When I went to check the past transactions, i realised someone had been using my card to travel around instead of returning it to the lost and found. 

It is unbelievable that auniversity student are doing this. The amount i lost was not much (less than $5). What was more disappointing was the lack of honesty by the person who took the card. 

So, if you are reading this, i will just let you know that you will have to face the guilt of having travelled around using someone else's money regardless of how much you used from the card.

To the rest, if you see someone else's property, remember to return it to lost and found.

Here's the sad part. Of the 2 - 3 hours she was in the lounge, she chose to leave during the same 10 minutes I went down to get food. Imagine the disappointment when I came up and realised she left already.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/first-fully-designed-and-built-in-singapore-bus-launched

If you'd remember, I did say something about ""Hey, please look out for the bus I'm gonna build, it'll be on the news!!"", like, 2 years ago, but it... was a no show.

Out of curiosity, I recently googled your name (yeah, creepy, I know, but I really was curious on how you're doing), and well, you're doing well in LTA... As expected (Uh. ""Stanford"", if not enough clues to who you are). 

Since then, I've resigned. Perhaps, getting your first choice in life is not as sweet as it seems. A first choice, perhaps, is either a choice out of practicality, or an over- glorified piece of white bread. Nevertheless, it is the interest to tinker, and play with things, that will drive me to carry on with that over-glorified white bread. I mean, f you're bored, you just need to spread kaya, or put meat on it, right?

I suppose, that I am writing this, to a person whom it will never reach, to that person who doesn't remember who I am anymore, as a form of closure bah. I am writing this, because I need to let go, to become more mature, to make space for compensate for the lost time I spent pining for the many others who never once looked back no matter how much I wished and prayed, to grow.

I realise now, that even if I meet you today, at this time, you won't be able to recognise me. I will not know what to say to you any more.

Hahas, but either way, ehh, 欠扁 girl, the world is big, I don't suppose I'd need to tell a person who travels more than me, but as my family always says, 有缘再相见. If fate allows it, may we meet again.

I still don't understand why data science is now a thing in Business School. I mean, from the nature of the subject and if people wanted it, shouldn't this be in Computing school instead?

On the bright side (if I pass, I hope), I'll be able to get a more well-rounded experience from this. Just take GER1000 in the same way. It's better to know some aspects from the technical side instead of sticking to what you're comfortable learning.

127,"Barely a week into the term, CS2040 and CS2040C have created quite a stir amongst students. 

Dijkstra reports.

Aikenot Dueet, a distraught 2040 student whom we found crying in a cubicle, told us how sorting has effectively screwed his life. ""At first, they sorted us by marks and assigned us letters based on a curve, and now, they are teaching us sorting while sorting us at the same time,"" weeped Aikenot.

We understand that students of this much dreaded course learn interestingly named sorting algorithms in the first few weeks, such as bubblesort, mergesort and quicksort. 

Despite being the humble algorithm it is, bubblesort embodies many of society's values. When a number is greater than the number on its immediate right, swapping happens. In layman terms, when one goes up, another has to go down. We'll discuss the socio-political significance of other algorithms in future reports.

Another student, Aino Laif, had a much more positive impression of 2040. He said, ""When finals ended, I felt as if my life no longer had any purpose. I was depressed by the lack of work and torture and even contemplated suicide. But thankfully, my depressing workless holiday was cut short by two weeks when my professor sent us an email asking us to do C++ problems or get sorted. That was the best new year of my life.""

Students of the school of Java have it much worse than their C++ counterparts as they are constantly reminded of the fact that their lives are public, static and void. Disciples of Source and survivors of 1101S were mortified to find mutation in almost every line of code they wrote. The uninformed had a nasty shock when they realised Java and JavaScript were two very different things.

A resigned student, Aikenever Dueet, told us, ""I joined CS with the hope of changing the world. Now, I guess I'll just be flipping pancakes for the rest of my living days.""

The aforementioned student wasn't enthused when we pointed out a sorting algorithm named after his potential career.

Meanwhile, our investigative journalists are busy finding connections, if any, between the 2040 instructors, the head of the state and the fountain of wealth. We hope to get back to you soon.

I just went on a date with some girl from Singapore and she puts a rather unnatural British accent and couldn’t stop rambling about how much she hates Asians and to be fair as a CBC who is very much in touch with his Chinese roots (high GPA lyfe, Hong Kong breaks on the summer, watches Cdramas on occasion and speak Chinese on an intermediate basis) I found this attitude rather distasteful, I came to Singapore to explore a place where it can suit my needs of wanting a place that balances Asian culture with Western culture and to be fair I love Singapore but how often do you guys come across these girls? I find this girl very cringeworthy that no decent Asian guy would go for anyway

How do canteen vendors on our campus make money during the vacation term? 

I notice most canteens still have to remain open during vacation period (since they still have to serve people working in the school) but the crowd is certainly much, much less compared to during the school term, when the canteens would have thousands of students to cater to everyday. 

It's kinda sad when I come to school during vacation and see the canteen so empty. Sellers will be lazing about when there's hardly anyone to cater to.

Wouldn't this have them incur immense losses? These canteen vendors could work elsewhere and probably get better revenue during this vacation period. 
Or does NUS compensate them or something? Anyone has any idea?

I am born as a boy, i.e. to say i am a male biologically. However, i feel a bit feminine and more comfortable seeing myself as a girl even though i do not have much female interactions, coming from a boys school for 10 years and being in mechanical engineering in NUS. The reason I am asking is because right now I am in BKK and I decided and have already done a sex change operation. I am not due to return until a week later, so I need your advice on how do i break this news to my family and friends on my recent developments. I admit it is a rash decision as I did not consult anybody about it. But yet i feel good about myself for taking this leap of faith and I have no regrets about it at all. Still i think it is unfair that my family and friends have no knowledge of this in any sense and they deserve to know. Even if i dont tell them, i am pretty sure they can see the difference anyway. So please, give me some advice, they are really much appreciated. Thank you so much really grateful for your efforts.

156,"Hey, you. A mechie friend from 3-5 years ago. I don't know if you'll ever see this message ( I hope you do), but I guess it's worth a try.

I don't know how you've been doing, after you went to Stanford (and your friend to Harvard, it's quite a pity I didn't get to know her better, I hope she's getting along well, and attached with her roommate) for your Masters, but I hope that you've been well. Who knows, maybe you've gotten married already.

Well, I won't be surprised if you don't remember who I am anymore, as with many other people, but hahaha, you've left quite an impression on me, so... I remember you. Not sure if the impression I left on you was positive.... *looks back* yeah... Don't think it's that good.

So, it's been a while, huh? I'm here to tell you, that sorry for being a few years late, but do watch the news on Friday, Dec 7th, or Saturday, Dec 8th. I did say something about building buses a few years back, eh? And I hoped that you'll see it.

Well, after many delays, and much of literal blood, sweat and tears, I've finally able to show you what I've built (aside from that modification I made to the nus shuttle buses, the front handrails are pretty small and unnoticeable, but hey, it's something). 

It's not much, it's a type of bus, not electrical or anything, nothing fanciful, but one day, I hope that you, and my other friends, will be taking one of the buses that are built under me.

Or helped to build. My colleagues and Production Supervisors worked, and pushed alongside me for this one. 

Oh, don't worry about replying, though. I uh, don't visit here often, and I don't have a social media account (aside from Google, because Youtube). In other words, you pretty much can only find me in person (I issue you... a challenge, I guess? If fate allows our paths to cross again, it'll be interesting to observe you again as a friend. Though, it's actually surprisingly easy to track me).

Hahahaha, need I say who I am? Perhaps, it's better for us to remain at a status of ""Hey, yooooouuuuu......... Uh, Paiseh arh, What's your name?"". After all, madman for a day, strangers the next, eh? I've changed considerably, and you'd most likely cannot recognize me any longer.

Anyways, if it's any clue, I'm an idiot who drew on the whiteboards of the PC Cluster in Engineering often. Who had, and still has, a lot of logical flaws. I fold flowers, and I like to eat the half spring chicken they used to sell at uTown Koufu. That, and I like to drink Kopi-O very specifically from the Arts Canteen (more... fragrant in the morning, imo). Yeah, that guy.

I lost it around the afternoon after my lab in the morning at E4-03-07 (Digital Electronics Lab). My routes can be traced from E4-03-07 and to E3-06-11 and then to EA level 2. I only lost it this afternoon :(

My route was probably E4-03-07, then I took a lift to E4 level 5, walked past some study benches and LT1/2 and towards the toilets near E3-06-08 which is also near a water cooler which is next to a staircase landing. Then I proceeded to E3-06-11 for a tutorial I wanted to ""crash"", but the tutorial was cancelled so I went to EA level 2 (via passing by LT7) and then I realized my bottle was not with me when I was at EA.

Although it is just a water bottle, it is something I have grown sentimental towards over the course of a few months. I got it during a holiday to Melbourne during the summer break.

I know maybe it does sounds funny, but this water bottle is my favourite water bottle :/

Looks like the normal way of getting a girlfriend in SG is by first building a relationship. But to build that relationship, you need something to associate with her by (eg. mutual friends, groupmates, classmates). Now, isn't that just luck?

How do you get near your crush, when you don't even get the chance?! Is it all just pure luck on whether you get to be classmates/groupmates/CCAmates with that girl you admire? I try joining CCAs and going for random events, yet all my crushes are those girls who are strangers that just walk by me and prob from another class/faculty/CCA. Am I just plain unlucky? Is love in SG all just luck?

222,"I'm a first-year student but I can see it's getting extremely hard to cope with my slow way of thinking. I usually sit through almost all of my lectures without even absorbing anything; basically wasting 2-3 hours of my day each time sitting there like an idiot. Yes, I can proudly say I go to school and come back home learning nothing.

This handicap has put me lagging tremendously far down compared to all my peers. Whenever tutorials come about, everyone would have done their work already while I'd have spent the night before still struggling to do topics from 2-3 weeks ago by myself and so in tutorials, I just sit there in class like a clueless idiot yet again. I'm like in an entirely different timezone.
And of course it's even worse when CP marks are involved which basically amounts to a test of whoever can think up of something to say the fastest.

This slow rate of thinking is so slow, I can't even grasp simple conversations with friends at times or instructions for say, an orientation game. It really makes me look like a fool to everyone most of the time when I'm actually not.

Sometimes, I don't even know how I made it to NUS to begin with. I guess my only redeeming factor is that with enough time I can grasp the knowledge, and that's only how I managed to always score well in exams. 

But would that translate to success in the working world? When employers all care about is having fast learners and quick human interactions, it certainly has me doubting just how l can possibly survive once I leave school.

However, going through the whole process this year, I felt that there are alot of things that the overall committee involved in IFG that can work upon.

Firstly, I do not think it is wise to use the ""backdoor"" approach to get people into committee, as you end up forming cliques and make others in your committee feel left out beyond the superficial fact of just being in a committee. What happen to openess and inclusivity?

Next, why is it necessary for Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson to be in every chat that exist anyway? Isnt the hierarchical structure already there to ensure work is done efficiently? Why must we allocate Sports Club MC to be the PD of different cells anyway? Capability to match up the role cannot be purely by who is in MC and who is not what!

Lastly, why is the structure of comm so segregated, almost like there is little interaction among the different comm. I mean we are one committee, would it not be necessary to know each other more to work better together? We all joined IFG for a reason, why the separation anyway?

Sports Club, while I respect your dedication and hard work, please make some good changes and work on all these problems or a lot of others will suffer unnecessarily for it

3. Enjoy different forms and levels of privilege

Sometimes I just can't help but feel disappointed that I might never be able to be just like them - not in the sense of being a perfect duplicate, but incorporating their qualities, their passions - into your own self and feel proud that you are becoming someone you would see as a role model.

318,"Hello RC4 Freshie #50945, I'm a RC4 senior who's going on exchange. I can assure you that RC4 is not as rabak as you imagine (or what others say). You are now an adult: you make your own choices and stick with the consequences. 

On the other hand, think about what opportunities you are missing out if you pull out? Making life-long and trustworthy friends? 

Many of my well trusted friends are made through RC4, and I certainly hope you can thrive in the college too. If there are something uncomfortable happening, I'm sure you have friends who you can confide in and if others are doing something bad and it's affecting you, you can always approach the team of friendly residential assistants and fellows of the college. They're always there for us.

All the best.

I dont think I should dive into a relationship for the sake of it, but im becoming less certain. I yearn for a lifelong relationship, but somehow I cant feel love or affection for anyone. It's as if that piece of emotion has disappeared like unused muscles, after a tear. I dont see myself getting attached in the foreseeable future, partly because Im not naturally close to any girl.

My planner is essentially my lifeline to knowing what I need to do everyday because I have extremely poor working memory. I usually carry the planner everywhere I go, but today I was preoccupied with tough decisions that I needed to make for the near future.

400,"#46977: well, perhaps, you aren’t looking at the whole picture. Take a step back, look at what is happening around you, understand the other party, what he is going through, how he is like, better, before making your judgement. 

At the end of the day, he did not confess to you, nor did he stand up for you, so why bother?

As, well, a person who was the other party, I’d say that people like you are “the ones who got away”. We regret it. That guy will regret it. However, given the circumstances at that time...

Turn back time a bit, around... 4 years ago? Hahas, it’s the same time, I suppose. 

I just got out of quite a bad relationship. First love, quite a bad fallout. Joined a cca, met this girl, thought she could click quite well with me. Thought she was the one. 

Then there was another guy. Someone who could make her laugh. Someone who has the resources to help secure her future. Someone whom I thought would cherish her, and give her the laughter and happiness I could not. I don’t really have that sense of humour people have, nor  can I comprehend the simplicity of the typical human thought enough.

I pushed. The stress was immense. I broke down quite a bit because of this. Shut myself away from her. It was not fair for her to be my rebound. Focused on my studies, after coming from quite a bad overseas trip (for me, imagine up in the middle of the hills and villages, you see her and that guy cuddling all the way... for a whole month. Just trapped there with them, because we’re in the middle of nowhere. Not a good feeling.)

In that year I was gone, jerkbag broke up with her. Something happened to her, that I was not around for her for. I could never face her, nor   look at her in the eye again. 

When she resurfaced recently at somewhere I started to hang out quite recently, I was shocked to see her again. Freaking nervous. Now, well, she just sees me as a weirdo, on the borderline of harassing(?) her. Well, I don’t even do anything nowadays, though.

Looking back, I should have done more for her. Now I see her, I can only lament. She’s with a better guy now, I can only hope he’ll treat her well. 

If possible, I’d never, ever want to appear in front of her ever again. Ever. I’ll just find my other friends at other places, I suppose. I will make that effort to disappear before her again, so I won’t have to face her, and still find out that I still like her and care for her a lot.

So. For that guy, the way I see it, you had 2 options: reach out to him, understand him better, or just “hey, it’s a waste of my time,” and move on like everyone else did.

You had. 

I suppose you took the latter, it’s typical, and frankly speaking, good for you.

Please don't ever cut ur bangs 
","Lost and Found, Romance

416,"My mother grew up in a family that clearly privileges the males in the household disproportionately more. It doesn't help that she only has one male sibling. 

The only male heir was the centre of the entire family. He was the youngest, because they tried several times in hope that they would conceive a son.

She is the eldest sister. And being the eldest in the 60s-70s meant that she had to shoulder a huge portion of the domestic chores, caring for younger siblings, etc. She was her mother's best helper, the one who knew all along the silent hardships and untold sufferings that my grandma kept to herself. 

But my mother, despite all her contributions to the family, was not well-appreciated. 

She never got to eat the drumstick during special occasions. She never got the extra dollars to get new clothes for the year. What extra resources was available in her poor household went to the golden boy. The one who had the right biological composition and genitalia to become the symbol of hope and progress for the family. 

She grew hard under the abuse and indignities of favouritism. She knew that it was unfair her and her sisters were doing so much but her brother remained the only one who was praised for tiny steps. 

She even had to fight to pursue her education in diploma. She got it on scholarship, much to the resistance of her parents. 

Even though the diploma education was sponsored, it was not free because it took up two years, and time is money because she could have been working to provide for her brother's education. I am glad she insisted on the diploma for herself. At least she could break out of where she came from and to Singapore. She was most successful amongst her siblings to break out of the poverty trap.

And, when my grandma suffered a stroke, she depleted all her CPF savings (10 years of slogging her guts out) to pay the high cost of hospital treatment and nursing home fees as a PR. 

Fast forward, my mother, now a 50 years old woman is now living a relatively adequate life. Not rich, not even close. But just enough to live without fearing  insufficiency.

Both her children are in university. Intergenerational mobility seems to be looking promising for her. But as her daughter, I see and experience it - the continuity of the ""son privilege"" tradition.

I cannot believe my mother would continue to practise a habit that she suffered so much for. My mother loves my brother very much. It has reached a point she doesn't bother to cover up the bias. I used to beg my father to persuade her to love me a little more but that was ten years ago. 

How does she not understand the importance of treating and loving your children equally? Does she want me to go through the exact same troubles she had when younger? 

When you play favourites with the children, you divide the family inevitably. You estrange your child from yourself and the siblings from each other. In a nuclear family with average one two children, can two siblings afford to be on bad terms? Who will they rely on as they become older? 

Why wouldn't she think of it? This is the part that infuriates me the most - not even the actual favouritism. But the very fact that you have first-hand experience of being the neglected child and yet you CHOSE to let it happen again. 

I love my mother, but maybe because I feel obligated to. I love my mother in a way that is never consistent. How can I be consistent? I get food, shelter, warmth and free home Wi-Fi. 

But I don't have love.  

Oh. And she doesn't keep in much contact with her brother ever since.

Real one.

Discussion about who should pay on dates and Ben's pragmatic thoughts. But I want to talk about it from a wider perspective. Because if your ultimate goal is to maximise the chance of your first date leading to another and another boils down to knowing whether you should pay for it (or not), then you have asked the wrong question.

However, first let me say that for undergrad uni students (I presume to be the majority audience here), the dating environment will change very quickly once you exit uni and go into the working world, and Ben's advice will be much less useful then (alternatively, just as irrelevant then, depending on your views).

But let's talk about the context of being in uni: you're young, stupid, poor, and have a lot of free time (you think that last part is not true - you'll find out otherwise once it's too late to appreciate it). These traits characterise most uni students, regardless of gender.

Hold that thought.

Allow me to segue to a wider point - the dating metagame is nested within an even bigger metagame that is your life. I don't mean your everyday pedestrian life. I mean what you consider your life's purpose and goals are. You may not think of this consciously, but you act on these all the time; for example, you are in uni because at least one of these are probably true: you value the pursuit of the knowledge you are currently attempting to attain (knowledge pursuit), you do it because you have no idea what else to do (pursuing path of least resistance/following peer/societal/familial pressure), you are seeking to improve your future earning potential (pragmatism).

I would say the first priority for someone of your age is to think about and establish your goals in life and how you will work towards them. Only if you have goals can you derive purpose. Why? *Because a sense of meaning and purpose in life are obtained by moving closer to your goals* The converse is also true - if you have no goals, then you cannot be disappointed, because you cannot fail if you were not aiming for anything in the first place. And kids learn very quickly a sense of shame or embarrassment from failing (from adults and from their peers), so they avoid it by never setting or declaring any goals. 

There is a potential discussion here about Singapore society stigmatising failure and the resultant lack of innovation/creativity, but I want to stay on point.

Ok back to goals and purpose. In Singapore, we are free (don't laugh). People, especially young people like you immediately think ""shiok, there are so many things I can do and say and no one can stop me!"". Which is true, but is also narrow minded. Because freedom means people are also free to do nothing. And you know what? Most people exercise their freedom to do just that.

It may not be very obvious to an undergrad, but once you get off the ferris wheel of education, grades hardly matter. What matters are your accomplishments. When you say you really love animals, I want to know how many times you volunteer at a vet clinic or animal shelter or dogsit for people who go on vacation. I am not interested in how many hours a day you spend watching cat videos on youtube. When you say you really love food, I want to know which recipes you have perfected and taken to the next level, not which restaurants you have eaten at. Because people care about action, they don't care about claims which cannot be substantiated. 

Imagine being told :this product very good one, everyone uses it! When asked who uses it: errr .... aiya, so many... a lot la, you just ask around! The second statement contradicts the first - the intended impression that the sales person wants to convey is that a lot of people use it, but he/she is unable to substantiate or particularise that claim, so how it really be so commonly used?

So if you haven't, and I'd wager that the majority of you haven't, it's time to ask yourself what do I want to be? As the children's ditty goes: rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief; #doctor, #lawyer, Indian Chief.

So what's the relevance of this unsolicited boring advice? It is that if you set yourself meaningful goals and actively work towards them, you will have a sense of meaning and purpose in life, and thereby carry yourself with confidence and have meaningful things to talk about with people. When you do, then others will preferentially consider you as a mating candidate compared to those who do not! I would wager that this is such a big advantage over others who do not do this that the question of whether the boy pays for the meal or not will become irrelevant if you manage to do this.

The best part of this is: even if that date doesn't go well, you still have the fact that you are leading a meaningful life moving closer to your goals, so you still win in the most important metagame out there!

Some additional points:
1. This is equally applicable to boys and girls - so none of that gender blah blah here
2. This rests entirely on your goals being truly meaningful. What is meaningful? Well like I said you are free - free to decide what that 'meaningful' means. What, you thought being free meant no responsibilities? Wrong - you are free to choose whatever you want (from your options available at the time), but you also have to accept the consequences of your choices.
3. Suppose you do the above, and he (or she) still doesn't want to go out with you on another date (suppose for the sake of argument they say it's entirely because you didn't offer to pay). Congratulations - you have dodged a bullet, and there are others who will be willing to go out with you in the near future (or already, you just don't know it yet).
4. I will only reply to replies in this thread, so if you want a response from me, please reply here only.
5. There is a reference to my identity somewhere here if I somehow need to verify myself as author.

Summary: concentrate on the big picture and don't sweat the small stuff. Prioritise personal development and goal setting - if you manage to do that, dating will sort itself out. If you don't manage to do that, dating will not provide you satisfaction or happiness.

425,"For fellow commuters of the NUS shuttle bus:

To those who refuse to move in and take a seat on the NUS shuttle buses, please stop doing it. There is nothing at the back to be afraid of. Should be put dollar notes there for incentive? 
 
Watching the illogical emptiness at the back of the bus while gripped with desperation to get up the bus is immensely frustrating. 

Everyone (98%) is going to get down at Utown, KR mrt or some other common nexus point in school with high flows of human traffic. So don't worry. You will get off the bus. Even if you are at the back of it. Trust me.

To those waiting to board the bus, stop crowding the entrance. Surely we don't need an entire research to prove that blocking the entrance of the bus where people alight will cause only greater inefficiency. 

Don't ""tsk"" if someone steps on your foot as a consequence of where you are standing. You are more likely to be stepped by standing there. Sounds harsh, but it is true. 

To those who like to talk and chat WHILE boarding and alighting, please hold your conversations until you are in the bus space or outside. We all want to get up and get out quickly. Nobody wants to hear about your one night stand or whether you are hungry. We can't leave if you keep turning your head round to continue your talking while shuffling 0% out of the bus.

To those who swing wildly while clutching onto the dangling handlebars, your bag smashing into my abdomen and ribcage hurts. Please try to gain some stability and balance. I know its fun to swing around but it hurts me.

Let's make our trips around school a more pleasant journey!

483,"Hi guys, so I went for a briefing for exchanges in Korea on 22/11/2017 (Wednesday), and I met with a group of people who are heading to Hanyang University for Winter School and they added their names and contact numbers into the notes app in my phone. Only that, this note didn't autosave. And I accidentally closed all my apps so there went that list of numbers and names. 

If you're one of the group of 6 people who gathered together after the briefing, going for HIWS, please comment below, I'll send you guys a message on facebook. I'm so so so sorry for losing your contact details with my fat thumb. I would wanna meet you guys in Korea! :)

Please help by sharing this post!! I really appreciate every single share.

Please help to spread around and ask if any of your friends may have dropped it while studying at ERC from about ~10am. It could be important to them!

Take care of your belongings and all the best to everyone for your finals!

485,"Responding to #43593 thanks for your sharing. Gold diggers are a real problem in my relationships and friendships, and I experience this not only with relationships, but with friendships with my guy-friends.

Singaporeans are basically gold diggers. All my friends talk about is about money and being rich one day, some of them even like to show of their flashy cars and branded goods as though their self-worth is tied to their wallet or their car, or house... Some people who even behave differently because they think they are wealthy, I know of people who boast of not taking public transport and how much their parents make. Well, as a person who's bank interest probably surpasses some people's net family income, I find this kind of behaviour extremely disgusting. I don't see the problem with taking public transport, or wearing cheap stuff, in fact I do it all the time... 

Moreover I do these kind of things because I see how some of my friends worship money like a God, and always attempt to leach on wealthy people, or want to make friends with them, not knowing that I am of considerable wealth myself. 

I've become really afraid to reveal my ""true"" identity because I don't want to be treated differently. To have friends ask me for drinks etc and treat me ""better"" to gain my favour. I don't want to have gold diggers surround me like flies and I don't want people to view me as a walking money bag. 

Thus far, I've never brought any of my friends to my place because I don't want them to think differently of me. I'm always more guarded about my background, and am generally more introverted because of this. I know other wealthy people in school who also do this, we walk amongst you but hide our true identity because frankly lots of Singaporeans are superficial and materialistic, and we don't wish to be party to this culture and be made used of.

So if you are the owner please comment below so that I can return you your piglet and also have a meal with you if possible. :)

503,"A girl in NM1101e has been catching my eye since the first few weeks of school, but I haven't plucked up the courage to approach her face to face. She sits near the back, with 2 other girls, I think are her friends. Recently she seems to be always sticking around a guy also from NM, and I feel so dejected because I don't know if they are together. She has shoulder length hair and always has a smile :) on her face. If you're reading this, I just want to wish you all the best with the guy you're seeing now. As dejected and demoralised I am, I still hope that you will find your happiness. Maybe one day when I have enough courage, I will then be able to ask you out for a meal. For now, I can only express my love for you through this platform... Or if anyone has any idea what her name is, please do leave it down below! [FYI: she doesn't wear specs, brown-black hair, i think her laptop's wallpaper is a picture of a dog: very cute btw]

Lost my matric card with matric no A0***719R somewhere within the vicinity of COM1 building today, more specifically around levels B1 and 1 and also possibly the male washroom located behind the biz canteen. It is my first loss and I have made a loss report.

Hope there is a kind soul who helps return it to security post at COM2. Otherwise, you may email me personally with an attached screenshot of the front of the card at jedresfan@gmail.com and I will be more than happy to pay you S$30 cold hard cash or wire to your DBS PayLah! account.
