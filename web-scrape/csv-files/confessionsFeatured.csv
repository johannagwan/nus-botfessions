2,"Seeking for honest opinions. Sorry, it will be a very long story. No trolls please.
I'm average-looking and I’m currently going out with a guy that’s 7 years older than me and is a working adult. He is attractive, smart, modest, humorous, has a well-paying job, very popular and most important of all, he has a good personality. I have some mutual friends that that has told me that he always tries his best to keep a distance from girls that approaches him as well.

We really love each other and always make consistent effort to try our best to spend time with each other, with him working around with his hectic working life and with me managing my examinations, projects, etc. He treats me very well, understands me, and is always the first to notice if I’m in a sour mood after going through a bad day. Occasionally we do have our quarrels and fights due to our differences, but we managed to resolve it and stick together despite it all, accepting the other for who we are. In overall, we are together with each other for a good 1.5 years.

I know all of this sounds too good to be true, and all this while I'm trying my best to improve myself to be better - be it in terms of working on my appearance, personality, learning new skills, etc. so that I would be able to better match up with him.

But here's the catch – at the beginning of the relationship, my family knows about it and objects to him, saying that he's too good for me and that he's not taking me seriously, as well as saying about some other really nasty stuff about him without knowing him all that well, which was not really fair to him. Of course, knowing that it definitely wasn't true, I tried to speak up for him, but they said that I was very blinded by him and that I should really face reality and wake up, why would someone of such a good calibre want me. 

I discussed about this with him and it landed a really huge blow to him, as he's really very concerned about the opinions of the people around me and he was depressed for quite a long period of time. He was really understanding and understands that my family just wanted the best for me and that it was normal for parents to be protective of their child, but was still very hurt from their comments nonetheless. He told me that it’s okay and I should not worry my family, let them think that we have broken off, and keep our relationship from my family for the time being and we will figure out a way to solve this somehow eventually. I tried to talk to him, cheer him up, but to no avail. We continued sticking together and after a few months, he went back to his normal cheerful self. My family still suspects me going out with him from time to time and was quite unhappy, but kept silent about it, only occasionally dropping hints here and there and prompted me about it.

He was very depressed to the point where his family noticed the changes in him, and was really concerned about him. After asking him about it and knowing about my family’s objections and hurtful remarks, his family, who had really liked me at the start, started hating on me with the same intensity of how much they had liked me previously. They were really angered by my family’s unjustified comments about their son. I only knew about later on where he kept me knowing about this all this while and only briefly told me that his family knows about this matter a year later. However, he did not tell me that his family hated me because he was afraid that I would be hurt. It was only then afterwards where I found out from my mutual friends about they hated me.

His family knows that we are still together and although they disagree to it, they still respected my S/O’s opinion and did not say anything much about us. However, recently, his family has started rushing him for marriage and asked when would he be able to bring a good partner home, to which, he replied to them jokingly to give him a year and he would find one girl to bring home (cause he’s in his late 20s, they are worried, and I think, they really object to us being together, hence asking those). He did not tell me about this because he was scared that I would overthink, it was from the mutual friend where I found out about this.  

Honestly, I don't know what to do anymore. I’m having thoughts where I think I’m keeping him from finding his right one, but still, I really don’t want to leave him. I’m not telling him about this because I do not want him to worry about me. I’m very confused. What are your opinions on this?

It is really odd to know a lot about the guy before meeting him IRL. Also, since I know so much, like family tree, associations, income level, and sometimes even estimated net worth, grades and habits, I often get so tense worrying and second guessing my words, in case I reveal more than I should know.

I've talked and insisted to my mom not to do this many times, but she refuses to give in. At the same time, I love and trust my mom so I will always tell her who I'm currently dating. Not sure what to do.

8,"Imagine this: Your first date last night went well. The two of you began the date as strangers, but left holding hands like a couple on honeymoon. Perhaps the two of you went on to do other things typical of couples on honeymoon, things which the said couple will only begin to regret some nine months later. Its ok: We are a judgement-free community here at NUSWhispers. Whatever happened last night, it is a new morning now, which means it is time to plan for the next date! 

Resist the urge to text back immediately. From previous posts on NUSWhispers, you should be familiar the secret of baby powder and friendship bracelets. Don't let the beeping of his phone spoil the magic moment as your guy wakes up drunk on the strangely familiar yet intoxicating scent of baby powder and the lingering memory of your smooth and supple hands gliding up and down and up and down and up and down... your friendship bracelet. Give him time. He will text you first. 

While you wait for the guy to text back, I recommend that you ransack your cupboard/storeroom for an important yet underappreciated item: the JC hoodie. Poly and Uni hoodies are NOT an acceptable substitute. What to do with the JC Hoodie follows many of the principles set out in the baby powder and friendship bracelet posts. 

1. Recall that baby powder seeks to subconsciously evoke the image of babies and hence babymaking.  In a similar manner, the JC hoodie seeks to subconsciously evoke the memory of your date's first (serious) crush. At this stage, you have no idea whether your date's crush is the school valedictorian or the head cheerleader, a catholic schoolgirl or a foul-mouthed lian. It dosen't matter. Just wear the JC hoodie on the second date, and follow his gaze as he mentally undresses you. Let his eyes tell you all about his first crush, and it will be obvious how you should continue. 

2. Like the friendship bracelet, the JC hoodie is an excellent conversation starter: By talking about the friendship bracelet on the first date, and the JC hoodie on the second, you ensure that your date's gaze remains transfixed on some part of your body. Leave all the meaningful conversations about hopes, dreams and values to your friendzone. Remember: This is a date. Your favorite bible passage is 2 Samuel Chapter 13. 

3. Like the friendship bracelet, the JC Hoodie helps you to initiate physical contact. Recall that when you play with your friendship bracelet, the movement of your hands across the bracelet hint to your date how you want to touch him. When you play with your JC hoodie, the movement of the sleeves on the hoodie hint to your date how you want him to touch you. 

Hence, on your second date, start with the hoodie fully zipped up, but gradually unzip as the day progresses. Find an excuse under the hot singaporean sun to give your date the pleasure of taking it off. When sitting down for dinner, wrap the hoodie around your butt, your lap, your waist, your breast, your shoulders. Cover all your sensitive spots with the hoodie, or alternatively cover everything but your sensitive spots. Let both of your imaginations run wild.  

Above all, remember that the texture of the hoodie is different from the texture of normal clothes, which is different from the texture of lingerie, which is different from the texture of bare skin. Educate your date on the subtle differences between each of these. Let him learn to recognize each by touch. Let him learn your language of love. Let him be the first to say ""I love you"".

How far should a university’s disciplinary board go in a criminal matter?

I believe many people have read about a current female NUS student’s (let’s call her Ms M) recount of the horrible criminal act that was committed against her when a male student used his handphone to film her while she was showering. It is a horrible experience which, in the words of a very esteemed female professor whom I once heard say during a disciplinary board meeting over a similar peeping case – “It is a horrible experience which makes female students feel utterly unsafe on campus and the trauma is difficult to erase.”

So without a doubt, the act of being filmed in a shower is a very traumatising one and it is hoped that Ms M has received full support in helping her mitigate and hopefully overcome this mental trauma. Such criminal act has no place in a civilised society and no other NUS student, male or female, should be a victim of such acts.

That said, was Ms M justified in calling for NUS to mete out heavier punishment (which currently stands at a semester’s suspension and the perpetrator made to write an apology letter to Ms M) and basically expel the perpetrator? As someone who used to sit on the NUS Board of Discipline (“BOD”) as a NUSSU student rep (albeit back in 2013-2014 before the #metoo era), I think the matter is more nuanced.

1. Proper channel of recourse in criminal matter

If you look at what Ms M recounted, the matter was reported to the police, complete with CCTV evidence etc. Then, after investigations, the perpetrator was given a conditional 12-month warning period in lieu of prosecution. More damningly, Ms M said that the investigation officer told her to look for NUS if she wanted “heavier punishment”.

That’s when I think parties got things wrong.

In the criminal justice system, the Public Prosecutor (also concurrently the Attorney General) is the one, working with the Singapore Police Force (“SPF”), who decides whether to bring charges in a criminal matter, and if yes, what kind of charges to bring. It is not and should not be the province of NUS to bring criminal charges or mete out criminal punishment.

In this case, it is apparent that the good folks at the Attorney General’s Chambers (“AGC”) and SPF have decided not to press charges and instead issue a conditional warning period in lieu of prosecution. Legally speaking, that is and should be the end of the course of seeking criminal justice in this matter, simply because the person vested with prosecution powers (i.e. the Public Prosecutor) has made the decision not to press charges. The investigation officer should not have asked Ms M to ask NUS for “heavier punishment” because the criminal justice has run its course in this matter here. NUS does not have, and should not have, the powers to mete out criminal punishment or bring criminal charges.

2. Jurisdiction of NUS Board of Discipline

This was a question pondered by some of the BODs I sat on – what is the source of NUS’ disciplinary powers? My suggested answer, which didn’t get challenged, is that it arises from the contract signed between the student and NUS. The power to discipline has a contractual source but it may have a quasi-criminal nature due to the nature of disciplinary processes.

During the course of my time on NUS’ BODs, there are many cases where there is an act that has a criminal element. The standard NUS BOD practice, back in 2014, was to wait for the criminal proceedings to end before proceeding with the NUS disciplinary process. Although both proceedings arise from the same facts, they are of a different nature. The criminal proceeding arises from the public’s interest in ensuring that criminal conduct does not go unpunished. NUS’ disciplinary process arises from the university’s interest in ensuring that the rules and spirit of academia are kept in place and that students do not misbehave in the context of the university-student or student-student relationships/context.

To give an example, let’s say a student has been caught stealing outside. The criminal proceedings are for the act of stealing and how it harmed the public’s interest. The NUS disciplinary process is for how the act brought the university into disrepute. Fine but important difference – the NUS disciplinary process is and should never be a substitute for the criminal justice system. It is at best complementary but not a substitute.

3. Proportionality of sanctions

One controversial point raised by Ms M was that the sanctions meted out by the NUS BOD to the perpetrator (a semester’s suspension + write a private apology letter to Ms M the victim) is vastly disproportionate to the act itself. I make no comments on the proportionality of the sanction to the act, except that back in 2013-2014, the types of acts that attract expulsion from NUS usually involve academic dishonesty. Examples include repeated cheating, falsification of experiment results, fraudulent declarations during admission etc. It is not difficult to understand why – the university’s main interest is to maintain the integrity of the academia environment. Academic dishonesty strikes at the root of such integrity and therefore deserves the highest sanction – expulsion. Unfortunately, peeping and filming in showers/toilets did not fall within that category of acts that attract expulsion. Suspension and fine, yes, but not expulsion. At least not back in 2013-2014.

That being said, in the half-decade since, society has gotten more sensitised and enlightened over sexual assault, harassment and crime. I am sure the NUS administration will review the range of sanctions for different acts and update them to be in line with societal norms and expectations.

4. Pressure to keep things under wraps

I posted this earlier on Sheryl's post and I will repeat it here ad verbatim: “Can I just put it on record here that I once sat on a Board of Discipline regarding a peeping case in one of the Residential Colleges back in 2014. For context, the Board of Discipline is convened by the Registrar’s Office so it depends on the case being floated up or complaints made directly to the main university administration. What shocked the particular Board I was on was that the student being charged for peeping in showers was not a first time offender. Apparently the RC senior admin wanted to just give him an RC level disciplinary measure and keep it under wraps at the RC level. When the incident occurred the second time, they couldn’t contain it anymore.”

I think there is a bit of implicit pressure not to let things blow up at different levels of the NUS administration, from the university level (e.g. Registrar’s office) to the faculty or residential college/hall level. Perhaps something that should be considered is that clear and expeditious reporting of such acts should be mandatory and incentivised so that university administrators at all levels will feel no pressure to keep such acts under wraps. It will only be good for the university community at large.

5. Concluding thoughts

This is a horrible act by the perpetrator against a victim who was helpless (she was showering). He should not have done it even if it was allegedly under alcoholic influence (if you are drunk, go pass out on your own bed for the night). I feel for Ms M. After all, my wife, my sister and many other female friends stayed on campus and I shudder to think the trauma they would have felt in a similar situation.

Yet, I do not think NUS BOD is the best channel to address the seemingly disproportionately minor sanctions. The right course of redress is the criminal justice system. I am sure the good folks at AGC and SPF have their reasons, and I will leave it at that. Ms M may be better served by appealing through the usual political redress channels to have AGC and SPF revisit the case. Forcing NUS to serve criminal sanctions is a bad precedent that we should be hesitant to allow.

15,"Dear Prof Ben, actually I have emailed you and PM you in facebook but I don't know which platform you active the most.
I am a year 1 chemical engineering student and I would like to hear an advice or even a solution from you. I intend to take a Second Major in Computer Science programme. Thus, I have to complete 48 MCs to get the title. So, initially, I would like to take CS1010S in AY18/19 (this academic year) sem 1, I have placed an advanced bid in round 1C. However, my advanced bid suddenly gone in round 2A and I never get a chance to bid again. I thought that the quota is already full. But after the bidding stats are released, there are still about 15 vacancies, making me questioning the reasons why I could not place a bid. In this semester, I would like to try bid for CS1010S. However, this time is even worse, there is no CS1010S option for me at all. There are only CS1010 and CS1010E as options of the equivalent which both modules' sectional teaching clash with my core mods lectures. Leaving me with either CS1010S or CS1010X as an option. For me, it is impossible to catch up for the second major if I take the CS1010 equivalent in semester 3. I have already emailed Dr. Leong Wai Kay as the module coordinator and he suggested me to contact the CS undergrad department. After I emailed the department, they said CS1010S' quota are limited and so on so they could not offer me the modules. Therefore, I would like to find advice and answers from you. First, for CS1010X, I know it's for NS students, but if in my urgent condition, how can I register myself as a CS1010X student? Also, should I take a risk to wait for CS1010S until round 3B and appeal via CORS whether if there's still any vacancies (which they may or may not offer me the module even if there are still vacancies). I am looking forward for your advice and answer because I am in really urgent condition.

16,"To #54896. Just like you, I have attempted suicide twice in my life. One year after another. After the first suicide, I felt like things never change and I just suck and therefore leading to my second suicide. As naive as it may sound, my suicide was due to friendship issues, some family issues and academic issues. I seriously felt like I never meant to be alive in the first place. Like I was born to be tortured emotionally and mentally. So I should just leave the world so that the world will be happier without me. And that's MY thoughts, all my thoughts when I attempted suicide. 

But I was wrong, my friends who love me aren't gonna be happy without me, my family is not a complete family without me, my school tutorial would be a little different without my presence. But i never knew that, until people told me about it.

Human nature tends to be more outspoken with criticism but not the praises and therefore we always feel like the world hates us. But after my second suicide, one teacher came to me and told me she believes in me and my ability. It was my first time hearing that sentence from a teacher when the rest of the teachers were just trying to find fault in me. One friend also came to me to tell me she would help me with my studies.. to be honest, I felt like I have heard these before, but because of my negative mentality, i chose to listen to the negative aspects if everything I hear, even if they meant well. 

Well, it has been 12 years since I last attempted suicide. Sometimes the thoughts still appears when I gets really upset or stressful but I realised it is my CHOICE to listen and do what's helpful for me and not by NATURE that I am always unlucky. Currently I'm happily employed working full time in an amazing environment. Because I know how it feels to not get praises when needed, I turn this into my habit to always praise people when needed, be nice when i give feedback and ensuring everyone's mental emotions are well taken care of. Because i know how it feels and i wouldn't want them to go through what i did, so i came back as the stronger one, to advocate for healthy mental wellness for everyone around me :) 

Do take a break, do some mediation and enjoy some along time before you start your engine again. Clear you negative thoughts and you'll be fine :)

17,"This post is intended to provide a balanced view with  regards to NUSSU Internal Council Election yesterday.

*Disclaimer: I was there as an observer and asked a number of questions to both Presidential Candidates. I am not associated with any clubs, any parties or whatsoever. The views and opinions expressed below shall reflect mine and mine only.

I am a Y4 student who have never once interested in NUSSU's affairs. To be honest, I am just a typical apathetic NUS student who mind my own business throughout my 4 years in NUS. However, something drew my attention during this NUSSU election. It was none other than the manifesto put forward by the concerned students' (CNS) team. I was strongly motivated by their their agenda which captured the ideals and values that I religiously believe in. Hence, I exercised my right to vote for the first time and voted for them. Although I personally  know the 2 candidates  (belonging to the so-called ""Insider Team"") that are representing my constituency since both of them are from my major, I still voted for the CNS
representative. I really had full faith in CNS. 

However, I also came to realise that I have yet to hear much from the other team and understand their side of the story. Besides that, I also wanted to see the candidates physically, especially the Presidential Candidates, and assess how dedicated and committed they are to their campaign promises. I thus decided to attend the meeting yesterday. I honestly did expect a fair bit of commotions and drama,  especially given that it has been such a contentious and controversial election campaign. In fact, I was also interested to know how each candidate would respond to questions on the importance of having an united NUSSU exco regardless of parties (I did raise a qn on this to both candidates) as I am of a view that  now is the time to put aside the differences and work together as one. 

CNS Presidental Candidate was the first to present which followed by a Q and A session.  I found him eloquent, idealisitc, determined and knowledgeable throughout the entire process. I was pretty impressed. I felt that he does deserve to be the President of NUSSU. 

Next was the Presidential Candidate from the so-called ""Insider Team"". He did a pretty simple presentation mainly emphasising on his motivations to run for the post and his past experiences, which then followed by a Q and A session. I found him frank, understanding, sincere and pragmatic. To be honest, he did not impress me as much as CNS Presidential Candidate especially in terms of presentation. However, he did one thing that took my breath away. His frank and humble  admission to the council that he is neither a visionary nor a strong communicator. To me, the fact that he is willing to lower himself and tell everyone that he is an imperfect being like everyone else instead of portraying himself as a perfect leader who is above everyone else is a good indication that he is not an elitist and that he truly believes in the philosophy of servant leadership. Moreover, I was really blown away by his track record in advocating for the welfare of disabled students as he could easily recall their names and explained with concrete examples what he proposed to the NUS management in his capacity as depty welfare sec for them. Only then, I realised how sincere and genuine this guy is unlike how some people have tried to portray him online. It then hit me that I should not have judged him based on a 3rd party's opinions (especially if the defamations made are anonymous).

Although I dont wish to end this post on a negative note, I would like to highlight that I was totally appalled by the conduct of some of the CNS candidates and their allies during the Q and A session for the ""Insider Team"" Presidential Candidate as they were not only harping on his marginal win as a candidate representing his constituency but also getting emotional and raising voices towards the candidate. These kind of disrespectful acts are uncalled for in a civilised setting. Please refrain from such acts during the second session later today. Do remember that getting emtional does not solve any problems and issues. I am extremely disappointed to see such behaviors in people that I have voted in with full faith. 

By the way, please stop playing
politics guys. No one is going to benefit from it in the long run. Do grow up please. 

With best intentions,

18,"Recently, I was very inspired by the mental health awareness campaign Beyond  The Label launched this month by NCSS. I knew some of the ambassadors of this movement because they came out with their mental health struggles openly, even with the stigma surrounding them. 

I like to share my challenges here, and hopefully encourage people to share theirs. The best way to get rid of prejudice is by listening,  understanding and empathising. I don't know who would care about what I have to say - but I know that it has always made me feel better when I read similar struggles by others and I know I'm not alone. 

I am not clinically diagnosed with any sort of mental disorder, but I am a generally anxious person who gets worried way, way, WAY too easily. Just because there's no official diagnosis from the doctor doesn't mean the symptoms is less severe/paralysing.

I can ruminate on the same things for hours on end each day - just trying to connect all the possible causes, reasons, factors why the things that happened to me happened, and what the bigger problems are that lie ahead of me. 

I contemplate suicide on a weekly basis, I google ""I want to die"" more times than I can remember. I have almost concrete plans on how I want to leave - including plucking up the courage to write goodbye notes to my loved ones. Never completed them though - it felt too painful to write on.

When I tell people I think I'm not gonna live past a certain number of years, I see skepticism in their eyes. I know they don't believe me when I say I want to die. I wish i could choose not to believe in myself too.  

Last month has been my worst struggle with this anxious/depressed mood. A slew of unfortunate things hit me in unexpected and continuous waves. I was swept by the harsh currents of life's maelstrom and I am still slowly piecing myself back together from the utter wreckage that is my current existence. Sometimes the half-built puzzle threatens to crumble entirely. 

My health is irretrievably in shambles, the one I trusted most has left me at my most vulnerable state, I'm struggling to keep up in school, my family is distant and aloof. 

Everyday feels like a struggle to wake yourself up. Sometimes I hope to sleep much longer because reality is so painful to confront.

But I'm still here. 

And that's the most important thing guess? Sometimes I have to remind myself how strong I am because despite all of that which has smacked me, I am still here. I'm still breathing, existing, trying even I'm failing to succeed. 

Amidst the pleas of ""please kill yourself"" roaring through my head, I hear a tiny whisper, barely audible but  unmistakable - 

""Keep holding on."" I hope you hold on too.

-Arts Club showed an outsized turnout of 455 valid votes cast, the largest among the faculty clubs. Even accounting for FASS being the largest faculty, the percentage is still higher than almost all other clubs, reflecting a more politically engaged student body.

-Clubs which were not contested at all, such as Business and Science, showed a correspondingly depressed turnout.

-The insider team's presidential candidate came within 14 votes of losing his seat in Computing Club, despite it being an uncontested race, and was the poorest-performing candidate to be elected. Another sign of the massive drama surrounding this election, as he was previously elected president of Computing Club 2 years previous.

-SDE had the challenger team's single losing candidate, losing by a wide margin to the insiders' two candidates.

-Engineering Club had the most exciting race of all, with candidates on both sides being popular among the student body and the challenger team's presidential candidate running there. It came down to an extremely narrow victory for the challenger team, with 6 votes separating their less popular candidate from the insider's more popular candidate. Percentage turnout for the vote, however, was below the average for contested faculty clubs.

-University Scholars Club (the faculty club for USP) had both the highest turnout by far (305 valid votes out of a total population of ~800) and the highest approval rating for the challenger team's (uncontested) candidate, at 98.7%. As USP students can vote both here and in their respective faculties, this offers some insight into how critical USP and Tembusu support was for the challenger team, in particular for RC-Engin students who most likely decided the ~20 vote winning margins in Engin club.

-For the non-faculty clubs, the real shocker was in NUSPA, an uncontested race with one challenger and one insider candidate. The insider candidate failed the vote of confidence by 15 votes, in an election limited to Singapore Citizens, depriving them of a critical exco rep seat.

As it stands, the challenger team has lost by a hair's breadth, with 9 candidates elected to the insiders' 11. The next round of elections for NUSSU positions will be internal, limited to those elected here and representatives from the constituent clubs.

21,"Hello! We are the NUS Students’ Unusually Casual Critique Board (also known as NUSSUCCB). We are back again after being dormant for 2 years. Our only previous post so far is #24503.

We have been aroused from our slumber by a challenger team in the NUSSU (no affiliation to NUSSUCCB) elections, specifically their manifesto where they mentioned ""the huge growth in NUS undergraduate tuition fees across the past decade from 2007 to 2016"". We decided to do some digging and data crunching on our part on the growth in tuition fees for the various courses since AY07/08. We also did a comparison with the Consumer Price Index (depicted in the bright red line near the bottom).

Our conclusion - growth in net undergraduate tuition fees payable (after deducting MOE Tuition Grant) has generally outstripped inflation as represented by CPI. Perhaps the challenger team may be onto something after all...

Alright, back to our slumber.

22,"What do pharmacy students work as when they graduate other than becoming a pharmacist? I find it quite weird that they work so hard for 4 years to get their degree and only come out to work at like hospital pharmacies behind the counter and just listening to the prescriptions from doctors? This may seem like quite a dumb question but I really wanna know what they do. 

Prior to getting to uni i had assumed that pharmacy was kind of a dead course with not-so-high entry results until i realised that you need 4 As to get in. And now that i'm in nus these pharm students are spoiling the bell curve in all the electives I've taken and sometimes even my major modules (I know of 2 pharm students in my major module last semester that had way above average results for CA).

TLDR: pharm students are smart in general but I have no idea what they do under than dispense meds and do they really need a degree for that?

23,"Most of you probably will never see this: a letter of academic dismissal from NUS. 

Most of you probably will never see this: a 1.46 CAP after 4 semesters and 80MCs. 

I eventually graduated with a CAP of 3.19. Nothing to brag about certainly, rather, I hope this post can serve as an encouragement to those who are currently struggling with their CAP and can’t find or see any hope in their situations. Here are a few pointers. 

1. You are not alone! I had attended several help group sessions while in NUS and was stunned to find so many peers who were struggling and had similar CAP as me. There are people going through the same struggle and understand your dilemma, therefore take heart, you are not alone! 

2. Reach out! When you have such an “unglam” CAP, first reaction would be to hole up in your room and keep it a secret. I did that at the start. I didn’t dare to approach my mentor/professors for help because I was afraid that they might “look down” on me and they would know that I am THE “unicorn” in the cohort. Truth is: they deal with such cases more often than you think. It’s common for students to lose their footings in uni as the transition from Poly/JC is so drastic. Again, refer to my first point.  

3. Form a mugging clique! Now this might be tricky, but nonetheless worth a try. Find a group of peers who needs/wants to mug as hard as you. For example, my trick is to always sit in the front row during tutorials and raise questions when I’m in doubt, people from that class will recognise the presence of the “stay hungry, stay foolish” type of person in their mix. Fellow muggers will come to you like moth attracted to fire and you build up friendships from there. 

4. Your CAP matters! (no matter how low it is) I always see people asking questions like: What can I do with a third class? The answer is: plenty. For example, I secured my current job 3 month before the end of my final sem, and that’s after receiving 4 offers in total. My job is not too shabby either; a few hundred bucks above the median pay for my course in an MNC with good benefits. Contrary to popular belief, many employers nowadays don’t use the CVs of low cappers for Origami. They’ll review your results from Y1S1 to Y4S2.If you show marked improvements as the semesters progress, I’d say you stand a good chance. (the exception here is the civil sector, but I wouldn’t say it’s impossible. I eventually did get an interview opportunity with a stat board after a long wait but declined as I’ve already accepted the offer from my current company).  The aim here is not to achieve a certain degree class, but to see continuous improvement to your CAP after each semester. 

So there you have it. There’s hope, there’s opportunity and there’s redemption. 

Now go!

As I had too much time on my hands I actually went to browse the sub mentioned in #49772 and coupled with some experience with girls I feel that it would be interesting to comment on this topic further, probably since no one would dare to publicly show interest in this post (me included)

1) yes you are right men and women are not on the same place on this issue

Girls are surprisingly much pickier than guys despite the typical stereotype that guys are the superficial ones who think with their eyes. (yes #49781 said this already)

In my regular long public transport journeys I take when I was in jc and now, I see girls swipe on dating apps with such speed that if you didn't know better you thought they were playing Fruit Ninja without the threat of bombs. Guys actually swipe at a slower ratebecause they actually stop to give the girl a chance if she doesn't look pretty but looks pleasant and take a look at her profile

Disclaimer: the people described above paragraph applies to only ""average looking people, the type that few would swoon for"" (yes I know you are going to say NPNT) and it does not apply to all of them, it's just generally true, I'm sure you all can relate to it anyway

And the most interesting part is that the girls simply swipe for guys who should not even be on dating apps because based on their looks they already can get a partner irl.

2) I wouldn't agree that it's no fault of their own though

The solution is actually relatively simple if we acknowledge the truth that a vast majority men and women are shallow and superficial in their choice for a partner

To simplify it for guys, to land a chance for a girlfriend, all you need to do (that you can achieve if you try hard enough) is

a) look good (muscles, acne, hair, clothes, whatever you think works, anyone with a brain probably knows already) 
b) have social skills/charisma/confidence/alpha/redpill stuff. When in doubt of whether to be more aggressive/polite, always choose the former
c) have a good personality

Just kidding no girl actually cares about politeness (pls be polite to the waiter though) or kindness

Tada. As you can see, the above can be worked on. So it's not through no fault of them

Ps if you are short you just need to work extra hard for the points above, and be prepared to be rejected by 75 percent of girls already

With that said it basically means that if any girl says she has no feelings for you, if you think you aren't v good looking, it's 90 percent the case and she's just being tactful

To be fair

For girls they just need to do 3 things as well

1) not be extremely fat
2) some makeup (situational)
3) have a good personality (not a joke), ok let me rephrase, a fitting personality for the guy you like
4) not be completely flat

Just kidding for the last one, most ""average looking"" guys don't give a shit

3) based on what I read on the sub and the bitter people around me who cannot even have a single tinder match nor get anywhere close to a girl, I don't think reaching out to them is the solution. I noticed that after they have such negative thoughts they become extremely pessimistic and cynical of everything around them. Guys reaching out to guys doesn't really make them feel better because it reinforces their beliefs that girls would never be with them. Nevertheless, the attitude of these unlucky guys becomes quite sour over time and at that poin rightfully no girls would go near them. 

Unless your definition of reaching out is to actually encourage them to improve themselves, otherwise they'll just view you as trying to make them think in a more positive manner, which is quite impossible for them 

Thankfully in Singapore the situation is not so bad that ""incels"" don't have female friends so at least they don't feel so isolated yet

27,"Life is full of unpredictable.

I had so many male friends who I knew before I  entered University, and they ended up with the same course as me. None of them had thought of me of more than merely friend.

Little did I expect this to change until I met my boyfriend during my first semester. He was my tutorial classmate. I didn't really took notice of him until I met him at the lift by luck. He initiated conversation with me and hence, gained my attention.

Initially, I thought that he wanted pure friendship, so I decided to invite him out for lunch after tutorial class. I always thought that he wanted pure friendship even though my male friends told me that it was quite obvious that he liked me.

Eventually, we started to drift apart. When I had reached my last semester in University, he started interacting more with me again. Eventully, he became my boyfriend.

It turned out that he liked me ever since the first semester. After I invited him out for lunch, he misinterpreted the signal and thought that the feeling was mutual which is why he started showing more signs. My male friends was right all along. However, he wasn't 100% sure of the feeling was mutual, hence we drifted apart as he didn't dare to confess and wanted to avoid more disspointment.

During the last semester, he decided that it was a do or die situation, so he decided to try his luck one last time and go all out to chase me.

28,"To #49269, thanks for the encouraging post. I’m a guy, have been using CMB for a few months now, and, at risk of being flamed, have a few observations, responses and thoughts. As a disclaimer, in writing this, I have no intention for this to be a rant. Happy to hear what you/anyone else have to say.

Observations

(1) You are right that it is “tiring”. I don’t always get matches every day. Even when I do match with someone else, some matches keep silent. TBH I really don’t understand why anyone would return a “like” only to keep silent / ghost the other party. 

For new matches, there’s also the part on getting to know the other party. At times, some matches are just inherently incompatible - different values, attitudes, goals. On other occasions, it’s quite clear that they are not sincere in getting to know me better. To be clear, I accept that there may be more attractive peeps out there and there’s really nothing wrong with being superficial, but at least have the courtesy to respond after someone replies to a question you have asked?

(2) On a related note to (1), ghosting is very very common. Some people claim in their profiles that they are looking for “sincere” and “genuine” people - these people return a “like”, (some may or may not talk,) but end up ghosting the other party. Uh okay...

(3) Many people obtained a Bachelor’s degree after attending polytechnic, secondary school, ITE, or JC. Let’s not kid ourselves.

(4) There ARE sincere people around looking for a connection/something serious. I have previously connected with a few - NOT many but they do exist. On the same footing, there are also people who strike an impression that they are just there to accumulate matches for their own personal satisfaction (?).

(5) A few categories of people who are using CMB for absolutely bull crap reasons. Some are there to “make friends only”. Uh what? Using a dating app to find platonic friends?

I also came across other insurance agents’/financial advisors’ profiles. One agent’s profile was particularly striking. She said something to the effect that she wasn’t looking for a relationship, but continued by saying “Or maybe not” (from my vague memory). For avoidance of doubt, she was from a reputable school. I have no respect for such people. It doesn’t matter if you have a pretty face. If you’re there to solicit for business, don’t mislead others. Needless to say, I didn’t like her profile. How to buy insurance from someone who isn’t upfront and honest?

Other thoughts

(6) We are all superficial people. I don’t deny that looks matter. However, when two people match, many times, interest wanes quickly, perhaps probably due in part to the many options available. A more good-looking chap may come along after an average-looking guy matches with a lady. But this begs the question - is there an end to this? And there’s also the chance that the lady may end up being a “victim” to this when a better-looking girl comes by.

When people say that one will bump into the right one when the time comes, when exactly is “the time”?

(7) Casting a wider net - I understand that it’s important to keep an open mind. Just wondering how far people are willing to cast their nets. Would you date a girl/guy from a private uni? Ladies/guys, would you date a younger guy / older lady? What’s the limit?

Personally, I would find it difficult to date someone else with a vastly different education background. At risk of sounding elitist, I think that one’s education reflects something about him/her. I also need to be able to connect on an intellectual level with my better half.

29,"Hello guys, today I wanna share with you my love story. Basically I met my bf 4 years ago and we hit it off quite well, he never officially asked me out but we went out 1-2 times a week. After 6 mths I couldnt take it anymore and asked him if we're together, to which he said yes ur my girlfriend. 

But somehow this left a bad scar on me?? Cos when u tell ur friends/parents that ur attached, they'll be like ohh tell me the details, how did he ask, where etc? And I had to lie and say like I cant really remember how he asked me haha. And some will continue on with ""ohh its okay at least he's the one that asked u out :) ""

While we were dating, he hasnt been the most gentlemanly to me either. Like will force me to pay for meals, pretend to be sleepy, tired so that he wont have to send me back, never answers my calls or even gave a call back, will purposely ""gek his hand into a fist"" when I try to hold hands with him??, when I talk to him, wont reply and wont even give me eye contact, usually I have to shake him and be like hello u got hear what I say? Then he will be like uh yeah. And there was even once I caught him using tinder to ask other girls out, but I'm nt sure if he deleted those chats but he said he never went out with them and I believed him. Basically just the worst boyfriend ever. I complained to my friends so much until they dont even wanna listen anymore and all they can just say is like "" Just break up can anot"". I did try, but like everytime I decided that I'm nv gonna reply him again, theres this small ""what if"" that keeps resounding in my head. and I always end up calling him and making up with him again. 

Fast forward 1 year, we still fight alot, but I realised that actually everything I complained about last time he doesnt do it anymore.

Fast forward to now, we seldom fight already because most of the things I'm uncomfortable with I've ironed out with him in the past. 

I once read this analogy on NUSWhispers, it goes like this "" Love is like u want to drink cold water, I have a cup of water and fan it 1000 times but another guy walks past with ice cubes and u go to him immediately. Sometimes u just cant help it, that u dont have what the other party wants"" 

I used to feel that way about my bf too cos I dont really want a relationship where we do our own stuffs, and share what we feel like sharing. I want a closer relationship like shower each other with concern and at least know what each other is doing. But as I keep complaining, or maybe I should call it ""feedbacking"" He slowly starts to understand me more and in a way becomes more sensitive towards me. Basically not everybody can fit you perfectly like a jigsaw puzzle, sometimes u really just gotta talk it out even if it make you seem petty, but if it makes u feel uncomfortable u should say rather than trying to push ur anger onto something else. 

So recently he just proposed to me I'm 26 and hes 29. Its so hard to believe that I'm marrying this asshole guy from 4 yrs ago. Now hes much nicer to me and everytime I tease him abt how bad he was to me last time he'll just be like ""got meh?"" 

So I just wanna advise my juniors who are struggling to have a little bit of faith and keep talking out ur troubles. Dont give up so easily.

30,"Well, it's my graduating semester, and only now do I have a name to attribute to this annoying mental state I have been experiencing. 

It's unofficially dubbed the ""brain fog"" syndrome, and I believe it has been intermittently affecting me ever since NS (probably nurtured from shutting my mind down during the long field camps), though it has recently gotten worse. The symptoms manifest as an inability to focus and to actually think deeply, so much so that I blurt out or do illogical things because I simply cannot ""think past the fog"". In conversations for example, I usually just listen and not say much, and the words or actions I occasionally blurt out or do respectively are based on my ""instincts"", not on any actual thought processes - I feel like I'm just operating on auto-pilot at times. This has negatively impacted my performance in recent interviews, because I can no longer think before I speak.

I'm not sure if this is from mental fatigue, but it does seem to only come in during stressful periods (such as now, during the exam period). Meanwhile, I observe everyone else behaving normally, and I wish I could be the same as them.

Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this?

No. It’s called being practical. You’re attending school, not a fashion parade. Why would your fashion sense matter? Who knows, they may be fashionistas outside of school. Just look at the rigour of Engineering. Ain’t nobody got time for dressing up. In year 2, I’ve had 4 modules that got labs. So I attend school every single day from 9am to about 6pm. Projects on weekends and shit. Dress up? Fashion sense? Seriously. Got time to sleep very good liao hor.

Crashed an arts camp last year and this freshie said engin girls can’t dress up for nuts. Errr, okay. So I’m a girl from engin and she doesn’t know. But hello my dear, we attend school everyday. Go for labs, which requires covered shoes and long pants, bring our laptops around, carry our equipments and crap, attend school from 9am to 6pm, stay back for projects, yada yada yada. You get the point. That damn girl attends school 3/5 days for less than 5 hours, carry a Mac (few engineers use a Mac cos games and hardware programs give you problems on Mac) in your longchamp handbag, wear dresses and heels and make up. Sureeeee. Wear knee high boots and scarf in Singapore LOL fashion. Mai geh siao. Sibei ho chio.

Yah yah people gonna say I’m salty and triggered but that’s the truth. Fashion sense my ass. Fellow engineers will understand. I’m not insinuating that OP is from Arts.

32,"Today I would like to pen down my confessions and life experiences as a part-time student who struggles to juggle work, studies, life and relationships all at once. 

I came from a less than well to do family and I must admit I'm not exactly a ""smart"" student per se although I had the opportunity to continue my university education after NS. Because of family financial circumstances I had to choose to work after NS to support my family.  

I've always envied at others who has better family circumstances in every way, thereby allowing them to study with the financial support from their parents. You might say ""There's financial aid that you can source for isn't it?"". Well truth be told, I was the only man in my family and I lack the connections, resources, knowledge and guidance to know whats happening around me and what I could do at that time. Everyone was going through the ""normal route"" except me. Thus, I chose the work life to directly tackle my family's financial instability with the intention to further my studies (full-time) after a few years.

A few years down the road after I chose to work, a fellow colleague/senior of mine introduced me to part-time education. After many many talks, discussions and questioning, I took up part-time studies in NUS 3 years ago and thus began the most challenging life decisions I've ever made. 

I remember back then I was scrolling through the once called ""Btech"" department webpage FAQ section. One particular question asked and answered was the commitment one has to give in order to complete the course which lasts 4 years if you followed their recommended schedule. The suggestion was for candidates to be ready for the ""commitment long haul flight"", where one has to strive to balance work/studies/life. But most students prevailed and managed to complete the course. I was pretty confident back then and I told myself ""hey, 4 years will pass by quickly"". 

Fast forward to 2018, here I am in my 3rd year of my studies, absolutely too late to back out now even if I wanted to. Yes, I've contemplated about it several times but decided to hang in there with my fellow classmates who were going through it with me. 

""Ok cut the chase, what your point?""

I'm not trying to intimidate anyone who thinks of pursuing higher education while working, I'm just penning down my sacrifices throughout journey.

Lately I've been feeling under the weather. Worst than usual. Looking back at my past 3 years, I felt like I really missed out in ""life"". 

I hardly have a ""life"" after work because I've to go to school for classes, usually 3 classes per week.
With each class ending between 8.45 to 9.30, I usually only reach home between 10pm to 11pm. On some days, I can only eat dinner when I'm home because my work ends at around 5.45 and I always reach class at 7pm earliest. This is probably the 1st ""daily set-back"" I'm enduring and am still enduring.
Next is my annual leave. 90% of my annual leaves are used for exams/ exam periods. Which means I haven't had proper leave dedicated to my own well-being. On some semesters I've to resort to unpaid leaves as well.
Being able to multi-task and split your commitment between work and studies is also a challenge you must be able to face. Have an urgent task you've to submit tonight but you also have a lab session tonight? Tough luck, make your choice. An important tutorial class tonight but you have to submit that damn report? Tough luck, stay in office and finish that report. Trust me, its an undesirable shitty feeling whenever you've to miss class due to work. Afterall you're paying your own school fees and you know missing out on certain classes is detrimental to your results.

That is just an effect on my personal level due to work/study commitments. There is also the effect on my relationships between my partner and me as well as my family.

With so much time consumed by studies, I find that I hardly have any time for myself, yet alone, my partner or my family. This does not only happen to me, but my peers as well.
Every now and then, there will be disagreements on how we spend lesser time on them and how we've cared less. Yes no doubt they understand the struggle we're going through, but once in a while whining and complaining does happen because the emotional burden outweighs the logical benefit from this degree.

Not forgetting the school fees. It cost roughly 5k per year. When you're paying for your school fees yourself, you'll definitely feel the pinch.
At my age, I've to save enough money to get married, buy a house and prepare for any additional expenses while paying for school.

During your candidature, its of utmost importance that you find yourself trust-able and reliable friends/classmates so that you can count on each other in times of need. Be it exchanging notes, reminding each other of important dates or studying together. Because ONLY when you surround yourself with friends, will you be able to sail through your course. You can't possibly do it alone. I'm thankful of my friends.

If I am not mistaken, my class has shrunk by almost 50 percent from the original hundred over students. Everyone has their own reasons and own sets of struggles. It is sad though, to see some faces disappear the every next semester only to found out that they've chosen to drop out.

""All these struggles will pay off one day."" I know and I'm well aware of it.
I look forward to the day where I can just fully focus on my job (and the pay it brings) and my family. I truly believe it is only then where my life would start. Where I could truly start living my life.

I'm not sure how I'll feel when I receive my paper in the upcoming 1.5 years. But one thing for sure, this is probably the last paper qualification I'm chasing on a part-time basis. It is just too damn tough.

I believe there are others out there who are having it tougher than me. I wish them courage and success in their paths too. My post is not a comparison on who is having it tougher. It is just a post about how I feel.

33,"I am poorer than many people around me -family relatives, friends, neighbours, etc. I am only poorer because i have many richer relatives and friends. I live in a 5-room HDB flat with my own room. I have a smartphone. I have enough money to eat. A bed a to sleep. A table where I study and do my work.


By statistical median income, my household per capita falls below. Not very much below, but still below. My household happens to be the one with too much income to be disqualified from emergency financial aid, but not nearly enough to get by.


Sometimes, in order to alleviate the overwhelming sense of inferiority i get from feeling poor, i buy things. I try to engage in consumerist pleasure. I pretend i can afford things I don't need. I buy books online, from the income i get by working 12 hours shifts in a stinky restaurant.


My mother always reminds me that we are poorer than others. ""buying books are for rich people"" - i agree. I can just borrow from the library (i used to when i was still in pri/sec sch). My mother tells my father he is useless because he doesn't have ambitions and squandered his youth away doing nothing. My brother is  emotionally repressed and doesn't express his thoughts to us. 


To save money, my mother asked me to use toilet paper instead of normal tissue papers because she thinks i am wasteful. We collect garbage furniture, broken chairs, abandoned shelves, newspapers, metal drink cans leftover from parties so that we can recycle it for about $2 every week. 


We are supposed to do it discreetly. No neighbours should know. When we see our neighbours as we lugged our trash to the recycling centre, her face stiffens and she quickly tries to hide her embarassment. I havent been to any other country except singapore.


My mother is so obsessed with saving money that time she went all the way back to a wet market after it closed, just to find the tofu seller who charged her an extra 50 cents. She cries when we tell her to stop taking small sums too seriously. Sometimes it really isnt worth the time or anger or frustration. A huge fight occurs because my dad doesnt use his pioneer card for an extra 3% off. She scolds him severely if he misses out on even 10 cents from bringing his own bag to ntuc. I get afraid of eating too much food from the house because then i would be seen as wasteful. Sometimes i really resent my parents, not for being poor, but for not being able to at least try to be happy while poor. I have so many friends whose families dont have much savings but they are united and close. At least not fighting. I wish my mother would stop despising our status, her job, my father's income, or feel ashamed that we are poor. It is a structural inequality. Not our incompetence or laziness.


I know small sums add up to large, significant amounts. But all the fighting over money is really killing me. The only thing i think of now is money. I was brought up in an environment whereby your head becomes a calculator, calculating prices, costs, how much cheaper it would be. The price tag is the first and only thing i see. 


I am tired. Truly am. I applied for financial aid from nus, but i teach tuition. I have school from tues to fri, teach tuition from sat to mon, waking up at 6 am everyday to go to sch or to work. I pay for my own concession, my own food, my own phone bills. I do the housework every week, from cooking dinners to cleaning toilets, to laundry. Top it all off with 5 shitty modules that my professors dont teach well. 


People around me always keep me a skeptical look when i tell them i am working so many jobs. They are confused why i put myself through so much shit. Ya, maybe it is because i dont get $100 dollar of weekly allowance like you do? They ask me how am i supposed to focus on my studies if i take on so many things. They ask me to join a CCA to enrich my uni life. My CCA are my part time jobs. I try to save money by eating two meals a day. And NUS canteens cannot stop jacking up prices ($houtout to NUS).


Uni is a place for the relatively well off in society. There is no denying it. Tertiary education is a privilege for those who can afford it. One bad experience: I heard one of my groupmates say before that poor people are poor because they are lazy. I wanted to smack that mouth right there and then. But i bit my tongue and kept my mouth shut because bigotry will always be around and i dont want to deal with people like them.


I dont even know what is the point of this confession. Just tearing up in frustration, sadness and anger as i type this, trying to make words out of years of exhaustion, jealousy, confusion, pain and just getting scolded for not being thrifty enough or getting called stingy or cheap. 


Am i alone in this?

36,"Hi. 

I have been reading NUSWhispers for a really long time now, and recently I mustered just enough courage to confess to my crush of 5 years (who is also my really close friend for 8 years) 

We have been really close friends, and have watched movies together (just the 2 of us), we have even travelled together (but stayed in different hotel rooms). I am sure we enjoyed each other’s company. 

I am an average girl who loves to shop and game (I play games on Nintendo consoles and league/dota etc.) I wouldn’t say that I am ugly, I think I look decent. He is someone who loves sports, and taking part in all the different activities. He is constantly also helping his friends (mostly girls) on different tasks (like helping out an event, moving house, painting walls etc.) He isn’t someone that would be considered ‘hot’ with today’s standards, but I find him really attractive. 

Well, I confessed to him and he rejected me on the spot. His reason being? I game. He said that it would make him feel uncomfortable to tell his friends that he is dating a gamer girl, and that he actually find me his type of girl apart from the fact that I game. 

I have told him that I’m willing to be involved in his activities, and cut down on my gaming (which isn’t alot tbh) but he said no, he wanted a girl who doesn’t game. (But he said he is fine with mobile games as he plays them too) 

What should I do? :( Do guys usually don’t find girls who games attractive?

If said guy/girl is interested, chances are there will be an observable reaction (Unless he/she knows what you're up to and fake a reaction/non-reaction). Best part about this is that if you do get a positive, you can use whatever advice he/she gave you back onto him/her to make your intentions obvious. Viola.

39,"I have a story to share.

This story is about me and a girl that I met on Tinder last year around May. She goes by her pen name as she likes to write life quotes on her Instagram. 

During the time when we were dating, everything went very smoothly, we loved and cared for each other, there was like really no arguments between us, everything is just seem very amicable, we even plan and bought tickets for a trip overseas in January even though we just started dating. In addition, I actually wanted to have an official relationship with her but due to some circumstances from her side, I can’t be in a relationship with her.

However, things suddenly fall apart on a particular day, that day was a Sunday, we went for brunch and then to Hort Park for a walk and lastly went to Vivo to walk around before going back. At night, she sent me a whatapps message saying that she had a very important thing to discuss with me, she asked me is it possible if we become friends and go for the overseas trip as friends, but she mentioned she is still in love with me. I was devastated at that moment but kept my calm and assure her that we can be friends but we need to meet up again to sort of put this chapter as a closure. 

During the meet up, she told me the reason that she decided to split this relationship is because she feels a bit choked and feel guilty that she kept rejecting me when I asked her to meet up during our time together. Furthermore, she also said she do not want to be in any official relationship with anyone within this few years. Due to her circumstances, I can understand why she said that even though I know I have compromised a lot during the relationship. For example, there were times she cancel our meet up at the last minute, and I did not even scold her. I just told her it is okay we can meet up again next week or something. This was one of the many things that I have compromised with her. 

Fast forward to after the trip in January (Yes we did went for the trip as friends). A week after the trip, I saw her changed her profile on her tinder. We were still matched on tinder when we were together as she told me she didn’t want to delete it and told me to trust her. That day I was supposed to submit my FYP interim report, after seeing the changes in her profile, I was shivering while I confronted her.  During the confrontation, she told me at first that she was keeping her options open. I was like WHAT!!! doesn’t that mean that she was keeping her options open to find new guys. Then she told me she was keeping her options open to find new friends. I continue to confront her until she ended up blocking me after I said some unpleasant stuff to her because I was really really hurt. After which I sent a lot of emails to apologize to her as she blocked me everywhere even on social media. She sent back some emails but the last email really hurt me the most, when I asked her why is she not thinking about our wonderful relationship in the past and just let the whole relationship end, she said to be honest she did not think about that before and told me that we have to stop everything and to not email her anymore.

After I told my family and my friends of the whole saga, they told me I was stupid enough  to have apologized to her and that she is just making an excuse saying that she is on tinder just to look for friends. After which, I did not sent her any emails anymore and decided it is time to really moved on.

I’m really thankful and grateful to have such loving people around me encouraging me to move on. I’m very sorry that this is a long post, but I just want to share these things to you good people of NUSWhispers. Please feel free to share any opinions you all have. I will read everyone single one of them.

To a.r.l, I am very happy to have met you. I have gained tremendous amount of experience being with you. And tbh, it was really one of the best relationship I ever have although sadly we have to end like that. I wish you good luck in your future endeavors. 

Cheers to all!! And be happy always!!

I'm in a relationship with my boyfriend of 3 years plus but recently I met someone and he shares the same interest as me, gets me even more than my boyfriend and we connect on every level... he is gentlemanly, caring and understanding... although in the looks department he is not as handsome and he is still year 2 but we hit off so well... i do not like the smell of cigarettes and he does not smoke.. while my boyfriend is a heavy smoker... 

Truth to be told i feel like i was settling in my relationship because 4 years back I was fat and ugly.. and my boyfriend was the only guy who showed me attention.. We have a lot of differences that made me feel we are not really compatible.. i held on because i was afraid i could not find anyone else.. despite my boyfriend being unreasonable as hell i would also bear his temper and scoldings because if i break up with him i might not have anybody and the years we have will go down in the drain.. My boyfriend is also working and earning a stable reasonably high income while I'm still studying.. Now meeting someone who seem most suitable for me make me wonder if i'm making the right choice being in this relationship... Just because he was the first guy who wanted me and because of the comfort of the years together.... but honestly i see a future together with this guy i met... i have never felt the way I feel towards a person not even to my boyfriend... I talk to this guy everyday and facetime and skype and hangout frequently... and i think about him very often.. even when I'm with my boyfriend... I never really mentioned about this guy friend i have to my boyfriend and i mute our chat so that his name won't pop up while i'm with my boyfriend... And yes i am ashamed to do this and feel this way.. i have no friends to turn to to ask for advice because my boyfriend is my only friend...I don't have a close relationship with my sisters and parents too... so i hope i can get some advices from here...

I feel like i'm falling into the pit of emotional cheating... although i don't know if he feels the same way towards me, i feel like this feelings is eating me inside out as i think i'm being unfair to my boyfriend... I remember an advice Eunice Annabel gave was to break up with the person..don't cheat... 

My head is really in a mess, i don't know if i should give my relationship another chance... or just break up.... Help...

41,"Hi. Yes you. I don't know where to start, but I guess I'll begin with how you judge me. I like hawker food. I like cheap food. I like affordable food that comes in appropriate portions. I'm thrifty by nature, calculating in my head daily expenses like how much I spend on food and drinks. I don't even drink drinks when I eat. I just drink water. Sometimes I snack and skip lunch because it gives me the thrill of knowing my snacks are cheaper than the inflated Japanese cuisine at techno edge. So yeah I guess you can call me giam siap, because I have loans to pay and need to survive.

Moving on to how I look. I know you like to compare me with the other engin guys silently. I can see why they are better. They are hot, have sharp faces, nice bodies that ooze of the beach bod vibe. Then I look at myself. Hey I'm not like them. Believe me I tried. I really tried. I gym regularly now. I even started my protein powder diet, though sometimes I stop a bit because I cannot stand the sweetness of it, needed to rinse my mouth with water after every intake. I watch my diet also, but sometimes I binge eat because I couldn't control. If I continue like this I think I'll develop some psych illness like the ones in the channel 8 drama. Ok I digressed. Moving on.

How about my results? Not stellar. I know you like comparing me with other friends. Again I tried. You will never know how much I put in to pull up the grades. 

Now sitting in macs typing this, feeling the coolness of the air con, I think it is time to end this. I'll continue to improve myself. I'll keep trying to be a better me, but this time it's not for anyone. This time it's for me. Time to bite into the chocolate pie.

And somehow, i also know that what i cannot UNread on NUSWhispers about giving up seats to pregnant ladies. This will haunt me if i decide i should ever be so unreasonable to ask for a seat for TWO.

Yes. You paid the fares. Yes you are tired. Yes. You have the exact same rights as every other human being on the train to sit down. (except for the elderly, you said)

But what if you are the one who is pregnant? Will you want the seat? 

Ok maybe you are a guy. What if, WHAT IF and God forbids that this should ever happen to precious you: your wife/fiancee/girlfriend is pregnant, your car tyres has just punctured in the middle of the road somehow by the freakish streak of bad luck, there is NO uber or grab cars available, and you and your partner is STARVING. You want to go home really badly. It has been a miserable evening of travel. The MRT/bus stop is close-by. Its about 5 stops to your home station. 


You get up the relatively crowded train/bus (with much ease of movement) , your wife is 6 months pregnant, and her back has been aching with the weight of YOUR newborn hanging from her. She is right in front of the reserved seat. 

The uni kid wearing an NUS shirt decides to look at her straight in the eye, and seeing that she made no request for a seat, continued  to slip into slumber. Your wife looks at you, clearly uncomfortable. She grimaces in pain as the baby kicks her once more.

Will you still remember what you said about your rights, paying the same travel fares as everyone else and their exclusive, private pleasures in the bedroom that you were sadly uninvited to? 

If you stand by your words, grow some guts to wear a pregnancy suit and travel to school for nine months. I will fully respect you with my entire heart if you make it out alive without ever getting a seat on public transport.

44,"Though it seems like some of our local men (yes, you, #47108, you salty bitch) may think that most girls prefer to date angmoh because they are ""better"", I would say not all girls who date angmoh have this stupid mindset. I have a few female friends who are dating/married to angmoh. They are beautiful, career-minded and very independent. In fact, their bf/husband mostly have an average paying job and some are even bald or overweight. They date/marry for love, for their admiration for each other. 

It's true that some of my female friends say they'd wish to date an angmoh because they think they look so hot (omg Chris Hemsworth). It may seem like they are ""better"" than local guys but really, a girl would only have a simple preference when it comes to dating: a preference for good looks and good character. If you let me choose between an ugly misogynistic asian and a sexy chivalrous angmoh, obviously I would choose the angmoh lah. And if you let me choose between a good looking, humble and hardworking asian and a lazy, arrogant and obese angmoh, obviously I would choose the asian lah. And if you let me choose between an angmoh and an asian with similar looks and characteristics, then I would choose the one who is more compatible with me (in terms of values and thinking). It is that simple. Don't blame your failure (to get girls to throw themselves at you) on your skin colour. It's got nothing to do with skin colour. Maybe you are just ugly.

She glanced over when I keyed in ""1993"", then took the clipboard back and said, ""ok that's all.""

I'm evergreen

Throughout the years there are several things I've tried on the girls which I've liked before:

1)Passing her chocolate after class on Valentine's Day
2)Going over to her workplace to pass her a love letter after work.
3)The standard ""texting to know her better""
4) Personally making a bouquet of origami roses and giving it to her
5) Going up directly to her saying: "" Hey I think you're cute. Can I have your number?""

Obviously, none of these have worked (in [5] I did get her number though and was talking for a couple of weeks before finally getting rejected). I felt terrible after every rejection and always took months to get over each one. It has come to the point that I'm completely clueless of what to do. A couple of weeks ago the girl who I currently like asked me out for dinner and I actually rejected that offer despite being available. All the accumulated self-doubt from previous rejections completely overwhelmed my logical thinking.

Perhaps all the methods I've used in the past are wrong, or perhaps I've used them on the wrong people. Regardless, my confidence gets chipped away with each rejection and now I don't even have to guts to accept a dinner offer from the girl I like. FML.

Daring the pair of hands to unlock the seal,

53,"I have 2 adorable cats at home and they’re usually shy, then friendly towards strangers. I brought my boyfriend home to meet my parents last year and my cats had their usual reaction. A little scared but curious about the new comer, and then got used to their presence. My elder brother brought his girlfriend home and my 2 cats also had the same reaction. 

However, my 2 babies were really hostile towards my younger brother’s girlfriend. They hiss and scratch her every time she comes over. It’s been a few months already and the hostility from my cats hasn’t stopped. I personally interacted with my brother’s girlfriend and didn’t have a bad vibe from her. 

I was thinking that she brought something “dirty” into my home which caused the attacks. Because when I came home from Bali a few years ago, I apparently brought something back and my cats were attacking me and something around me. I had a very weird feeling too. Went to pray and you know, the superstitious stuff, and then the attacks stopped. (but that’s a story for another day)

I don’t know how to bring this up to the girl without sounding like a superstitious crazy old lady. But it happened before. My parents are starting to dislike the girl as well because they think that if a usually gentle animal hates you, you are the problem. They said that the cats were attacking her but not around her like my incident in past. I can tell she loves my brother a lot and the feelings are mutual. She doesn’t attack my cat, nor defend herself and goes home with scars every time. 

I don’t know if ppl my age believe in those superstitious stuff, but I think my cats are aggressive not because she’s a bad person. My brother has trouble bringing it up to her, as she’s easily spooked and he doesnt want to scare her. 

I honestly have no clue if it is my cats’ problem, her problem, or the “dirty” stuff problem. I don’t want my parents to disapprove of their relationship just because of my cats. I know it sounds ridiculous, but somehow, my parents trust the cats’ judgement more than themselves.

54,"Upon my girlfriend's request, I would like to share with you all the story of how my first date went. I brought her to a slightly fancy restaurant for dinner. We chatted and joked like normal. Towards the end of our meal,  I asked her if she wants to use the washroom first before we head home. She nodded and went to use the washroom. I seized the opportunity to pay for both our meals. When she came back, I acted like nothing happened. We chatted for another 5 mins or so before I asked, ""So, if it's alright with you, we split the bill half-half..?"" She smiled and replied, ""Okay sure."" I whipped out my phone so I can total up and calculate the average. I also ask how much is hers, then told her how much mine was; calculated the average and showed her the amount. It was close to $40 per person. She took out her wallet, and handed me the amount. That was when I confessed to her that I already paid for the meal. I said sorry for wasting her time and thank her for not objecting to pay. I suggested a bubble milk tea treat to make up for it, before we took the MRT back. 

Now, was this a calculated move? Yes, it was. Because I wanted to see what kind of a person she is. The way we view money as a couple is important. All over the world, money issues plague marriages, and turns ugly in divorce cases. Seeing as how money plays an important role in a happy and successful marriage, my objective was to find out if she came to this first date expecting to pay or not. If she have expectations of paying, my suggestion of splitting the bill half-half won't turn her face black. But why is finding out whether she will pay or not relevant? Because  understand that I am looking for that someone who is willing to pay her share as she wants to soften the impact a fancy dinner will have on her man's wallet. I am looking for a considerate person, a person with empathy. Why? Because assuming a relationship lasts beyond the fancy first date, must the next hundred meals all be fancy too..? At some point in future, we will have meals in hawker centers and fast food outlets because we are saving money for a house or a car etc, or just because it makes economic sense; and fancy dates, while nice, will be limited to special occasions. The point is, I want someone who views money the same way I do. 

Now as a guy, the question is - should you pay for dates? I cannot offer any research-backed answer, but only what I feel to be right. My answer is, if you're looking for a long term partner and you've found the one, and now for some reason she has accepted your offer for a date, and you know deep down you cherish her so much that you are willing to sacrifice your time, effort and money to make her happy and feel loved for years and years to come, because you know she will add so much value to your life in ways that are often intangible to the eyes but tangible to the heart, then paying for that first meal is a way of saying, ""Those sacrifices I will make for you, it starts today...""

I am lucky, because from the moment I suggested we split the bill half-half to the moment she handed me the cash, she showed sincerity. In the MRT, just before we said our goodbyes, she said that if there ever was a second date, that it's her turn to treat. That was 4 years ago. Nowadays, I pay for dates during her birthday and Valentine's, she pays for dates during my birthday, we split half-half for anniversary dates and the person that organizes a surprise date treats. By no means did we create rules like this, it is just that over time, things just came to be like this naturally.

But assuming I wasn't so lucky and she seemed offended because I suggested for her to pay her share, well then there is a risk that I won't get a second date. Then again, do I want to be with someone who doesn't view money the same way I do..? What other money issues might we encounter in the future if we became a couple? The question of who pays for dinner dates will be the least of our problems. Is it the husband who has to save money for the house? If we cannot afford a car but she still insists on having one, yet doesn't want to share the cost of it, what do I do? If she likes to travel to exotic places, but I can't afford it, will she leave me? And many many more money issues... Hence, if I wasn't so lucky and I didn't get a second date, at least I know that my $80 to cover the whole dinner was not a waste, and my ""test"" just saved me from a lifetime of pain. 

So why did my girlfriend request me to write this? Because today is Valentine's Day and there will be a lot of first dates. If you feel convinced that my ""test"" worked, today is your chance to give it a try ;) Regardless of whether you did it my way or not, a date is an opportunity for guys to make their first sincere gesture to the girl by paying for that meal, because ""love requires sacrifice..."" Happy Valentine's Day..!

55,"My mother grew up in a family that clearly privileges the males in the household disproportionately more. It doesn't help that she only has one male sibling. 

The only male heir was the centre of the entire family. He was the youngest, because they tried several times in hope that they would conceive a son.

She is the eldest sister. And being the eldest in the 60s-70s meant that she had to shoulder a huge portion of the domestic chores, caring for younger siblings, etc. She was her mother's best helper, the one who knew all along the silent hardships and untold sufferings that my grandma kept to herself. 

But my mother, despite all her contributions to the family, was not well-appreciated. 

She never got to eat the drumstick during special occasions. She never got the extra dollars to get new clothes for the year. What extra resources was available in her poor household went to the golden boy. The one who had the right biological composition and genitalia to become the symbol of hope and progress for the family. 

She grew hard under the abuse and indignities of favouritism. She knew that it was unfair her and her sisters were doing so much but her brother remained the only one who was praised for tiny steps. 

She even had to fight to pursue her education in diploma. She got it on scholarship, much to the resistance of her parents. 

Even though the diploma education was sponsored, it was not free because it took up two years, and time is money because she could have been working to provide for her brother's education. I am glad she insisted on the diploma for herself. At least she could break out of where she came from and to Singapore. She was most successful amongst her siblings to break out of the poverty trap.

And, when my grandma suffered a stroke, she depleted all her CPF savings (10 years of slogging her guts out) to pay the high cost of hospital treatment and nursing home fees as a PR. 

Fast forward, my mother, now a 50 years old woman is now living a relatively adequate life. Not rich, not even close. But just enough to live without fearing  insufficiency.

Both her children are in university. Intergenerational mobility seems to be looking promising for her. But as her daughter, I see and experience it - the continuity of the ""son privilege"" tradition.

I cannot believe my mother would continue to practise a habit that she suffered so much for. My mother loves my brother very much. It has reached a point she doesn't bother to cover up the bias. I used to beg my father to persuade her to love me a little more but that was ten years ago. 

How does she not understand the importance of treating and loving your children equally? Does she want me to go through the exact same troubles she had when younger? 

When you play favourites with the children, you divide the family inevitably. You estrange your child from yourself and the siblings from each other. In a nuclear family with average one two children, can two siblings afford to be on bad terms? Who will they rely on as they become older? 

Why wouldn't she think of it? This is the part that infuriates me the most - not even the actual favouritism. But the very fact that you have first-hand experience of being the neglected child and yet you CHOSE to let it happen again. 

I love my mother, but maybe because I feel obligated to. I love my mother in a way that is never consistent. How can I be consistent? I get food, shelter, warmth and free home Wi-Fi. 

But I don't have love.  

Oh. And she doesn't keep in much contact with her brother ever since.

Some have questioned whether his technique will work with other types of situations (example, not looking for marriage but want to explore more and be chill about it). So, there are basically 4 different schools of thought: traditional conservative, traditional liberal, contemporary conservative & contemporary liberal. Ben’s approach is a traditional conservative approach which works best if you’re a lecturer who studied at MIT and you’re surrounded by women who look up to you everyday (because of your position).

On top of the above 4 different schools of thought, there is a difference in the region you’re from. America, Europe and Asia. In Asia, we subdivide them into different countries and though in general women want the same things from men, it is the way they want it that is different. Unfortunately, for Singaporean women, they are the most difficult in the ladder of attraction and men who want to date Singaporean women need to be a level 7 for them to be constantly successful in dating Singaporean women. I won’t go into all the reasons, but you can see from our falling birth rates, that the situation is tough, especially for Singaporean men.

So, coming back to the situation on paying for the dates: it isn’t so much about paying for the date, but more whether your payment attracts the lady.
1) Some want payment because they want a free meal. If you can constantly pay and they constantly want a free meal, well pay on.
2) some want you to pay because they are deciding if you’re able to afford them and their life styles.
3) some want you to pay because it shows confidence
4) some just don’t want you to pay because they don’t want to be subverted under your command which once you pay, they owe you one and this annoys them
So just in case you’re confused already let me just break it down for you simply… the key is when you’re going on a date, confidently ask: “hey, I can pay for your date, but just in case you’re the type who don’t like men to pamper you, what would you prefer?” That’s the way to make them smile and laugh and make them tell you what’s going to be a good choice to pick.

57,"Since someone gave a China perspective, let me give another one, on the ""who pays"" thing. I am exchange student from Japan

Guys should definitely pay because the girl does not earn money. It shows that the guy is able to provide stable relationship and finance.

After marriage, the girl should quit her job as soon as she has kids to raise them well. Guys like girls with good child-bearing hips and female skills like cooking or housework. 

The guy's role is to provide for both of them while the girl manages the household or takes care of the kids/elderly. I think this is quite gentlemanly and divides the roles between guy and girl well.

In Japan, it is okay to live with parents because house is expensive, at least for first few years. 

If she wants though, the girl can contribute to the finances by taking up part-time job / アルバイト, though it should definitely be the guy who pays or provides for the family！

58,"I've had this burning question for years. Why are some women (who actually want to be in rs) in their twenties still evergreen?

One of my friends is 24 years old and still evergreen. She often tells me about her crush and how she's trying to get closer to him. In fact, all along she's always been the one who has crushes on guys and no guy has ever chased her. 

It's not like she is ugly or has a nasty personality. In fact, she is quite pleasant looking, kind, friendly, extroverted, bubbly, has a healthy social life, does volunteering work regularly. Whenever she tells me about her life, I would often be at a loss for words as I find it really unbelievable that no one has ever chased her or expressed an interest in her.

On the other hand, I got this bitchy friend about the same age, constantly changing bf. There was a period of time she was single, she had 5 admirers and had to decide who to reject. She was even feeling troubled over having to hurt the guys she rejected. I wouldn't say she's very pretty but she has decent fashion sense and makeup skills. However, she's mean, sarcastic, blunt, fussy, acts like an entitled princess, doesn't have many friends, likes to bitch about people. Even though she's such a bitch, she's happily attached to a very eligible guy. 

Does it mean that girls have to be a badass to attract guys? I really wish to help my evergreen friend. I often had to avoid talking about my bf whenever we hang out. Why nice girls like her still evergreen? What is the problem?

59,"With the recent the whole men-women-dating-pay-meals saga, as a rather dominant alpha male with hordes of dating experience and seeing a really nice lady at the moment (with the intention of marriage).

First and foremost, there is absolutely no hard and fast rules. Dating is simply a transaction that you hope your investment bear fruits. On some days I pay, on other days I get nice gifts and gestures and priceless moments and efforts that money simply cannot buy (a DIY card, a random back-hug, my favorite chocolate bar in her small sling purse). She buys my favorite smoothie and pays for ice-cream. The lists GOES ON.

Secondly, yes for goodness sake women do you really feel we live in a unliberated, male focused society. Yes, I would want my daughter to be able to hold her own and buy her own meals. But at the same time I want a nice gentleman who could hold his own as well and treat her like a princess that she is.

Thirdly, in the wide pool of fishes (all genders), what's a better way to signal a sign of strength and confidence to buy a meal for the lady/men you fancy chasing. But of course coupled with confidence and an intellectual conversation.

Forth, if he offers to pay on a first date. From my experience, We're all filtering out the gold diggers. Make the offer to go dutch ladies, we would still insist on paying! Paying 50-100 dollars to weed out the gold diggers sounds like a good offer eh? (Oops did I broke the bro code)

Lastly, the moment someone starts overmeasuring individual efforts and costs is the day the relationship goes downhill. (I would know because I've been there)

To all the gentlemen out there, don't be deterred by the naysayers and comments. BL made good points in every sentence. Blunt but nothing the the raw truth. If you can't handle it, too bad. And stop bringing in swinging statements like, ""In the 21st century why are we still yadadadada....."" Staph, furreal bru. STOP, dont make the rest of the 90% look bad. We still wanna treat a lady right JUST because she deserves to.

To the ladies, chill. We know your capabilities. Being able to hold your own is an attraction on its own. Let the men be nice for once or twice. It ain't about feminism or whatever 21st century bs we're into. Dont let chivalry die.

And to the Kingsman fans, ""Manners Maketh Man""

PS. It would be nice if this got posted. Could help all those confused lads who still want to treat a lady right

If one day your own daughter is dating someone and considering marriage, would you feel more assured when the guy offers to pay for meals and dates? Or would you feel better for your daughter knowing that the guy is keeping tabs on who should pay? 

What that prof bl is saying is exactly how the world works. While it is ok that sometimes couple share costs before marriage, but it is surely a telling sign that if the guy is already so calculative before marriage, what more after marriage? Yes. People can argue that not all guys are like that. Don't talk abt equal or not lah. That is a silly argument. Just think if your own daughter is in such a situation, are you still going to scream for equal rights and that the girl must pay for the dates on equal basis? If you say yes, please dont bullshit and pretend lah.

He is from a wealthier background but it has always been a source of pride for me that I can fend for myself. My boyfriend and I recently went on a trip overseas and I tried to split things evenly. My boyfriend had free flight vouchers and refused to let me compensate him for the tickets. I felt a bit bad about this and may have been overzealous about picking up the tab during the trip.

65,"Let me share my true story that has been hidden in my heart. 

Before I met my special person, I was a lazy jerk who couldn’t care much about people.  I bear deep hatred towards my Pa for leaving the family and was rude and ungrateful toward my Ma who was always there for me. I was a unfilial son. I would do the minimum of what is required and rant about what I didn’t achieve due to my laziness. However, I will pretend to be the most hardworking, kindest filial son in the presences of other people.

When I first met her, I wouldn’t have imagined that I would become so deeply in love with her. She wasn’t the prettiest or smartest. In fact she was full of imperfections and most guys will deem her as unladylike. However, she is super optimistic and is very self motivated. She brings joy to everyone around her. I fell in love with her within the first few months of interactions.

I started to try and find out about the type of guys that she like without being too obvious. She like decisive alpha males who are very self motivated and consistently making self improvements. Someone is responsible and takes care of his family. The more I find out about her ideal type, the more I feel like a trash especially when she express how much she despises those unfilial piety. I was slowly influenced by her beliefs. I worked hard to build positive traits that she likes and I became nicer to Ma. Life was very fulfilling during this period. Everyone noticed that a positive change in the way I behave. I have never seen Ma smiled So much ever since Pa left. 

Despite spending months trying to change myself, I know really well that I am still not even slightly close to her ideal type. During those months, she got into an under table relationship with one of our common friend. I had only found out when he broke her heart. I regretted so much for not confessing to her before the asshole sweet talk her into *** and all kind of shit. All I could do was to comfort her as a friend. I didn’t confess to her at that time because I presume that it would be taking advantage of her emotional weakness. 

A few months after the situation, this happy go luck silly girl went back to normal state. By then, we were much closer friends and I was more certain that I was not her type. Besides, I am not the type who will sweet talk to girls. However, there was this day, my mind was out of control and my heart just keep prompting me to confess to her no matter how slim the chances were... She politely rejected me by telling me that we are better as friends. Even though that pretty much what I expected, I was still extremely upset.

Months after my confession, I still can’t find someone who can replace her in my heart. I have so much to tell her but I am no longer in the position to talk to her comfortably. That is why I am sharing this here.

By the way, I have purposely mixed in a bit of fictitious details and also omitted some details. This is so that even if you happen to read this, you won’t exactly know if I am talking about you. Perhaps you might even laugh it off as somebody else’s story.

I just want to express my gratitude to you for appearing in my life. It was the first time I ever loved someone enough to prompt me to confess. Thank you for motivating me to change me into a better man who takes care of people. I will continue to work even harder. Also, I pray that you won’t be tricked by those sweet talkers again and find your ideal partner in the near future.

66,"#45905 I am in fact, gay, and well aware that gay and straight ppl have their ""types"" and standards. I do not necessarily want to get in bed with everyone who has the same genitalia as me. 

What I was trying to work through in #45887 was the connection between having similar interests and mutual attraction. In sec sch and JC, my best friend and I had similar interests, so we hung out a lot. Back then we were not aware that each other were gay. We thought of ourselves as 2 guys who were best friends (just like how any straight or gay boys and girls may have best friends). Yes there was a degree of mutual attraction borne out of our favourite interests and a sliver of romance found in each other, but we just thought it was because we liked each other's company because of similarity in interests. 

Then, there came a time much later and more relatively recently when we inadvertently came out to each other. Along with changed and divergent life circumstances, we broke off. Amongst the reasons for the tension and contradiction were the unsettling realisation that we saw in each other a friend, yet it had been like it was us dating all this time. He dates other guys now. 

Today, we don't talk anymore. But he was my friend! He was always my friend! All the time I knew him, I never considered the prospect of us being romantically engaged. Or was he more than that, that I didn't even know? Our friendship was forged back at a time when we weren't aware of the repercussions of our positionality, characterised by sweetness and innocence; and our friendship came to an end in our early-twenties when the implications of our hitherto tendencies became more apparent. 


The question: can 2 gay boys really just be best friends? What does that even mean?!?!

Other than the usual Matlab, they don't do much coding too. What makes employers think that so long as we are from engineering, we can code? 

I can't code a single thing. I only know the usual if else while arrays do while. If all engineers are supposed to code, then why do we have a course specially for computer science and engineering? We only learnt the most basic C programming and that's it. Please don't think that all of us can do coding. It is really pressurising, and makes many feel like shit.

68,"I'm in a LDR with a girl I've met when she's here for exchange, and the time spent apart is really painful. Thus, we videocall everyday to catch up with each other. I really cherish the time spent videocalling her because I miss her alot. However, I think it's getting a little overboard. She loves texting while I don't. I'm the kind of person who only texts when needed or when there's something to say. I don't like texting simple stuffs like ""I'm going to shower now/I'm going down to buy some food"". She, on the other hand, tells everything that happens to her from the minute she wakes up till she hits the bed.

Okay I'll admit that she's getting a little annoying. She expects me to reply to her within 15 minutes of her text unless I'm driving or I'm in a class. She will get really really angry if I don't reply her in 15 minutes and start spam calling me. Sometimes it's really really annoying when I'm trying to enjoy a dinner with my friends without touching my phone and she spam calls me till I have to answer it. Then comes a barrage of questions about my whereabouts and why haven't i texted her. She tells me she trusts me that I'm not with another girl, but she gets angry because ""I prioritise my time with my friends over her"", and that ""I always have my phone with me, but I choose to ignore her""(truth). I have gone through countless arguments over this issue and I'm just tired. This problem only started when she flew back to her country. Maybe the physical distance is making her insecure about my love for her. And that she wants to know what I'm doing 24/7. I have nothing to hide but I feel like I can't live my life like I did before she came into my life. Compromising would mean that I have to answer calls when I'm in the gym, texting her when I'm having family time, updating her every time I step out of my house. Should I just call an end to this? Or will things change when she's back here to work?(She's secured a job here in Singapore)

70,"I met my girlfriend through a dating app and we’ve been together for 5 months. Our personality matches, we share numerous similarities, we can communicate easily, and she’s a really nice person. Logically, we are very compatible.

Initially I was pretty excited when we first started talking and going on dates, but the feeling of excitement has dwindled since a few months back. I have never had those “I love you” feelings from the start. I don’t miss her when I don’t see her and don’t think of her constantly (and feel as though I’m thinking of her less?). A few months ago, I started to think that it’d be better if we could meet less so I have time for my own commitments (eg studying, co-curricular stuff, internships, lab). 

I also started to think about how different it’d be like If I were seeing another person - Have I missed the forest for the trees when I started using the dating app? Could there be someone more compatible than my current girlfriend? Should I’ve given myself more opportunities to get to know more girls better before making a move?

However, I continued to arrange for dates because it felt like it was the right thing to do.

Have I made a mistake? 

On one hand, I’m doubtful whether I can find someone else so similar, and someone who is not only similar in many respects but also has romantic feelings for me.

On the other hand, it feels like I’m fine with being by myself for now. I also wonder if I may have jumped into a relationship too quickly. Should I have taken the time to look around more and interact more with girls before settling for one? Don’t get me wrong - I am no Casanova. Conversely, I seldom interact particularly much with girls, partly because I was from an all boys school for several years, my slightly introverted personality, and also given the nature of my current course. 

At the same time, I know that any decision to discontinue this relationship would bring me to the point of no return - there’s no turning back if I do eventually realise that she may well be the most suitable person for me. But, isn’t hindsight 20/20?

I also don’t want to hurt her and lead her on simply because it is not right and not fair to her.

Any constructive advice is greatly appreciated.

78,"I am here to recount the most bizarre “inspirational” story for all of you juniors out there. I turned my life around and emerged successful ever since I began a truly weird habit. I did not ever expect anything good to come out of this, but may my story inspire and empower all of you. 

Empower yourself. Show yourself love. Really. You can’t control whether other people love you, but please remember to love yourself! 

I used to be unhappy. Nobody called me names or scolded me, but i was not popular either. I didn’t have many friends and my results were bad. My parents were overbearing tiger mum sort and they stressed me out and controlled everything in my life. I had no one to confide in, I felt so alone and depressed. 

One day, I became bold. I took a detour to the nearest mama shop to buy chocolates and snacks. I hid the money in my shorts pocket which was not easy to notice. I devoured about 500 extra calories that day on my own accord. 

And soon, binge overeating(is that what’s it’s called?) became my daily ritual. As I took each bite, I reminded myself that I am here to control my life and treat myself well. I can’t control how the people around me treat me, I can’t control whether other people love me, but hey, here’s something I can control — how much I feed myself. Even if there’s no love in my life, even if people don’t care about me, at least I have one person— me— to nourish myself. That became my personal motto and I feel this sense of conviction and self empowerment with each binge episode which fed me an extra 1000 calories a day. 

Strangely enough, ever since my weight ballooned by 7 kg in a short period of time, good things started happening one after another. With my positive vibes (“I can always show myself some love by eating”), I started gaining more and more friends. That year, I received 16 birthday presents from my class, my Cca and my outside friends. Yeah, 16.  It was absolutely amazing. I am still in awe as to how positive thinking can change a person. 

As if that wasn’t good enough, I was subsequently selected to be a student councillor for the first time, seeing how my positive vibes rubbed off on others and people started getting attracted to my positive vibes (which strangely came from binge eating!) 

You think that’s all? No! After I continued gaining another 2 kg from continuing to inhale bags upon bags of food, I got into the top performers academic programme. Wow. Just.......wow. 

I have never looked back since. From a friendless person, to a student councillor who receives tons of birthday presents. From an underperforming student, to a high flyer. Positive vibes, come on. I gave myself all the happiness and love I craved by shoving food down. Food is indeed my Friend. And yes, when you are showered with love and happiness, (even if it comes from yourself), everything in your life goes up, up, up. 

That’s my unconventional inspirational story. And I’m 10kg heavier now. Every bit of flesh on my body is drenched with love and positive vibes.

80,"I am the OP of #44777 post. In response to a reply to the post: 
You are right that having straight Bs for the first semester/year was a sign for me to be realistic, hence, in my first year, I thought that I would have to stick with a second lower for the rest of my uni life. However, as I took higher level modules (2k/3k/4k) modules from year 2 onwards, I started to get better grades and by year 3, I saw more grades from B+ onwards. In fact, I tend to fare better for the 3k/4k modules. I am in the second upper class now, but the many Bs I didn't S/U during my first year is pulling me back from being in the 'safer' range of second upper i.e. 4.25 onwards. 

I am trying to say that the many Bs you get for the first year may not be reflective of the grades you get for the rest of your uni life. For my case, there are many factors. First - hard work; second - as I complete more assignments, I know better how to do well ""the uni-style""; third - choosing modules wisely; fourth - luck. 

Hence, freshies, please don't be too disheartened if you attain a list of Bs for your first semester. I am not trying to paint a rosy picture here but rather, encouraging you to try your best and learn from your mistakes. Things will come naturally. (:

P.S.: I am from FASS, if that helps!

81,"I recently met a girl through online gaming and I fell really hard for her. I think she kinda did too. We’ve been playing dota, overwatch, WoW, etc, together for about 4 months now. I asked her for a date and intend to confess my feelings for her. She dodged the subject for a few times and I asked her if it was because she’s attached. She said no, but she thinks I wouldn’t like her in person. I reassured her I wouldn’t because she’s really nice online. 

She’s from NUS too and we agreed to meet after her final paper. But now, I’m so disgusted at myself for being a pig. I finally met her, but she was far from what I expected her to be. My image of her was kinda shattered and I didn’t pay much attention to her during our date. I was in shock or something, I don’t know. She obviously noticed and she ended our date immediately after dinner.

I couldn’t bring myself to go online for a few days. I’m really ashamed of myself. Today, she texted me “I told you that you wouldn’t like me once you see me. I was right. I know I don’t exactly look flattering. I’m sorry.”

Afterwards, I couldn’t find her online. I think she blocked my number and cut off whatever means I had of contacting her. I’ve never felt guilt this way before. Why is she even sorry when I’m the terrible person here? It feels like she must have experienced this a lot. 

To YM, I’m sorry for hurting you like this, I’ve sent so many apologies via whatever means I had. I’m sorry for being a visual animal and didn’t even try to be subtle about it. I liked you and I think I still do. I didn’t know what I was thinking, but I’m just sorry. Gaming with you was a pleasure and I’m trying to reach you not only because I want to make it up to you. But I really want to officially ask you out. This is not guilt controlling me, it’s not pity either. Please give me a chance to apologise and you can decide if you’d allow me to make it up to you. I’m sorry for being an asshole.

83,"So there's this charming physics guy I exchanged numbers with in a ge tutorial. Recently he's been texting me about the large hadron collider. BUT he keeps spelling it as the large HARDon collider. He also talks about it like ""the protons pound into each other over and over again with an incredible force ;)"" and ""in the belly of the lhc, you basically have a big hot load of particles released all over the place""

Then earlier today he just asked me if I wanted to go over to his house to check out his particle collider, and that we could also smash (the particles). Gosh, all this talk of his is really making my heart beat. Before this I never knew physics could be so dirty. If he actually just wants me to see his real particle collider at his house I will kill him tho.

There will be frustration, and a lot of us take to our phones, tapping away, hoping that we get some answers as to why we didn’t have a say in things. We will always think of the previous order, how it was better in the past and ask continuously why something like this could be allowed to happen. In any case, I hope that one day my laptop will be able to connect automatically to NUS_STU and stop flitting between eduroam and NUS.

86,"Dear NUSWhispers

I actually graduated from NUS 5 years ago. When I was still in school, I had a lot of expectations and excitement about my relationship and work (that is another story). I used to collect beautiful pictures of wedding gown, wedding decoration on my tumblr when I was in school. I had a lot of fantasy about how my wedding would be like. I also like to see home decoration and I had many ideas in my mind. I had a loving boyfriend who treated me well. He was very encouraging and never once force me to do things I was uncomfortable with. Initially, there weren't many people supportive of our relationship. It had always felt like it was us VS the world. And I always thought that as long as we do it right and love each other, everything would come into place and we would be granted happiness and external bliss. 

Few years down the road, he took very long to find a full time job. There were men in their 30s, who told me they felt that I was wasting my youth away being with him. But I always counter their argument that they weren't much better when they were 25. I mean our local boys will always lose to their foreign counterparts because of the 2 years of NS. A Malaysian boy could easily get their PR with 2 years of work experience and a degree. Many employers I have seen would rather hire someone with 2 years of experience than a complete fresh grad. My boyfriend only needed this one full time job to gain experience and he would be good. I still had a lot of faith in him then. My manager had told me his story with his ex-girlfriend. How she left him because her mother said he wasn't good enough. I don't want to be in one of those typical break-up story. It was still us VS the world. 

Never would I have expected things to turn into conflict between him and I. We saw a good BTO location one day and we happily bid for it! And we even had a good number. I was so excited that I told my whole office. But he broke down and cried saying that it was too expensive for us. He did not have a secured full time job. He told me that my tumblr wedding post and my excitement about wedding and house were giving him a lot of pressure. He even told me he did not love me anymore. How we were becoming monotonous and doing the same old shit again and again. And that was the last straw. I cried for many days. I needed someone to talk to. Anyone who will listen. I was in a phase of life all my girlfriends had their own boyfriend and their own lives and it was really difficult to meet up. But I do know people from volunteering and my old work place. So I shared my story... poured my heart out. And I almost wanted to walk out of this relationship with someone else.

My boyfriend cried and told me that it was a set up for me to walk away because I deserve better. But he just found a new job and he hoped that I can forgive him and go back to how it used to. I have never seen him cried before. It had always been me who cried when things head south. His parents even have to talk to us about how novelty of a relationship will be gone in time. We should treasure because not every relationship can last this long. And not every couple can see each other grow up. But things were just never the same. I always get reminded that I am boring now after what had happened. Many of my friends who started a relationship a lot later than me are already married. Some even with children. And we are still stuck here. 

Is this what adulthood is like? 
You look at one person and all sorts of emotions stir you up and you feel it in every pores of your body. Happiness, anger, fear, hopelessness, anticipation, disappointment... I felt everything in this relationship. This is when your life experience taught you that ""till death do us apart"" is not just about your wedding dress and diamond ring... Do you still want to be together after all that had happened? 

Sometimes I really hope that my boyfriend can do something sweet to bring back how it felt like in the past. Bring me to some fancy place in our best attire or give me a fancy proposal as a reward for everything I had gone through. He still couldn't get it about what I want. If I had to teach you what I want... then I might as well just do it myself? Go book for a fancy restaurant, buy my own diamond ring and propose to myself. I waited too long and I really feel like walking out now.

89,"I'm the OP of 40002 https://www.NUSWhispers.com/confession/40002

To the comment(s) that this sounds dubious: yes this doesn't necessarily happen all the time. But it's possible. AMA & I'll respond. 

1. It's not uncommon to have a large stock portfolio from your offer because if you join a company early, pre IPO or pre M&A, the value can go from nothing to 200k in 2 years or 6 months. There's an entire website & database of tech companies where you can filter by funding rounds and founding date. If you don't know that exists, you haven't done your homework. It's a common website. Also, top VC lists job openings on companies they fund. 

2. My colleague worked as a high school teacher for 7 years, went to coding school and now works as a junior developer. You want any job in the US, you just need to be able to do it. Even if your degree was in Culinary Arts but you have a great UX portfolio. Don't think the whole world works like Singapore where your major is everything. 

3. And by never stop trying, I mean learn everyday, take Coursera, Udemy courses. Build a portfolio. Learn whatever skills you need for whatever job you want and apply for a year to 1000 job postings and pray that 10 will give you an internship or interview or even talk to you. Then try to pass just ONE. And then pray again the one you passed is a good job, not a shit one. 

4. Learn to write GREAT cover letters in less than 150 words. Get a LinkedIn Premium account. For job applications you already want, send the recruiter a sample/portfolio of your work for that industry or product. Network in groups, ask for referrals and introductions. My cold mail on LinkedIn got me Skype interviews because I write TERRIFIC cover letters. That comes with job experience of course to know what a role/company is looking to solve. 

Once I downloaded a data set in that vertical/industry and sent my analysis to the recruiter, without being asked to. I didn't even get an interview. This happened a lot. They already filled the position. So a lot of shit happens all the time too. 

It's dubious if all you do is blast send a resume and cover letter to job applications, fail, and just accept the best offer you got. End of story. 

It's hard to have a vision of where you're heading or when you're ever going to succeed. But do something that betters yourself everyday, improve everyday and you will eventually get there somehow.

90,"As a part time undergraduate TA, sometimes I feel my efforts are unappreciated. 

I usually spend around 4 hours or more per week just to prepare for a two hour tutorial, trying my best to summarize the lecture, insert some bits of interesting info here and there, and re-explaining things I feel students may have difficulty understanding. After preparing my material, I will try to run through it at least once so that my delivery will be smoother on the day itself. On top of that, I usually spend an additional 1 hour or so a week responding to questions via emails and face to face after tutorial. 

Then when it comes to class, around half the class will pon, and only less than half of the people who attend will actually pay attention. I don't mind people not paying attention as it is an afternoon class and students' attention spans may be shorter then, but this leads to my next point.

It is disheartening reading my teaching evaluation report. Although I got a decent score which is very slightly above faculty and department average, I see comments ranging from calling me 'unprepared', 'dumb' and 'too young to teach'. Some even blame me for their bad exam results. Since I roughly remember the mid term results of my class, those who made such comments are either the ones which have <20% attendance or who don't pay attention and are better off not attending. 

Although these comments are minority (less than 5 out of a class of around 30), and although I feel I did a good job, sometimes such comments make me doubt myself. Furthermore, I can't help but think if such sentiments are echoed by the rest of the class, but they are either too polite or too lazy to write it (I always do that).

If the comments are constructive I will more than appreciate them, but comments like that do not tell me how to improve. How am I supposed to act on them? 

On the other hand, I have another friend who is a tutor who is very chill, just barely goes through the questions and wraps up a 2 hour session in around 30-40 mins. Despite his evaluation score being around the same as mine, he does not get such comments and in fact, gets a lot of praise for being a 'chill' tutor, and 'able to relate to students'. Wtf? 

Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy teaching and preparing for classes and I hope to be an educator someday, be it in NUS or elsewhere. In fact, I have just accepted an invitation to help TA another module next sem.

I just hope that students will see their TAs as humans too, appreciate them for their efforts and not be so mean :(

91,"Hi all,
I am a quite down-to-earth fresh grad from NUS (guy) and I have a girlfriend who is quite materialistic (eg. want nice clothes, bag, shoes, big condo etc). I really love her and I understand that different people have different flaw and I am willing to accept her for who she is. Hence, I am trying my best to accommodate her wants whenever possible.

An interesting conversation happened recently and I hope to seek genuine advice. We are planning for our future together and she told me that she definitely want a luxury car in future (BMW, mercedes, Audi etc ). I told her that a car is a depreciating asset and given the high COE price, I feel we should just get an ordinary car (Honda, Toyota) because the primary function of a car is for convenience and transport. When I said these, she became upset instantly. I tried to convince her that the prestige and status of a luxury car is superficial and we can spend the money better to areas such as our child education, insurance or even retirement fund etc. 

Instead of being convinced by my points, she countered my argument with a very tricky answer. She said that she want a luxury car not because of the prestige or status but rather its safety. Then she started to talk about how dangerous it is to drive on the road, how she care about me and our future kid's life etc. She denied that she want a luxury car to show off. She just value our lives alot because she love me. Luxury cars have better safety mechanics and the steel used is strong (ie. wont be less crushed even if get into an accident). She said my life is priceless and she wants to buy a luxury car to protect us from traffic accident and hence the money is worth spending.

Given that I have known her for so long, I am pretty confident (99% confidence interval) that she just want a luxury car to show off but know that it is wrong. Hence, she is reframing in such a way that she cares more about my life.

My best attempt to counter her is that I told her ""then you should get a tank right? it's the safest."" However, given that she knows that we definitely cannot get a tank, she just play along and said ""yes i will get it if it is on sale because it is so safe."" I am dam sure she won't get it even tanks are really available for sale but I cannot prove it. 

I really feel that in the current society, people start to condone materialism more and more. Hence, it is not viable for luxury car companies to market their cars solely based on prestige and status. Hence, they are coming up with a new tactic called safety to jack up the price of their car. 

But anyway, hope that some smart people can give me some advice on how to resolve this issue? Any car guru around? Is it really true that there is no cheap and safe car?

Thanks! :)

92,"I am a fking vain person. I've been wearing makeup since I was 13, even when I go to school. Girls around me would be asking me why I put makeup and saying that I don't have to put makeup and I always thought that they are just jealous cos they don't know how to put makeup. As I grow older I took my vanity to the next level. I got obsessed with plastic surgery and spent all my savings on a few surgeries on my eyes, nose, jaw and braces. I thought it would make me more attractive and I would have more admirers. 

After all these surgeries, I did not have more admirers. My love life was still the same despite all these efforts. Then I met someone online. We didn't know each other's looks and identity. We simply enjoyed talking to each other. 

A few months into chatting online, he asked me out and on our first date I put on full makeup as usual, concealer, foundation, eyeshadow, eyeliner, lipgloss, etc. I thought I looked perfect and the date was indeed perfect. We started dating and our relationship grew stronger as time goes. We grew comfortable with each other and sometimes I would send him selfies of me without makeup. 

Then one day he said something that shocked me, ""You know..I really love your dark eyecircles and your freckles.. you look so much prettier without makeup.. I like you without any makeup.. actually when I first saw you, I did not like the way you look.. but I still want to be with you because during the first few months of chatting online, I really enjoyed talking to you.."" 

It was not my looks that attracted him. He didn't even like my looks when he first met me. It was my personality that attracted him. Eventually I stopped wearing makeup whenever we meet up but he never fails to compliment me on how pretty I look without makeup. He also always tells me how lucky he is to have found someone so caring, understanding and supportive. He said it was my kindness that makes me beautiful.. I'm beautiful when I take care of my loved ones when they fall sick, I'm beautiful when I make an effort to spend quality time with my loved ones, I'm beautiful when I spend hours cooking a nice meal for my loved ones... it is because beauty comes from within.

93,"To the me from 5 years before:

Good Day,

I have graduated, and have been working for a year now. Well, I figured, that if I have things I want to say to you, I will do it here. Why so, even if that does not make any sense? Perhaps, a feeling of sentimentality, a few pieces of regret here and there, and to sow seeds that will grow.

Now, as the older version of you, do believe that I have gone through a bit more than you. I see the mistakes and errs brought forward, that could have been avoided. I wish, that you'd be the me I want you to be.

Firstly, I hope that you'd take off your earpieces. Not just physically, though. 

You see, you have ideas to share with the world, creativity in stock. However, you severely lack the communication skills to express them, and you've dulled your mind by numbing it with those earpieces. There's no ""Hey, if I take off my earpieces, it'll spoil the market when I start using my brain."" 

That, is your ego speaking. You need to learn the difference between Ego, Ignorant Pride, and Pride which you should have.
Though technically, it's true, though. I do like generating ideas in my workplace. It's pretty funny, especially with our childishly playful nature.
Haha, but why restrict your growth, when you can be so much more? You can definitely be more than what I am now.

Well, on the subject of Ego. 
Your textbooks in uni are there for a reason - practice, don't bother trying to understand the thing philosophically, for ""the sake of knowledge"". 
You're training to become an engineer, not a theorist. Practice, and you will understand the mechanisms and logic behind everything. TO put it succinctly, the subject ""1+1=2"" is not simply a definition of value. 

Your Ego will put you on a high horse, for things that are pretty pointless to do. It will also be your ruin, when you're tested during exams, when you refused to acknowledge your mistakes, giving excuses such as ""oh, it's alright, I like spending my time understanding things better"". Such, is the excessive ignorant pride that you have. 

There is no truer statement, than that to know, that you know nothing. To seek advice and help from others, with this knowledge, you will learn a lot, though you still, well, know nothing. Hahas, it's pretty funny if you think about it.

Now, if you'd take off your earpieces, you will have chances, to develop better communication skills. You will be surprised how far a slight improvement of communication skills will go. To know more about others, to do your work better, to be more capable, to be able to talk to, and respected by different people, better communication skills are necessary.

To mend relationships, repair bridges that were broken, and prevent others from leaving you again, you have to take off your earpieces, and start to recognise, the individual in everyone. They aren't simply blocks of obstacles to walk by. They live & breathe, speak & eat just as we do.

You know, we always have that philosophy, that to lead a group of people, to do great things, you must firstly be one of the many. I stand here today, leading my technicians to build my things. I'd say this philosophy holds true. However, I'd appreciate it if I had more knowledge on leading people, because I am severely lacking in such skills. So, again, don't hold yourself back.

Now, on the subject of studying. Don't be lazy. You have to plan for things, and organise your time properly. Don't be whimsical, spending time, going all the way to Arts for a simply cup of coffee, because ""the coffee there is nicer"". 
You'd be surprised at how productive we can be, if we'd just sit down quietly and do our stuff. 
You'd be surprised, at the amount of things that comes out of us simply sitting down there, rooted firmly and doing our work. 
You'd be surprised, that the amount of work that will usually take about a week to finish? Takes only a day or two for us, with the proper planning. And you will feel happy & accomplished, after all that work.

Having told you that planning is important, know that Murphy's Law applies; whatever can go wrong, will go wrong. At such instances, learn to control your temper, and look at things objectively. We have a terribly short fuse, we do. As a result, we tend to rush into things, and crash, & burn terribly as well. Which brings me to the next point.

I hope that you will take the time to pace yourself. Do things that will benefit yourself. Know yourself better, not understand and define yourself. There is a difference, which you might not experience yet. Never go down the road, that says ""more time spent = better yields"". Life doesn't work that way. You'll just be a hard worker, nothing else. Don't be just a hard worker - death marchers have nothing much redeeming. Be smart about doing things, because life isn't like Maplestory - where you can just grind, & grind, & grind.... If you do things the smarter way, it will greatly benefit you, and you'll be a lot less miserable, too, you'll find.

Well, I do suppose it is getting late. I still have a ton of things to say to you, about life, about people, but heh, ain't it pointless putting hope in the past? We're one heck of a genius, you know. We've always been the only ones holding ourselves back, and being all miserable at others about it. That's wrong. Anyways, I shall end here.

Cheers,
The current Lewis.

Always giving me the guidance that I needed, regarding both work and life.

Always correcting me gently, even when I was a slow learner. And showing me the better side of society, restoring my faith in humanity.

Even after my ORD, you would still text me occasionally, asking me how I was doing. 

Its a real shock yesterday, reading news about your accident. I first saw photos of the bike thrashed up on the field.

And when I saw the photo of the bloodied rider in the distance, I prayed hard, that it wasn't you.

But when I saw the close-up of the rider""s face, underneath all that blood, I just knew....I knew that it was you.

95,"So, I have graduated with first class honours, after pulling my CAP slowly for a good 3 semesters from slightly below. Mind you, before you grumble and think that I am bragging, I would like you to know that the 4 years I went through was fraught with ups and downs. Having read many posts on NUSWhispers, I have the following advice (all of which I have experienced at one point or another in my 4 years in NUS), which I think if you follow through everything, you should be able to find happiness when you hit graduation.

1) To those who have not applied for university: don't choose your course just because you want to earn your huge pot of gold upon graduation. You are not the first to enrol, neither will you be the last. You will have to compete, and you will never know how well you will fare till you really strike it out. But you can be reassured that your course will be challenging, and will really push your limits. Choose a course that you have interest in, and push really hard without losing steam. 

2) For those who are about to matriculate: meet people, as many as you can, and spread out your network. The more people you know, the more information you get your hands on, and fast. Then again, if you don't get into camps, that does not mean you are going into 4 years without a single friend. Trust me, when you start doing projects, go on overseas CIP or exchange, or even go on industrial attachement you will gain friends too. 

3) For those who have matriculated: Grades are important, but they are not the only goal of life. Don't just take all the modules that will get you your As and A+s; go take something that would broaden your horizons. Taking the risks to try some other things can open new opportunities that might pull you into a direction that you have never previously thought of. 

4) For those who are lonely and want to get into a relationship: don't be desporate. be calm, keep cool and be yourself. if you see a good person, be prepared to put in the effort, and be mentally prepared if it doesn't get reciprocated. At the end of the day, being single can have its own benefits: if you don't believe me go Google about it, and you should find plenty of information.

5) For those who are poor, are struggling and come from humble background: don't compare with others when it comes to opportunities. For every thing that you groan about, there is always someone worse off in this society. After all, not every Singaporean gets to go for a university education. Stay focused on the ultimate goal of getting your education done, and do your budgeting diligently. It is perfectly OK if you don't get to go on exchange, because while many people gets the chance to exchange, my experience tells me that few actually used the time wisely enough to further their chances of working or studying overseas. If you still think that you want to go on exchange, consider cheaper destinations like Asia and Eastern Europe, and start saving early. For those considering working part-time, do so if you can, but always tell youself that studies and personal development comes first. Take a loan if you need to - when you get a good job this will straighten itself out. 

6) For those who are simply lost: remember that it is OK to wander a little. You may have studied for hours on end to pull your CAP, but don't give up when you don't see your efforts translating into success. For those who are contemplating changing your course, don't ask others whether you should do it - just ask about the procedure from your department office, talk to a faculty member about the decision, and take up modules in the course you would wish to turn to. It may take 1 or 2 semester extra, but if your new course turns out to be where you belong you will probably never regret. There is no need to seek validation from others for all that you do, because you are the only one who can chart your path.

7) To my fellow graduating mates who are currently still unemployed: don't despair and keep your options open. Reflect on the job search process, and exercise the due diligence of researching on every company, memorising and practicing your answers to the dreaded behavioral questions, and checking and updating your resume and cover letters. Internships and training programmes should also be considered too, and it's OK if it is temporary - after all, people do change jobs. The entire process is unpredictable in a way that you can't entirely foresee how employers would think, but honesty is always the best policy. Worrying does not solve problems, but perseverance in asking for opinions and help does. Don't see a change in industry as a waste of 4 years of studying an unrelated subject - there are always transferable skills that you can talk about.

Thanks for reading so far, and may all readers find happiness.

96,"OK, you guys want some real advice what you should do with that B+? Sit down and listen. I'm getting tired of the usual lousy advice being thrown about like ""oh if you s/u too much, then your cap will fluctuate more"" or ""B+ will hedge your cap, makes it stable"" or ""afterwards later years very hard to pull up cap"" or some very nebulous sounding concept that people feel sounds right but doesn't help in decision-making, and particularly the former is a big example of short-sightedness. Who cares if it fluctuates more, man? At the end of the day your cap is cumulative!

I've picked the best example to explain this carefully:

Exhibit A: The hypothetical guy who, by s/uing 3 B+s, manages to save his sorry ass from being pushed down into second upper in the final sem. This guy, would have 148MC worth at 4.5 CAP. Now, had he NOT exercised any S/U, he would have ended up with (.9*148+0.8*12)/160 = 4.4625 CAP. You see how insignificant this difference of ~0.03 is? By hovering at 4.5, this guy is seeing a B+ for every A. This guy is very used to seeing a B+. B+ scared what? B+ is not the end of the world, dude. This guy would and should be way more worried about getting grades WORSE than a B+, considering the fact that B+ is common AF for him. This means he's not an ultra genius who can confidently get 100% As (no need for this discussion). Therefore, the premise where somehow s/uing those B+ would have made a difference between SU and FC is not really relevant, is it? Don't forget this is the borderline case where s/u would have helped. And I've already shown that this situation is absurd. It cannot make sense unless he can be fucking sure that he will never get below B+. No such thing, man.

So what the hell are S/Us for? They're get-out-of-jail-free cards, to protect you from the B, B-, or ouch, the really evil Cs or Ds. Get one of these when you're so busy blocking B+ and you're so done. GGWP. Hara-kiri. Commit sudoku.

So if you're hovering around below the critical value of 4.4625 and you are delusional in thinking that S/Uing that B+ could possibly push you to 4.5, remember that you're definitely NOT a genius and it is very probable you could get a B somewhere down the road and you will be screwed harder because you chose to waste the s/u on B+. B already is twice as lethal as B+.

As for the free S/Us in first sem, you should use them on B+ because there is no opportunity cost involved (they can't be saved). To accept them means you have an obligation to get an A to pay for it. Don't listen to the noise that is ""well your cap will fluctuate more in later sems if you throw away all your B+"" the simple basic unavoidable fact is that every B+ you get MUST be paired with an A. In this case, I agree this would help a bit. Only in the first sem does s/uing a B+ not expose you to getting hurt badly by a B or worse down the road. And that's the main crux of my argument against s/uing B+s.

TL;DR? If you're smart but got a B+, better keep the B+. If you're stupid, keep the B+ because it's the closest thing to an A you'd ever get.

One more day for you, my dear reader, to reverse any bad decision-making on your part. But of course, you don't have to spend the next day mulling over what you have to S/U if you get an A+.

98,"I know that this is a students' portal for anonymous confessions, but I don't know anywhere else to express my thoughts with the mask of anonymity too. I'm actually an assistant professor, and I've been with NUS over 3 years. This is my first university after I obtained my PhD, and so far things are good - especially the university's focus on research. Besides research, new faculty are expected to teach foundation courses. Honestly I'm not a very good lecturer; so are some of my newer colleagues, but we try our best. When I first arrived, I took students' feedback seriously. There was some improvement in my evaluation score over the new few semesters. However, in every course I teach, there is a significant minority of students who gave comments which are neither constructive nor civilized. I've learnt to ignore them, as my more senior colleagues have advised me.

However, I decided to post here because a breaking point has been reached. I knew a colleague who cried after reading students' comments about her - and some of them are very nasty and even xenophobic. ""Can't understand your accent - pls go back to ****** (country); ""Wear heels so you can look taller""; ""For the sake of your health, lose some weight"".

The majority of NUS students are actually genuinely nice and hospitable to faculty from abroad, but I hope those who made such comments can reflect. Is it right to attack a person instead of her teaching? Students have also called me ""obese"" in their comments before, and I've brushed them away. But do you know that these comments are read by people with feelings? We do feel hurt, even though we try our best to improve our teaching with students' feedback. I implore NUS students to consider their professors' feelings. Thank you.

Alright, Now for part 2 of this romantic comedy guys.

“Cuteness overload”…

*cringe*

Anyway Alvin, is true story, LOL. And no I didn’t get fired by Goodyfeed, I write so good no one will fire me one lah. At most write until on fire lah. You know like the emoticon. And no I’m not the guy who got tagged saying it was him, LOL.

Really lah. If really is him ask him treat you drink lah. 

NO LA JK.

Serious is not him. Don’t bahan him liao la. LOL.

OK, so where was I? Ok, now after the sandwich incident. Right.
 
So after the lesson ended, I keep looking…

Should I go up to her and talk? 

Hmm. 

Well, maybe I should…

End up never talk. Cb sia. Feel like pussy. Dunno sia, I kinda feel she a bit disappointed like that, like I never go up to her. Or maybe I’m just imagining things. Aiya. Singaporeans / Asians in general sometimes got no balls one what. It’s the truth huh.

So a few days passed…I keep thinking about her every day. Oh man, if only I can go on a date with her uh…that would be so nice. She replies me on whatsapp when I text her randomly sometimes. Like we talk about random stuff. But in person, she seems to be not receptive to talking to me leh. Maybe is just my face. LOL ok

Got a few times, I saw her sitting alone at the table eating her sandwich…she keep looking at her phone sia. Never look up. Like serious, not even once. How the heck am I suppose to let her notice me uh. I also quite pussy to go up to her. Aiya. #shyguyproblems lah. Also not like if I don’t talk to her, she won’t see me next semester…like arts fac like that. 

Okay lah, chill lah. If got opportunity talk, then talk lor.

End up last day of semester. Never talk to her at all. Shit sia.

No lah, actually got one night, I remember it was a Friday…like really near the end of the semester…and I was feeling kinda sad that I didn’t get to talk to her in person. Like, does she like me, or what?

I texted her…”Hello!”

2 hours later…Still no reply.

I was so expectant man…like you don’t even know. I almost gave up waiting. 

But then a reply came.

“Oh, sorry, I was in a video call with my mum…she’s overseas”

“Oh, you talk with your parents every week?”

“Yeah, they’re overseas!”

Okay lah, the English not so good one la. Use the what whatsapp short form lah, the emoticons and shit I don’t remember liao. 

But we ended up talking for 1 hour plus, about our interests, what movie she like, her JC lah, what we like, where she live outside of school lah, and stuff. This formed the basis of our talking points for the rest of our friendship…

So after the convo went a bit stale, we said good night to each other, and I slept. 

Machiam some K drama right. Like two people chat on LINE then got the bubble come up, then got the guy and girl smiling while typing on their phone in their rooms. Hehehe. Ya, I felt exactly like that. Sorry lah, I'm a guy who watches a lot of K rom-coms. Maybe kena influenced liao lah.

And boy did I have a good sleep that night!
She never talk to me in school, but who cares? She cares about my interests, that’s something, right?

READING WEEK

So it’s finals exams time…time to buckle down to study.

So she stays in school…and I don’t. So during my study breaks, I’ll chat with her a bit…

And I found out she likes corgis.

Wow, I like corgis too…But really, I’m a cat person. But I’ll roll with it. I like dogs too.

Right….So I sent her a corgi video everyday…sometimes two. And she checks her messages during 1. lunch hour and 2. at the end of every day.

I always kinda expect her messages during that week of studying...like during these two times!

Then she’ll be like omg so cute… hahah… oh wow another corgi… I like that corgi…

But pretty much that's all we talk about. 
Aiya, still need to study mah. You think what, keep talking about dogs meh.

So one night, I went for my exercise…I just started, and she just ended her studying in school. She studied with a few friends. Anyway, her messages felt like she was trying to jio me to study with her. Like, she was giving strong hints in text. But she wasn’t like “Do you want to study with me tmr?”. Ya I know it’s confusing but I don’t know how to put it. 

So, being the super cool dude that I am, I GOT THE HINT. Like if I had some future self hovering above me at that moment, I would give myself such a big slap on the back that I would fall flat on my face.

So, I replied, “do you want me to study with you tmr?” 

“Yes, I don’t mind! *smiley*x2”

Damn, was I happy. 

Slept pretty well that night too.

Okay that’s all for Part 2, guys!

Look out for Part 3: The Study “Date”? Coming soon! 

Gosh I need to stop staying up till 2am typing this shit….

100,"Right, kiddos. I know exam’s over but I have a nice story. Here’s one, of how I met my almost-GF. (Gosh, I hate that. Why not GF, you ask? Long story.)

So, one day, we had a lab. One member was missing. I didn’t bother to check. So, everything was done, we pang gang, lab finish, everyone song song lim kopi. 

No lah, no lim kopi. Just take MRT back home lor.

So that day, I was walking back home from the MRT…when I saw a notification on Whatsapp. It was some girl from my course. Wow. Her profile pic was really nice. LOL. So being the typical guy that I am, I chatted quite a bit. She missed the lab…OK. So we were to include her in the lab report. Ok, fine. We did that. End of story? 

No.

So we call this girl X.

So, who’s X? She’s from overseas, came here to study from young. For the sake of anonymity, we’ll leave it there lah, huh. Otherwise you all stalkers reading this NUSWhispers post gonna search up down left right liao. Just know that I think she’s pretty.

Okay, so this girl over here, I liked to help her with stuff. You know guys like to help girls with stuff one right. Makes us feel like the stronger ones. Hehehe. Okay, enough of digressing. 

So, one day for the second lab, she just parked herself beside me in the computer lab. I was doing my own stuff then like whut, wow. Okay. Some pretty girl just approached me. Aiya, limpeh NS no girl friends one, my JC friends also don’t contact liao, first time got such thing happen leh. I also not say super duper handsome, but I quite OK looking lah, if you want to know *wink*. So song song lor. Got pretty girl sit beside me, got another EC.

Okay la, in retrospect I think the reason why was probably because I helped her with the first lab. So maybe she thought I could help her for the second lab. 

Okay lah, can lah...

So we talked. We talked really well throughout the entire lab. Wow! She even touched my shoulder and laughed. Damn, why so touchy feely one. Then the lab ended, and it became a bit awkward lah, so I left. Sad to say we didn’t have much in common after that, so even if we wanted to chat on whatsapp (I had her number from the first lab), we couldn’t find much stuff other than the lab, to talk about.

One day, fate hit. 

It was nearing the end of the semester, maybe like week 10. She got some presentation and was dolled up quite nicely. Coincidentally we met in the lift. She was holding a sandwich. Well, we walked to the LT, then sit in our separate parts of the LT. Aiya. Wish I can sit with her uh. But sometimes very hard leh. Everyone form clique liao. Later girl and guy who don’t know each other at first sit together people wag their tongue. Walao.

Then later that night, I chatted with her on whatsapp. I ask her don’t eat sandwich, eat proper meal (of course not like that lah, more gentlemanly lah. But you get the point)…and some other stuff. 

Convo went dead in less than 5 minutes and about 10 sentences. OK. Sad. GG.

So next day, I walk in LT from the front door. Only got a few people, so I look up. X suddenly didn’t seem herself, she was really shy and kind of looked down unnaturally like trying to avert gaze. Woww. Okay. 

Then I sit down on the other side of the LT. She pretend to grab something from her bag, then stare at me, smiling, hand on chin, for 3 seconds. 3 full seconds. Her eyes were so freaking bright. At that point I was like, WTF, why like got someone staring at me. Then turns out it was X.
That’s the turning point, and the start of the story. 

I call it.....

101,"I am about to share my personal story on how a wrong step I took made my life now so miserable. This step was about taking on a bonded scholarship before I started my university life in NUS.

Like many other students who have just completed their A levels, I began applying for university placings and scholarships too. The young me then thought: a scholarship will provide for my tuition fees, monthly allowances and even sponsor for overseas programs! How nice! So I applied for many scholarships and ended up accepting one from a stat board for a particular course.

When I started school, I quickly realised the course I had previously chosen wasn't my cup of tea. I applied to change my course and was lucky enough to get accepted into the course I wanted. The scholarship provider also agreed since the new course was applicable to their organisation scope too. At this point in time, I was still new and did not think much of the scholarship terms.

During my 4 years in NUS, I admit I have thoroughly enjoyed my studies. I got together with an amazing girl who was supportive, kind and literally someone who I could confide in very naturally. She was fun to be around with, comforting when I'm down, supportive when I'm stressed and loving at all times. However, as the years passed, the scholarship terms was creeping up at the back of my mind, yet I did not address it, choosing to delay it.

Don't get me wrong. I am very appreciative of the money I have received so far, the internship opportunities etc. It has allowed me to go for overseas programs without any financial worries. But now as I officially completed my 4 years of education and about to enter the bonded terms, I can't help to feel miserable.

Why miserable you might think. In the 4 years, I realised what I am interested in isn't really what the organisation is doing. The foolish me back then was too short sighted, focusing more on the monetary gains. If I could turn back the clock, I would definitely have not accepted it. While I am able to enjoy employment now, my heart is heavy everytime I wake up. There is no motivation, drive or passion for my work. I can't help but feel envy at my friends who are receiving lower salaries but enjoying their jobs, jobs that I would have enjoyed too even if it pays less.

My bond is 4 years long with a value in the low 6 digits. I calculated that if I were to break the bond, my effective loss will be around 30k. I did not touch a single cent of the allowance as I tutored while studying which provided me with income. Other expenses like school fees and overseas program fees are incurred regardless of whether I am on a scholarship or not. The loss is mainly due to the compounded interest charged. My plan now is to start work for them but to reassess my strategies and long term plan. Perhaps I will work for 6 months to a year before deciding, so the income earned can be used as a buffer.

Because of this scholarship I have enjoyed many things. Yet I have missed out so much more. Really feel like crying at times.

102,"Some of us might have encountered this situation on the mrt before so I would like to seek some opinions on how you guys dealt with this.

People living in the east might know that a lot of people take the train from Tampines/Simei towards Pasir Ris during peak hours to get a seat and I am one of them. So a few days ago I did the same. At Pasir Ris, there were only reserved seats left. A girl boarded and sat down next to me. She looked about my age and was dressed for work so I assumed she is probably a fresh grad or working not long. So anyway she was carrying quite a few items including a folder and a few small bags. After she sat down, she sniffled a little and tried to sleep. She kept sniffling and I could tell that she was sick.

A few stops later, an old uncle boarded the train and headed straight to the nearest seat which was the reserved seat that the girl was sitting on. He rudely shouted at the girl to wake up, which caused her to bolt awake. She obviously realised that the uncle wanted the seat and she told the uncle softly that she was sick and running a fever and hope to have a short nap before work. But the uncle pretended as if he didn't hear and kicked the girl's shoe. The girl was startled and gave up her seat.

I immediately told the girl to seat at my seat but she rejected softly. She looked like she wanted to bury herself in the ground. So I ended up sitting next to the uncle, who was a pretty disturbing passenger. He kept rummaging through his small bag and ended up elbowing me many times, and also opened up his tumbler to drink coffee, which I think is not allowed on the mrt.

The uncle ended up alighting 3 stops later. Seriously? You could not even stand for 6 minutes and let the sick girl have the seat? I told the girl to sit down again and she did so after glancing around. But I guess she was still scared as she dared not sleep and kept fiddling with her skirt quietly.

This is my first time encountering such a situation and I wondered if I could have done something different. If I reacted quicker and gave up my seat to the uncle instead, would the other passengers think that the girl was selfish? Would the girl have felt even more embarassed if I insisted on giving my seat to her? I dunno.

109,"“You got no daddy! You got no daddy!” 

This is the most common phrase used by the kindergarten children to ridicule me. Who is my father? Where is he? These questions didn’t bother me at all then. I just hate him down to the rotten core because he is responsible for all my misery. Fast forward to the age of 5, my mum brought me into a stranger’s home. An old sweaty, smelly and dark skin uncle stood right in front of me.

“Call papa!”

I refused to obey my mum’s instruction. I tighten my grip on my teddy bear and stared at him with a pair of furious eyes. When he stretched out his hand to offer me sweets, I swept it off  to the floor. My mother was furious at me for being rude to him, but father didn’t blame me at all. While I was watching cartoon in the master bedroom, my mum slipped off in secrecy. Yeah, I was abandoned by my mother. That was the last time I saw her in my life. She broke my fragile little heart and I kept crying non-stop for over a week. And so, I had to live with a total stranger who is my father.

My dad is a blue collar construction worker. His meagre salary is barely enough to pay the utilities and food. Despite being heavily tied down by our monthly budget, my dad tried to spice up my life by bringing me to places like Changi airport. I was fascinated by those planes taking off and landing on the runway. 

Me: Papa! Have you sat on a plane before? How does it feel like!?
Dad: Actually, papa also never sits on plane before. Maybe it is shaky inside.

A group of boys from better privilege family overheard our conversations. They started casting demeaning glances at us and giggled among themselves. I noticed that my father was deeply saddened by their actions. For the first time in my life I saw deep remorse in his eyes. 

Dad: Is papa very lousy?
Me: …….Yes! Very lousy!

Being his daughter, I should have put myself in his shoes and be more empathetic towards his feelings. However, I began to develop a sense of resentment towards my dad. I felt ashamed of having a lowly-achieving father like him. I told my primary school classmates that my dad is a doctor. When my lies were exposed, they started calling my dad a smelly beggar and me a motherless girl.

From that day onward, I stopped smiling when he was around me. Our relationship deteriorated further when I became rebellious in my teenage years. Our home transformed into a battleground where we engaged in frequent heated arguments. Even a simple question like “how is your school result”, could escalate into an argument. On many occasion I deliberately hurt his pride by comparing him with my friend’s parents, who were working in highly respected occupations. I even told him, “You are so damn useless, that’s why mum ran away with another man!” Later on, I began working night shifts in MacDonald’s because I just wanted to avoid him forever. 

When I was in JC, I wanted to participate in an overseas field trip organised by my school. However the cost of this trip isn’t cheap. Furthermore it would definitely place huge financial strains on my dad. Does that bother me? Nope, that is his problem anyway. I’m giving him an opportunity to compensate for my unhappy life. Because of this trip, I quarreled with him and even threatened to severe our ties. After a few days later, he finally gave in to my demand and left the money on the table. I revealed a proud and arrogant smile as I was immensely satisfied with this victory. Even if he die 100 times he won't be able to repay his debts.

One fine day, my form teacher informed me that my dad was involved in a construction accident. She told me to rush to the hospital asap because my dad was in critical condition.

This unprecedented event sparked off an internal struggle deep inside my heart. A part of me kept asking why he wasn't dead yet? I wanted to be released from my misery life once and for all. Yet the other part told me that I shouldn’t be heartless. In the end, I made my way to the hospital because I should at least have a proper closure with him even though I hated him a lot. The chief surgeon told me that he had done his best to save my father and the rest depends on his will power to survive.

When my dad’s supervisor saw me he told me, “You are really fortunate to have a good father like him, don’t worry he will be fine”. I was deeply offended by him for praising my father without considering what I have gone through. 

“Your father always like to hao lian that he has a pretty and capable daughter. He skipped his lunch quite often so that he can buy better food for you. Recently he requested to work more OTs in order to pay for your overseas trip. When I told him that he should rest, he said that you had never fly on a plane before, therefore he has to put you on the plane no matter what”

After hearing his words, I entered the ICU with a heavy heart. I touched my father’s hands and found out that they are very rough. He looked older now with those wrinkles on his face. While I was immersing myself with all those selfish thoughts throughout my entire life, I completely neglected my father’s unconditional love. I cried and begged him to live on for my sake. I kept apologising to him for being a unfilial daughter. Things shouldn’t end this way because for the past 18 years of my life I haven’t baked him a cake on his birthday nor make him a card on father’s day. Thankfully my prayers were answered.He pulled through the most critical period and recovered.

After my A level, I had to apply for university bank loan because my dad don’t have enough money to pay my fees. I saw deep remorse in his eyes again when he was about to sign the guarantor form. I held his hand immediately this time round.

Me: Pa, don’t worry! I will study really hard and earn a lot a lot of money. One day I will be able to bring you onto a plane and travel around the world.

Dad: Sorry, papa is very lousy.
Me: NO! You are a unkillable superhero.

 Thankfully I was able to secure a scholarship in my current year of study. This helps to lighten up my financial burden and allows me to  pamper my dad, once in a while. On one occasion we had our first taste of western carrot cake at a famous dessert restaurant. After taking a quick bite, we both stared at each other for a short moment. EEEWWW YUCKK! We still prefer the chinese carrot cake from the market. “Uncle,chai tao gue one packet. Add more soya sauce and chilli, the darker the better!”

111,"I was faced with a break up a while ago. Will just like to share some of the things I have learned and vent out my bottled feelings at the same time. You may or may not agree, but I still hope it will provide some valid pointers:

1. Just so you may already know, in every relationship, fights will happen, arguments will take place. However, do not brush issues aside and do not drag them for a long time, resolve them immediately, before you all go to sleep. Let your partner knows if you have any unresolved concern and work it out together as a couple. It is irresponsible to snowball things on your own and then eventually throw them at your partner when you think the relationship is beyond repair. Things will end ugly that way, let's not do that. I believe your partner would have his/her fair share of merits too.

2. Accept the fact that things will get habitual and become mundane after a period of time into the relationship (I guess roughly after the one year mark?). Both parties have to be prepared for that -- things ain't be gonna sweet and happy all the time. Therefore, try to inject some surprises for your partner now and then. It can be something small or something minor, it doesn't matter. It is the thoughts and sincerity that matter, I guess?

3. Make the effort to pay attention to your partner’s needs. Don’t be a snob and simply brush away your partner’s requests. I am not referring to just sexual needs. Even simple basic things such as wanting to go to a place for a meal or trying out a new sport, attend to them. Make time, make the effort to do these activities with your partner. Don’t just brush these requests away because it may be not your main interest or you are “too busy”. You are actually neglecting your partner when you do that. Nobody likes to feel neglected.

4. It sounds obvious, but always remember to communicate. A compatible couple should find it easy to communicate about almost anything. Let your partner knows what is happening in your life, listen to his/her response, discuss things together and let your partner knows what is your final stand. Don’t just think everything on your own and keep everything to yourself, your partner may feel isolated and unappreciated. If he/she is the right one, you two should be able to discuss about anything together. Some discussions/fights/arguments may be ugly, but nothing is uglier than discovering your partner is keeping things from you.

5. Everytime you feel super unhappy or pekcek, stop talking and take deep breathes. It is easy to say something nasty during a fight, but just like how you can’t pick up spilled milk, you can’t take back what you have said/typed. Learn to take a step back, give each other the space to think things through and calm down before talking things out. Also, choose your words carefully because words can hurt. A lot. All these are difficult things to be done, but trying to mend hurt feelings is a lot harder. Don't hurt the people you love.

So that is it. Sorry for the long post. You may think this is a troll, bullshit, naïve. Maybe. I am just sharing. Feel free to comment more on it.

I’ve made my mistakes and they have cost me my relationship. There isn’t one day I am not regretting about what have happened. Everyday I am earnestly wishing there can be a second chance, but unfortunately life doesn’t work that way. So I hope there won’t be many more people following my footsteps. If you are single, relationship IS a rocket science, be prepared. If you are in a relationship, cherish your loved ones well, don’t take them for granted.

I certainly still love my ex a lot, but all I can do now is hope that my ex is doing well and will continue to do better.

To the one who once loved and the one I truly love, do take care of yourself. With us moving on with our lives separately, I really hope our paths will cross once again.

I miss you.

In light of the recent spate of confessions (exams-related or not), we admins are getting annoyed and have a few things to say:

1. Starting your post with ""Admin please do not filter"" will only trigger us and make us more likely to filter your post. Increase your chances of getting approved with a catchy first sentence.

2. For goodness sake, stop asking about CAP and S/U matters. This university grading system isn't really that complicated. Read and re-read the S/U policy if you are unclear, or ask your seniors, or just freaking look for the posts from exactly one year ago and you'll see someone asking similar questions. CAP is just a matter of simple arithmetic that even primary school students are capable of.

3. If you really have a legit question about grades that you can't find anywhere on NUS website, emailing the school will give you the answer with more credibility as compared to asking the community.

Peace out.

114,"Since everyone is talking about relationship now, I would like to share the story about my first love. 

I was 17 and he was 18. We met while working part time and realised we both study in TP but different Programme. He hated me because I was his senior at work even though he was older than me and yes, he was a typical Beng who never once stop using vulgarities in every next sentences. After multiple quarrels over work matters, he one day dared me to ""ton"" overnight under block with him and his friends. Being egoistic, I did. Instead of quarrelling, we were trying to find out more aboout each other and ""argued"" to protect our own ego. We eventually fell in love. Before I share more about how we started and ended, I need to emphasise that my part time job was extremely important to me as I need to pay my school fees without parents support. 

He was really sweet to me and did everything he could just to spend more time looking at me. That includes putting more schedule to work together. One night, he sent a long sweet text asking me to be his Girlfriend. I agreed. Being a typical Beng, all his friends told me that it's their first time seeing him work hard for his Girlfriend and he must have loved me a lot. I can't deny that. The sweeter he was, the more deeply I fall in love.

After the ""honeymoon"" period (sorry, I totally DONT BELIEVE in that kind of thing), he started to spend more time with his friends. Joined gang, gotten tattoo, visited pubs and clubs, smoke a lot more.. and lie. He changed from ""even if I don't have money, I will bring you to eat the best food"" to ""eh, get your pay already right, help me buy cig leh"", from ""let's go town walk walk"" to ""I no money go out. I want to sleep at home"", from ""don't overwork and tire yourself"" to ""you so free go work, I no time"". I never once thought of giving up because all I knew was I love him and his ""good self"" will come back as long as I wait patiently. I paid for almost everything he wanted including tattoo and bought expensive gift for him that I struggled with my money. I almost quitted school due to outstanding school fees. 

Maybe I should have spoken to my friends about it so they could have advised me to end it off earlier. But I didn't share with anyone and cried every night on my own, feeling so hurt from not having the attention I needed. 

One day, my colleague texted me in the mid night and said
""I saw XXX on bus leh! He going out so late?"" 
""No la, wrong person la, he slept at 10pm leh.""
*sends picture* 
*dumbfounded* 

I texted his Sister to check and she guiltily admitted that my ex had been lying about him being at home. I burst out into tears. I went 711 to grab a can of Tiger because I really wanted to know why was he so addicted to drinking in pubs and clubs. I swear (at that point of time) it was the worst drink ever in my life. I threw away and walked to his house (since I was saving every single cent I have) and his Sister allowed me to stay in his room to wait for him. I cried for next 4 hours before he returns home drunk in the morning. When he opens the door, I could see his shocked face and suddenly turn ""drunk"" face. He came hugging me and asked me why was I there and kept saying he really love me a lot. My heart melted. I'mgonna forgive him, I told myself. 

But I'm still not that comfortable that I decided to check his phone and computer. To my horror... I found out that he prostituted, and planned with his friends about who should start to ""touch the girl"" who went to the pub with them before passing to next one and in constant sweet contact with another girl. He was still dead sleeping. I cried in the living room and his mum asked me to go home and rest first. 

When he woke up, he called me to ask where I was. He denied and said it was his ""gang leader"" is cheating behind his Girlfriend and needed to use his phone to call for prostitution and text the girl. I trusted and forgave him. 

We didn't meet for next few days and I suddenly receive a text from him asking for break up. I broke down in the middle of the mall. I called him and confronted him and he replied one or two word for every question I asked. He cried too. For someone who don't even drop a tear after gang fights, it was my first time hearing him cry. My heart soften, I said good bye and that's how we ended. 

I'm still single and he is now married with two children. I am still hearing about him and his life. I was told that his Wife is mistreating him and his family and taking kids for photo taking purpose only (that's cruel). Sometimes I still thought that if only we continued, I would have been the one and I will never do what the Wife is doing now. 

But I guess, that's what he gets for always cheating and ended up with a shot gun marriage. No hatred, no nothing. I always remember my first love because this relationship made me knows what I want and not want in a relationship. 

That was my first love and also the best relationship I've went through. Because no matter how hard I think, most of the time I still only recall all the happy moments we used to share.

115,"If you see an uncle studying in NUS, it could be me. I might be the oldest student in NUS, why is this so? I had a problematic past that is not known by many. The media had approached me on countless occasions to invite me to share my story. However I do not want to attract too much attention because uncle already has a family now. Luckily, social media is wonderful because I can share my story anonymously.

This is my story of how two women changed my life.

I grew up in a family with 3 other siblings and I’m the youngest of them all. Although my siblings are good role models who excel in studies, I didn’t follow their examples. In fact I was the most rebellious one who never failed to make my mother’s anger hit the boiling point. During my teenage years, I joined the secret society and done many notorious stuffs. Whenever I got detained by the police, my mother would never fail to bail me out.  But she would nag at me for the entire journey back home. “你为什么学人家打架？你再这样每三天就进警擦局，老板要炒我鱿鱼 了。”.  Later on, we had a big quarrel and I left home when my mother threaten to disown me.  I remembered before I walked out of the door, I told her that “I don’t need a mother like you, no big deal”. Looking back now, I realized how unfilial I was. That’s the worst thing I can say to my mother.

 My old secondary school was considered to be a rubbish dump, where all delinquents gathered. Fighting is like drinking water to us, only the one with the hardest fist command all respect. Growing up in this environment made me think that fighting solves all problems.  
I was never early for school. Every morning, I just simply stared at the prefect on duty, he/she would definitely be intimidated and let me in without fail. One fine day, I was late as usual. The new prefect on duty was a cute petite girl. I smiled at her and asked her to let me in but she refused to do so, hence I resorted to my usual intimidation method but she stared back right into my eyes instead. In the end, I my discipline master slapped me with 1 week worth of detention. I kept swearing and cursing because this little chilli padi wounded my ego. Therefore I decided that I had to teach her a lesson. After school, I gathered my underlings and went into to her classroom to mess up her table and poured out all her belongings from her bag. Initially she tried to fight back by scratching me insanely hence I had to push her back into her chair. Tears started flowing out of her eyes while she stared at me with a face full of hatred as if I had killed her parents. I’m a person who has a soft spot for girls who are crying. Being totally clueless on how to pacify a crying girl, I left in a hurry after telling her, “You win”. 

That night I just couldn’t forget the way she stared at me. I touched the scratch marks on my hand and smile. The very next morning, I brought a really big lollipop and waited for her to appear at the school gate so that I could apologize to her. She refused to accept my apology despite how relentlessly I tried. Finally she broke her silence and told me to take a step back. I followed her order without thinking and she slammed the school gate right in my face. “You are late for school again. Please wait for teacher to open the door for you bah.” I got outplayed out by her yet I’m not angry at all. Strangely I was feeling happy instead as I had developed interest in this sadistic little chilli padi.

The probability of me getting to know her is close to zero because I’m the kind of guy she detests the most. Luckily fate played a part in matching us up. When I heard that another ah beng was finding trouble with her, I raced to her classroom immediately. I dragged him out of the classroom and gave him a beating. I nearly got expelled due to this incident and I was shocked when I learnt that she actually begged the principal to pardon me. This incident brought us closer, then nature took its course and soon we became an item. I brought a super big Doraemon  plushie to school on the day I confessed to her. The size of the plushie attracted a lot of unwanted attentions. I literally sacrificed my reputation in order to woo her. Looking back now, it felt silly but chasing a girl requires you to do 100 or even 1000 silliest stuffs.

I should have cut my connection with the secret society and be a good son/boyfriend. At that point of time, brotherhood meant everything to me, fighting for my brothers is like a natural law. On the night of our 3rd anniversary, I received a call from my gang leader informing me that another gang had slashed one of our own. Before I could leave, she grabbed my arm and told me:

“Can you promise me that you will never get into a fight again? I’m very tired of it already. I will really walk away if you ever fight again.”

I brushed her hands off and lied to her that I need to go home to settle some family issues, before rushing off to meet my brothers. It was a path of no return. I collected my weapon from my leader’s van and proceeded to the clashing point. In the midst of all the hectic fighting, the image of my girlfriend kept flashing in my mind. This isn’t my first experience in this kind of fight but I was overcome by fear on that night. I started sweating profusely and voices of my girlfriend kept ringing in my ears repeating what she had said earlier. For the first time in my life, I was really scared therefore I ran away from the fight. A sharp object slashed through my arm when I was finding my way out of the mess. I knew that it was a deep cut however I gripped my wounded spot tightly and continue to run. I don’t know what I was thinking on that night, all I want is to see my girlfriend’s face immediately. When I she saw me at the door step, she burst into tears and started hitting me. I felt a deep remorse for breaking my promise to her. Not long afterwards, the police tracked me down and arrested me. Apparently someone had died in that earlier gang fight and I was placed under suspicion of murder. Till today, I can still remember the sight of her crying when the officers escort me into their vehicle. I kept yelling at her, asking her to just go home! But she simply refused to do so.

Murder is a very serious offense in Singapore therefore no amount of money can bail me out. It was at this point of time, everything turn for the worst under Murphy’s Law. My mother’s cancer condition worsens and her life hanged on a tiny thread. No matter how hard I yelled and knocked on the prison door, the officers refused to let me visit my mother in the hospital. The day came when my officer told me that my mother had pass away, I began to weep bitterly. I felt things shouldn’t end this way because I haven’t apologized for all the nasty stuffs I had said. I began to recall the times I spent with my mother. When I was young, I’m afraid of thunder storm in the night. Whenever there was one, I would run into my mother’s room and cuddle under her warmth embrace. During chinese new year, she wouldn’t allow my sibling to touch the chicken drumstick because it belongs to me. On the day of her funeral, I was allowed to make a short visit under police escort. When I met my sister, she got emotional and started shouting at me.

“You still got the face to appear here! Do you know how ma died? Even on her death bed she never stops calling your name with her final breath.”

I was utterly devastated by her words. Till today they haven’t forgive me yet.
 
Later on, the judge cleared me from all murder charges and gave me a prison sentence. While I was serving my sentence, my girlfriend would visit me every single week. Sometimes she would spot bruises on my body and asked me if I had gotten into fight again? Once in a while some troublemakers would find problem with me so that they can beat me up. The old me would have definitely retaliated however the new me simply shrink up while they rained blows onto me. I can’t continue living my life by relying on my fist. Therefore I started picking up my textbook again. I retook my O levels in the prison school. I worked really hard because I want to become someone my girlfriend can be proud of. 

As my release date got nearer, the frequency of her visits decreased. Obviously I was disappointed but I told myself that she might be busy with life. The day of my release finally came and the thought of holding her hands again created butterflies in my stomach. When I walked out of changi prison, she immediately hugged me and greeted me with a bright smile. Soon I realized that there was another guy standing right beside her. My worst fear materialized when I found out that they were dating. All these years in jail, she was the one and only reason that I’m able to keep my sanity under those harsh circumstances. But everything fell apart when she told me to move on with life. Honestly, I was really angry with her for a period of time as I felt betrayed. However, I took a step back and see stuffs in a rational way then things started to make sense. After all, I’m the one who let her down in the first place. I didn’t cherish her and squandered my chance of being together with her. In fact, I should be thankful to her because I might have continued my thug life and maybe end up dying on the streets if she didn’t appeared in my life. 

Both my mother and my ex-girlfriend made me who I am today. Realistically, I’m one of the few success cases. I hope that our society will remove our prejudice against ex-convicts. Everyone deserves a second chance. I hope my little story inspires you in one way or another.

116,"#29860 Offering my two cents as one of the girls on Tinder who sometimes just stops replying or ""forgets"" to reply. I don't speak for girls there to get Insta likes or stroke their egos, I'm genuinely interested in others and I've met up with more than a couple of guys who turned out to be really good friends or even something more. 
 
Firstly - you're probably right about how boring I am - I wouldn't be using dating apps if I was having the time of my life, would I? Obviously I'm sick of the same old rut I'm in and putting myself out there to strike a conversation or two. Ultimately, I hope to meet someone, hit it off with them, go on many adventures together and perhaps eventually, develop some kind of romance.

""What are you doing?"" or any derivative of that is a very common first question that comes across as lazy and disinterested. While definitely better than 'hi' or 'hey', you don't care if I'm pooping, or eating, or visiting my grandparents because you don't even know anything about me so while you could have the best intentions in mind, you would be better off going with another conversation starter. 

Going with something on their profile is definitely better. I'm more inclined to reply to ""That's a cute cat you have"", or ""I'm really into xxx as well"" (*proceeds to ask more about common interest). Of course, there would still be instances when she doesn't reply (for other reasons) but the hit rate is definitely better for this one.  

I'm likely to reply if the guy talks about himself, e.g. (Hey! I'm xxx, I'm in NUS (xxx course), I like sports, cooking, eating, etc, and then asks ""what about you?"" At least you've set some parameters and any genuine person can take the cue to elaborate on common interests.

A few reasons why I (or girls) don't reply after a match:
1. You construct your sentences poorly. There's no way I'm ever replying to ""wat r u doin""

2. The enthusiasm is dying. We've talked briefly about ourselves, and there is little common ground. 

3. But you say ""She stopped replying after like 2 sentences? She hasn't even given me a chance!"" Sometimes we just stop using the application. Maybe we're tired of the app or we've hit it off with someone else. Most girls have a lot of conversations so don't take it personally if the replies stop. Guys stop replying me as well. Most of the time it's not about you as a person. 

4. We realise we're not interested after all. I know this seems unfair but sometimes girls look for a certain type of personality or appearance, and even if they liked your profile initially they could still change their mind. Again, this isn't your fault. If you're using okcupid and messaging girls without a match, your hit rate is likely to even lower because you may just not be what she's looking for. 

I hope my honesty is appreciated. Can come back with more tips if anyone is really interested.

117,"This is my first confession ever on NUSWhispers.  I always felt like this is a really interesting platform where many people gather here to listen to heartfelt stories.  While reading numerous love confessions, I feel like it is my turn to share a love story of mine in JC.  
 
My story might not be very impactful but I would still like to thank you in advance for wanting to read my story.

The most right person I met in my life was this particular guy I met in my JC.  We call him Z.  We were classmates.  I can vividly recall the first time we talked was during freshman orientation.  I remember how we instantly clicked and soon discovered we had common interests, such as our music tastes and even love playing the same sport.  We also stayed near to each other, which gave us the opportunity to walk to the same bus stop together after school ends.  Gradually, we got closer and it became really apparent to the class that we spent a lot of time together.  Soon, my friends started ""creating"" more opportunities for us by always letting me to sit beside him during lectures, just so I could talk to him during lectures.  We also started to text more and slowly, he started asking me out to play badminton together.  I remember how I would also quietly watch him at the side and how my breath would be taken away with each stroke of his racket.  He always did it so effortlessly, like how he effortlessly made me fall for him.

Once, my friends asked him if he liked me, while we were hanging out.  I remember how I tensedup and thoughts of how he might not have liked me started flowing through my mind.  

""I like her, but I have my own considerations."" He unexpectedly responded.

What considerations did he have?  That caught me off guard and shortly after, my friend nudged me, teasing me how he admitted his feelings for me.  Then, they asked me the same question and I was too shy to admit and just brushed off with a shy smile.

That was when everything started going downhill.

When we went home, he started spilling his troubles, telling my friends and I how he really wanted to focus on his studies because of what happened in the past.  I guess what made me scared was when he told us to forgive him if he were to change.  At that point of time, I subtly got what he was driving at - he wasn't looking for a relationship currently and wanted my understanding of what he couldn't give me.  

That was also why I chose to confess to him, because I felt like since I already knew his feelings, it was also time he knew about mine too(although it was already pretty obvious). 
He admitted that he wanted my understanding and wanted to focus on his studies.  I could understand his intention and I respected it too.  I wanted to focus on my studies as well.

What happened subsequently was what I wasn't okay with.  Not at all.

Unlike the usual hellos and smiles he would flash to me, he chose to ignore me completely.  What's worse was how he could seem to be talking to everyone in a conversation but he would not look at me, not even once.  It was as if he ignored my presence.  It hurt, it really did.  Why did his attitude change so much?  What did he want to achieve?  I was not okay with how he dealt with things.  Couldn't we still talk normally as friends?  My friends started asking me what happened between me and him.  How could I answer them when we didn't even fight?  How could I answer them why there was this change when it wasn't me who wanted this?

This awkwardness continued to linger until J2, where things visibly got better because at least he could start joking with me a little and I felt more comfortable around him.  I was still not entirely comfortable with him like in the past, like how I could tell he still isn't really comfortable with me.  It frustrated me how he would take the initiative to talk and joke with our female classmates and how he never put in that same effort with me.  When it was just two of us, he had nothing to say.  I had nothing to say too.  And not knowing what to say is suffocating.  It certainly did not help when his good friend disliked me.  It made me more cautious and afraid when it comes to approaching him, especially when I see him hanging out with his friend.  The only time I had more guts to approach him was when he was alone.  But even then, I didn't really have anything to say.  I felt like he had moved on and my feelings were one sided.  He also started getting closer with another girl and I could see them hanging out in school.  It hurt my heart.  Whenever I see them together, I wished I didn't have to coincidentally pass by that exactly same place and see them laughing happily.  People around me started discussing about them and speculated that they might harbour feelings for each other.  It didn't feel good hearing about them.  And yes, I finished JC assuming that he didn't feel the same way as me.

It was a few months after JC, during results day where we met again.  We didn't talk but he still caught my attention and my heart still skipped a beat when I saw him(although it sounds really wrong because I was also attached back then).  It was later in the day where he texted me and asked me how I did when we started talking again comfortably, just as friends.

What made me really surprised was the long text message he sent me, telling me how his feelings for me was there throughout that two years.  I recall how I felt so happy reading this text and shortly after, how guilt and hurt struck me hard, reminding me of my current relationship status and my responsibility to stay faithful to my partner.  I couldn't help but badly wished he had confessed to me earlier.  I felt torn.  It was then it dawned upon me that my feelings for my boyfriend weren't as genuine as what I thought it would be and I think it was a reason why I always felt uncertain about my relationship.  I was also honest to Z about the relationship I had and how he didn't know I was attached, for he wouldn't confess if he had prior knowledge.  He felt really bad for ruining it too, although I reassured that he wasn't responsible.  I felt it was the best decision back then so I wouldn't hurt my ex. Yes I know I don't sound like a faithful partner at all.   I hated being that way too.

After ending my relationship with my ex, we gradually started hanging out and texting.  I felt really happy hanging out with him and I liked how that awkwardness we felt in the past suddenly disappeared.   We would spend long hours talking, holding hands and having short hugs at the playground till midnight and ending our meetups with his warm hugs was something I grew to love.  

It was as time passed by when we both realised that whenever we met, we were constantly talking about the past happy memories.  We rarely talked about the current memories we have and it dawned upon us that it was the past that bound us together.  We discovered that the feelings we harboured for each other was what that was built off past memories, and not of the current.  That was when we truly decided to move on from each other.

He was someone I loved the most out of all the guys I met, even more than the 2 exes that I have dated.  We might have stopped liking each other, but one thing would not change is the fact that he would always harbour a special place in my heart.  Looking back, he has brought a lot of laughter to me and while there are times I felt hurt from his actions, it was the beautiful memories we created that would stay with me.   

Hey Z, I don't think you would be looking through this website till 2 years later but if you do see this, I want to tell you again that you have been a beautiful memory to me and you would still be one in the future. 

Also, when we do have meet ups with our class, do come okay!

With love,
The girl who loved you for two years

118,"I have had a crush on you for nearly 4 years. The first time I spoke to you in year 1 you immediately struck me as really nice (in addition to being really cute). From then I had persistent fantasies about being with you on and off... everytime I remembered you talking to me, my heart would turn to mush. But the vulnerability frightened me so much.. this one guy without trying, now had the power to crush my heart or make me do anything with a single thought or sentence. I turned cold and aloof, I told myself I couldn't let you know, couldnt let anyone know. It hurt me so much to be such an ass to you, but I was convinced that I could not allow myself to show any sign of vulnerability. I have made many enemies in my four years, some without even trying precisely because of my tendency to assume the worst in people and shut them out by default. But it pains me the most when I remember shutting you out. 
A year or two later, I thought I had gotten over you, but I ended up in the same tutorial class with you for an elective mod. I was shaken. You obviously recognised me, I could feel you wanted to reach out in friendship (being the nice person you were) despite my being so cold. I floundered between being aloof and giving in to talking to you.. I gave in and gave you a ride back to FASS in my car because I was feeling really bad for being such an ass on purpose. That was the last time I spoke to you directly, the last time I gave in to my heart. From then on I was late for those tutorials and quick to leave. I would not allow myself to acknowledge your presence. I must have come off as crazy to you, as a cold manipulative person. But I knew it had to be done, I was just not doing it well enough.  
Another year would pass and I thought I had forgotten about you and my moments of weakness. Then I saw you in a scholarship mag.. you were going to work in the healthcare sector. It was no longer just infatuation on my part.. I now had a deep sense of respect and admiration for you. You were an econs major.. you could have gone to one of those large corporate bodies upon graduation and earned tons of money, instead you had a passion for contributing to people's lives directly through the public service and healthcare. You were more than I could ever hope to be, and crazily I wanted so much to tell you that..
In my last year, dreary and weary as I now am, from amongst the glances of distaste and belittling I have endured from my enemies new and old.. I saw you again that day at the Deck.. but when our eyes met, you turned the other way both in gaze and direction.. At that moment I realised I had achieved what I had told myself I had to do years ago.. and it broke me. 
I know that it would never have worked out.. I know that I would only have been a nuisance or burden to you. I knew that the moment you knew, you would have shunned me even earlier, hurt me even quicker. I know that it was what had to be done. But it hurts so much.
Because I'm gay, and you would only have looked at me with disgust. Because I have BPD, and you would only have seen me as a lunatic, as a flawed human. 
As we both graduate next year and you go on to greater things in life, I wish you all the best, a most successful career in the public service and all the happiness you can find. 
I'm sorry for everything..

119,"Hi all, just wanna share some thoughts based on my own experience. This is lengthy so don't read if you don't want to.

I graduated from NUS around 5 years ago, so I'm a little older than most people here, but young enough to understand the way we behave at Uni age. And one of the main things I've seen here is about the friendzone and how to get close to a girl/boy who are mere acquaintances, so I'd like to talk about that.

As a girl, I can understand what makes us tick and what turns us off, and guys really need to bear in mind that each girl's mind operates uniquely - so the one-size-fit-all approach doesn't work. Yeah, we like nice guys, we like well-to-do guys, we like friendly guys, we like sociable guys, we like clever guys, we like funny guys - these are some of the things that make us tick. I mean, come on and be realistic, you'd want positive vibes from your future life partner, wouldn't you? Why would you be attracted to negative vibes such as vices, violent tendencies or bad associations? (I'm sure some would disagree with me, but majority okay?)

But this doesn't mean we only look out for 1 particular trait that sustains the entire relationship. I think you should know that a relationship goes beyond those attractive traits, and despite these pull factors, a relationship deals with many push factors too. While the initial spark or coincidental meet-up can start the ball rolling, it is an entirely different ball game (ha) to keep the ball rolling. It is how these 2 people negotiate the push and pull factors that determine whether a relationship lasts till and beyond marriage.

Anyway back on topic - friendzone. There seems to be a huge negative connotation whenever this term is brought up or used on someone, and if you ever feel that way, there's a likelihood that you only have yourself to blame. Girls are pretty sensitive when it comes to how guys approach us, and your intentions can be sensed miles away. Sadly, there's no simple solution to this - because different girls tick differently! Some like the direct approach, some prefer the subtle approach, but literally 1 wrong move and you're 'condemned'. And honestly, I don't know why this is so difficult to understand. Not only girls, but I'm sure guys hate people who do things with hidden intentions/agendas. 

So, what's wrong with being friends first? As in, friends who hang out together, friends who have meals together, friends who plan for modules together, friends who plan for group holidays together and just have fun together, before plunging into the possibility of a relationship? Is there some sort of rush to chope someone before someone gets there? Don't you think it's kinda annoying when we literally know nothing about each other, except our physical appearance and how we dress, and you suddenly make a bold approach? It's not rocket science, to be honest :\ and yes, we know you're attracted to just our looks. And who knows? While your eyes were fixated on someone you don't know at all, you probably already missed a gem of a person whom you already knew but never bothered to understand better.

Also regarding the friendzone, I mentioned earlier that this zone exists for several reasons, so I'll just list some based on my personal experience:

1) History man
Weird history with other people

2) The sore thumb man
Despite your 90% positive vibes, there's some outstanding negative thing that we simply can't tolerate or don't envision living with. Overly attached, possessive, restrictive, manipulative also falls under here, among many other 

3a) The genuinely nice guy 
You're nice, and you seem nice to everybody, we don't want to be the bitch that broke your heart because we can't handle that guilt if things don't turn out well. (This is legit and did happen to me and some of my girlfriends - probably the saddest scenario amongst all I've encountered)

3b) The wtf nice guy 
You're nice, and you seem nice to everyfemalebody, um good luck fishing. I'm not biting.

4) The wrong timing guy
Approached while simply not in the right phase of life or frame of mind to commit to a relationship - Eh with relationships usually come a set of unspoken restrictions on how much time we have to set aside, how chummy we can be with other good friends, reshuffling of priorities even when we really want to go for that girls' night out - and this can really affect us in a way a caged bird feels. Not that we enjoy sleeping around or humping random guys in clubs, but the liberation to plan our time as we want with our friends is really valuable (at least, for me it is)

5) The overly persistent dude
Yah he kept reminding me that he'd be patient and he would wait, even when I was attached to other guys. I mean, that's commendable, but eh please don't believe that ""got goalkeeper still can score"" bullshit. It really just means you're hoping for the demise of someone's relationship.
 
6++) I think other girls can contribute more of their reasons.

So after all these guys, I actually did meet someone in my final year. We went out as/with friends for about half a year, dated for around 2 months. before we got together and we've been together ever since. I wouldn't describe him as an ideal guy by any standard, but I'd say that we both suit each other pretty well, in terms of temperament, future plans, family acceptance, religion and our day-to-day comfort of communicating with each other. Neither of us are overly attached or needy, yet after almost 5 years it still feels blissful to have simple things like weekend breakfast or catching pokemon at some hotspot. At the beginning we definitely had our differences but we stuck it out and strangely picked up each others quirks to the point that we're both acceptable and not demanding change from each other.

Some more things to note:
1) Don't get too hung up on looks. I seriously did not give a damn about exercising, grooming or makeup throughout my uni years - and I know I looked like shit. But once I graduated, I kinda forced myself to be more mindful of exercise, eating right and actually sleeping regular hours. I'd say I went from a -1/10 to a 6/10 la. SO THERE'S ALWAYS HOPE. Oh yeah I used to wear braces too.

2) Don't do that ghosting shit to people. It's terribly annoying when things which were flowing smoothly come to an abrupt halt as if you got kidnapped by ISIS or something and disappeared off the face of the Earth. 

3) Be sincere with people and their friendships. There's no reason why you can't be friends with the opposite gender AND STAY FRIENDS. Are you seriously thinking that every opposite-gender-or-whatever-gender-you're-interested-in friendscan only be your partner and nothing else? No, right? SO YAH. Friendships. I grew to appreciate male friends in my life who stayed in my life even when I got attached. Thanks for staying true, bros.

Ok bai.

121,"Reading #26986 reminded me of something quite similar that happened to me. 

I got to know a girl last year in school and overtime we began to text more and more and meet up occasionally in school. As the months went by I got to know her character and personality a lot better. That was when I realized that I was talking to a girl which is extremely hard to find in today's society. For starters, she has the nicest and kindest of hearts out of every other person I've met and also has this sense of wanting to help others who are a lot less well off. As an example, when we went out together I noticed her buying tissue from those old uncles/aunties you normally see at the underpass or overhead bridge. Not because she actually needed the tissue, but she genuinely wanted to help them by buying extra tissue so they can get more money. 

As I spent more time with her it really got me thinking a lot and I naturally did a lot of self reflection. Prior to meeting her, I was the type of guy who was rather impatient and expected things to be done my way, on top of being rather self-centred and not considering other ppl's needs. I'd also get quite irritated at the little things that happen daily, like someone walking slowly in front of you and hogging the walkway, someone suddenly cutting into your path, those aunties that push past you in the mrt etc etc. Fast forward a year later. I found myself becoming a lot more patient and understanding, especially when talking to others, and also developing a more compassionate heart and having that sense of wanting to help people. Believe it or not, she also actually helped me to rediscover my spiritual self which was severely lacking prior to meeting her. For those who are familiar with the MBTI model, my 3rd letter (F/T) changed from a rather strong T to a strong F if you view it on a scale. There are also a lot of other subtle things which I shan't mention. She changed my life in so many ways and in such a short period of time that it's difficult  to describe everything in words. 

Like the OP in #26986, I naturally developed feelings and slowly but surely fell in love with her. I spent many weeks and months trying to sort everything out and  eventually I confessed but obviously got rejected.  A relationship wasn't a priority for her right now as she had other more important goals in life. She already graduated is now overseas doing something really noble in terms of helping others in need. I won't mention the details, but you can probably count on one hand the number of ppl who would even consider doing such a thing. 

The rejection obviously hurt but I realized that if you love a person, then you'd want the best for him/her, even if it means that he/she wouldn't be together with you. To be honest even if she were to get together with another guy, as long as she's happy with him, I'll be at peace. There's this quote I came across a while ago which went along the lines of: ""If you love a person, let them go. For if they return, they were always yours. And if they don't, it's never meant to be."" 

Personally I feel that everyone will one day meet that someone special in his or her life, and that person may or may not be your future soul mate or lover. This person will forever hold that special place in your heart  due to what he/she did for you. I came to realize that life is so unpredictable and holds so many surprises, both good and bad. Who knew that the random girl I happened to talk to that day last year in the LT turned out to be the one that changed my life so much? 

Anyway, to S, I know you don't read NUSWhispers but if you happen to chance upon this post... From the bottom of my heart, I thank you for all that you have taught me and how much you shaped me to become a better person. I wish you all the best in your future endeavors and whatever direction you choose to take in life. Take care and God bless.

122,"Some weeks back, I was overjoyed when i received a full time offer from DBS as an investment banking analyst. Afterall, I, like many others, was led to believe that being an investment banker was the pinnacle achievement of any business student - where you would be raking in a 6 figure starting salary. This happiness however, was rather short-lived, when I found out that one of my batch mates was similarly offered a full time investment banking job - but at Goldman Sachs instead. What galled me is that this batch mate of mine was not exactly the most high-achieving of our lot, and yet he managed to secure the most coveted job at the most coveted firm of every business student?! It made me wonder deeply then, was it I was innately inadequate, or was I so deluded to think that a job at our paltry local bank would signify any form of ""success"" when there were others clinching similar positions at top-tier global banks?

And just like that, what was a joyous week immediately became a rather agonizing one - ruined utterly by a sense of inadequacy and jealousy. But the reason why I have decided to submit this confession is not because I am looking to rant, but rather it is because I have came to a realization that seems to delude many of us type A go-getters: You will never find true happiness if your destination is the yardstick of someone else's goals. A man driving a BMW may think he has arrived until he spots someone in a Ferrari - but to the average person, they would probably think that how could he possibly have worries if he is wealthy enough to afford a BMW? And indeed, comparison is the bane of all happiness, so for those of you who are agonizing over your CAP, your relationships or your first job - I'd say: stop comparing and start living, because you will never be able to appreciate the world around you if you are only looking at the never-ending horizon

123,"I told a lie to a guy, without thinking of the consequences it may have in the future.

However, we somehow got closer and we started to text and call daily. Even on a busy day, we'd spend our evenings face timing, always finding time for each other to talk and hang out. 

Dates with him were really just so amazing. We didn't do much but it was always really fun, like we would just hang out at random spots nearby my place or his. We just treasured each other's presence. 

Soon, we started falling for each other ( as cliche as it sounds ) and he asked me to be his gf. He would drive me out for food adventures and he'd come over and we'd bake. Whenever I needed to study, he'd come along and study with me and sometimes help me out because he's really smart.  I really had the time of my life with him and he's the greatest ever ( to me hehe ) 

Then one day ( not long after to be honest ), i felt like I couldn't deceive him further and continue to keep the truth away from him. So i told him the truth, he was alright with it initially and everything was okay. But i supposed it was the seriousness of the lie that made him feel uncomfortable and I could feel it, so I asked him and we talked and i had the hardest conversation i ever had with him. 

From then on, things changed and it was never the same. He stopped being sweet and his replies were slower and we hardly met and the frequency of the calls also became lesser.

From the start, I shouldn't have lied and i did apologize countless times for doing so and I would do anything to get forgiveness but the thing is what's said is said and I have lied and no matter how remorseful i am, the fact I lied doesn't change, does it. 

Was it better for me to have told the truth and lost him as my bf but still have him as my friend, or would it better to keep things away from him but I'd have to let the cat out of the bag someday and things could turn out worse. I hope i made the right decision, even if it hurts me a lot.

i miss him, i miss him a lot. I don't want to make him uncomfortable and i just want him to be happy so im letting him have things his way because that's how much I love him, but deep down inside, I really want him back.

But Fate works in mysterious ways.

I was in the crowded MRT packed like a sardine and then my heart beat and breathing stopped when I realized she was directly beside me. I didn't know what overcame me and I responded out of my shy character and said, ""Hi. You look good today. NUS right?""

She then pushed herself against me because there were more people squeezing into the train and they were probably pushing her from behind. My face started to become really warm and my heart kept throbbing as I can smell her fruity perfume emitting from her hair. Smells even better than coffee in the morning!

Then, we reached Buona Vista station where a lot of people alighted. Then she saw an empty seat, walked towards it and sat down, and leaving me standing there alone. Did she even hear me said hi awhile ago??

You seem to be telling people that sacrificing sleep can get you cap 5.0, and it is advisable to do so.

That's bullshit. There are people who can't get above 4 no matter how hard they work. And there are also people who get close to 5 without any effort. You can go and max your EVs, but if your IVs are 0 and you have a terrible nature, you still won't get anywhere. 

And don't care how smart you are or how hard you work, sometimes you just get unlucky.  Critical hit can always change things.

So why sacrifice so much for cap 5 when it's likely that you can never reach it anyway? As one of my good friends says ""Eh you all relax lah, when you 60 year old you going to look back and regret not getting A+ for this module meh? You more likely to remember the stupid shit we do together and laugh right?""

tl;dr
Don't stress over cap or do stupid things to boost it. It probably won't give you 5 anyway, and won't matter at all in the long run.

If you have indeed achieved CAP 5.0 through sheer grit, I'm glad that you clinched what you worked so hard not to sleep for. However, you have erroneously interpreted my advice. In my previous post, I did mention that people should work hard, which is something you advocate too. However, they should invest their energy in what THEY are strong and talented in while balancing studies. I have someone in my life I admire greatly who undertook studies in the sciences but whose real talent lies in writing and film. Instead of forcing himself to like the sciences, he took the initiative to seek out internships and opportunities related to journalism and is doing well. Another acquaintance takes business but is extremely fashionable. She takes OOTDs around U-Town and is relatively influential on social media. Not everybody is destined for CAP 5.0 because their true talents DO NOT lie solely in academia. Some of us are destined for journalism, some of us are destined for fashion, some of us are destined for cakes, some of us are destined for robots and some of us are destined to help others. A true trainer works hard for himself/herself while also uplifting other people who have different strengths. Nobody is trying to be the best version of you, we're trying to be the best version of ourselves.

127,"There was once an old lady sat next to me on the train after school. She started talking to me in Mandarin, with me only nodding my head in response (I was pretty tired from a long day at school). It started off nice enough, with her talking about how things have changed. Then, with a loud, accusatory tone, she said, ""这些外国人啊，把我们的工作和房子都偷走了。尤其是那些中国人。"" I wasn't surprised by her sentiments. I just nodded back in silence - not in agreement, but in resignation.

I see comments online accusing the government of 'buying' ""foreign talents"" like they're commodities to be traded and not actual people. ""Send them back,"" some say, like these ""foreign talents"" are defective goods which the government have wasted money on and should demand a refund for. How I wish money was actually so easily and nonchalantly thrown at my family by the government as these people presume it is. Decades ago, during the engineering boom in Singapore, my father was scouted to be one of these said ""foreign talents"". My parents left their previous jobs, their families, even their language and culture to come here; my mother told me about how she packed along a huge Chinese-English dictionary because she was afraid my father wasn't good enough for Singapore. We never made big money from the government or anything like that. My parents just came here looking for a better life, as did many other people all those years ago.

We're essentially a nation of immigrants, whereby the only possible distinction lies in how far back we draw our family histories. However, during introductions, I still hesitate to tell others my name. When ordering food at hawker centres, I always speak in fluent English/Singlish to the auntie or uncle at the stall, because my accent would betray me if I were to speak in Mandarin. Heck, I was born in Singapore, lived here all my life, went through PSLE, 'O' Levels, 'A' Levels and all that fun jazz. Having been drilled every morning at school since young, I can recite the national pledge word for word, sing ""Majulah Singapura"" note for note, and have no idea how my supposed home country's equivalent sounds like; I say ""supposed"" because the only home country I am willing to identify with is Singapore. Yet all that seems to be of less importance when others see or hear my name, or any name of a similar structure to mine. ""You from China ah? Your family from China is it?"" I dread the times when I hear those questions, because in my mind's eye, I can see the other party turning up their nose and narrowing their eyes ever so slightly at this 'outsider' in their midst, contaminating what they deem the 'pure' social fabric of Singapore. This is obviously just my paranoia speaking, however sometimes I can't help but feel like these fears may unfortunately hold the tiniest bit of truth, especially when I come across certain unpleasant individuals who brandish the title of ""true blue Singaporean"" in the faces of those they deem unworthy. Seriously, how many pink ICs must I hold, how many tuition classes do I need to send my future kids for, and how many plates of chicken rice must I eat before such people deem me worthy of passing through the golden gates that would mark me as ""a true Singaporean""?

128,"Hi. This is not really a confession but more of a recommendation to my fellow freshies. I did not join any orientation camps this year but I'm lucky to know a senior in NUS to tell me how to plan my timetable and I want to share this important tip with you guys.

Do you guys know that you can drop modules in CORS that has already been pre-allocated to you? 

If there had been bad reviews about the module/lecturer, you can avoid the pain by dropping it and bidding for another module. If you don't know of anybody who has taken the module, you can search for module reviews on google, or through NUSMods (e.g. https://nusmods.com/modules/ACC1002)

If you don't know what modules can fit into your schedule, be sure to use NUSMods as your timetable scheduler (pro-tip: boxes with curved borders -usually tutorials, can be dragged and re-scheduled)

Don't need to thank me :D

129,"Hi all, not sure if this confession will go thru coz I'm actually just a JC student whom recently chanced upon this website. But I think I can look to your guys for some advice on things.

I have read quite a series of confessions regarding r/s and I'm quite surprised by the number of parallels various confessions have to the situation I'm in now too. There are times where I feel I'm the only guy in this day and age who just has issues to deal with regarding uniqueness, acceptance, being relatable and to really be put to the test in the teenage culture of today. 

I hope to mention my story because I don't want to face the same problem ever again when I really enter Uni in a few years time. It WILL BE a tl;dr but honestly I prefer being through in my story coz these are the most complicated feelings and situations I've been put thru.

Like some of the confessors here, I also come from an all boys environment for both pri and sec sch. 10 long years... They weren't smooth sailing. I faced problems of bullying, politicking and not being able to assimilate into sch culture. Why so? It was just me being very different from other guys like perhaps my musical taste. It doesn't lie in today's kind of music but lies more towards the oldies genre like the Carpenters, seasonal tunes like NDP theme songs/Christmas songs, musical numbers or just classical music. Overall, I enjoy listening to music that has nice resonating tunes and meaningful lyrics because that's the beauty I see in them to express myself and my cheerfulness/sincerity.

Basically, I'm just this different (unique) from all others guys in practically every single aspect of preferences and interest.

So I eventually got used to the coldness by Sec 4 and thought that when it came to co-ed environment in JC, things will change and that the presence of girls in sch will check the maturity of the guys. I was so looked forward to finish O levels then.

I had hoped to make a big change within myself in JC to really step out and showcase my true self so that maybe I could be popular amongst the girls and really put all the other guys down to shame for like treating me so coldly. Yes because my sec sch has affiliation to JC so some of my ex-sch mates went over with me too.

When JC really began, I was called, as what my parents quoted, ""guns blazing"". In just 1 week+ into school as soon as time was right, I was more spontaneous in sharing lots about myself and showcasing all the unique interests/pref I had and everyone was pretty wowed by it. I felt so good about myself because it was during this period where I could catch all of the girls' attention.

I started to like someone in my new J1 class and eventually got rejected in pref for my Sec4-now-JC classmate. And from that point on my school life really crashed back down pretty badly as then I had to live through the awkwardness with her and face the burns of seeing them tgt. I couldn't bring myself to study either and that was for my first sem in J1.

I got scarred very badly from then for the fact that my uniqueness just wasn't the deciding factor and that I realised now it might be working against me to be seen as extremely out of trend and weird! I realised that girls at the end of the day will still choose to like normal guys and friendzone unique ones like me, despite the interest they might give.

Whilst this happened, I already had another classmate of mine always coming to Whatsapp (WA) me abt sch work/stuff. That still continued. It was only during the Jun hols when I went overseas and sent her my holiday photos that I talked to her more often online and started to realise how I might be having another chance again - and that she was better than the prev one esp in personality/attitude.

So for Terms 3 and 4 in, i slowly started to like her instead, but this time learnt the ways to not overtry and to only show my true care and concern when needed. I was so happy then that she still continued to ask me stuff online and that sometimes in RL, we would joke and be spontaneous with our conversations. It then felt so natural and so clicking. And that sometimes if I initiated things like going to consult teacher tgt just 2 of us, she didn't mind coming along. So yea, she already knew all about my unique interest and personality and still looked so energetic+interested when with me. But ofc, I still feared one day things will come crashing down again.

And it actually did at the end of the year, after all the exams, when I thought the time was right to ask her out. So I did. And did not get the response as desired. Since we still had 1-2 wks of post exam timetable left, I still had to see her in school. I then slowly learnt from my other classmates about how she was already gossiping amongst others about my feelings, much to my huge disappointment as this was the exact thing the prev girl did and that wow, nothing was kept secret after all.

Off to the Dec hols I went, now I learnt that my hypothesis was indeed right - that sharing so much about my uniqueness was working against me! Although this same girl still kept in contact with me over sch work and still didn't mind sharing with each other about our holiday, I knew deep down now the true extent of how all the girls saw me.

J2 began and I thought maybe I could restart my mindset and stay optimistic for the year ahead. For fact she still could talk to me despite the prev year, it was considered a feat for me. I still thought I could be myself around her and still talk just like last time. That was when the class dynamics resumed frm last year - to now ship us tgt. Eventually after a whole turn of events, she explicitly friendzoned me on WA. The meaningful stuff I said after that didn't matter one bit and I felt I wasted my time greatly and just threw my own face further.

Slowly, I started to feel angry over the past 1 year+ of events. It felt like I was being taken for granted despite me being kind and nice to help when needed. I just felt that I although unique, known for my uniqueness, made the greatest improvement for J1 Promotion exams, seen as reliable by other girls and guys in class, I just couldn't match up to anyone just because I was so different and in reality unrelatable towards others.

My close friends then advised me to then to change the ways I interacted with her esp online to not reply her WA help requests as soon as I got them in order to kill off the desperate impression I already built by then. Besides frankly when this year started, I could already feel a slight change in our interaction - it wasn't as lively as before. My care/concern-as-classmate qns were also ignored most of the time. She slowly gravitated towards talking and having fun with the other guys instead.

So I lay low for most of Feb/March, telling myself that I'm actually a guy who has achieved lots in other areas and that girls were just missing out on so much about me and that its their problem for not being accepting enough and maybe too preferential and play hard to get. I was angry with her and a few others for making my life so inadequate at times. I didn't pay much attention to all the love she got from other schmates when her birthday came. I wasn't feeling obliged much to do smth meaningful knowing it will ironically work against me. I didn't feel appreciated much anyway.

Things changed in April, somewhat. One night, She suddenly sent me one whole ton of photos of a worksheet that I missed out on because I left school as soon as it ended and didn't stay around with others. Few weeks later during one of the 2.4 runs to pass IPPT, she came to run with me for the last lap coz I was so tired then. I still failed the timing to hit at least 61 points though. I was wondering why she was initiating things again which wasn't her nature this year. My friends still told me to not be too excited by it so I just went as it is.

For May and June, the anger slowly died down. She still WAed me about school work and was still willing to sometimes tell me how her paper/exam went whenever I asked, inclusive of the time where she told me about her sudden vertigo thus absent from school.

For July, just last month, our relations seem normal. She was willing to take photo with me just both of us during a class cycling trip and is still willing to confide in me for her acad worries at times.

At this stage, I have come to the point where I'm close to her in WA but yet so far away in RL in school. Most of the time, I still can't bring myself to talk to her in RL and converse as in the past. There were instances where I will catch her at the wrong time where suddenly another guy will steal her attention away so its just this kind of unlucky factor that's dousing my confidence. Its like I'm better off not actually talking rather than looking silly in the end. 

Besides, she always seems to have a wonderful time joking around and being spontaneous with the other guys.  I feel so out of touch with their conversations and its like I can't simply join in coz its awkward. The friendship bonds already formed - ppl have their own jokes and stuff. So I'm in such a predicament now where tbh, I'm feeling bad because of all the outgoing traits she actually has and just looks so perfect in getting along with everyone. I'm just keeping this deep within when im in school and tbh at times putting fake cheerful optimistic vibes. But her presence makes me inadequate honestly in my EQ standards. I thought she was quiet and reserved just like me. Turns out yes, we do share lots of similar personality traits but just that she can code switch so seamlessly to be as outgoing as ever too.

Now such perfectness is just a grim reminder of my failure in my original aims to really get along with schmates of the opposite gender. Considering how she can get along so well with ALL the guys in my class and that she can actually be surrounded by all the guys at the table with her outgoing vibes. Its just a timely reminder for me that I have failed in being just like her - but the opposite - to get along that well with the girls at that kind of level.

So now all this is now playing part in my reflections as of this point of time. The past 20 months of JC has tried and tested me in all these ways and means. It has pushed me over limits I've never crossed before and it has also let me find out more about myself - especially on what I now need to work on. 

Well, I'm now known for making the greatest improvement in my acads since J1, seen as reliable, sometimes funny and for my uniqueness, other than that, just quiet/reserved as ever which was my original self anyways. I have come a long way in going back up again.

But still, sometimes when I look back, I think I could have done a whole ton of things a lot better and not end up like this. I doubt my true happiness is there - where I can be actually INSIDE and BE RELATABLE. I can be best guy girls could have ever met as classmates/friends. I can be even more spontaneous, funny and energetic as ever! I could even be the most trustworthy guy whom all the girls can confide with - a unique kind of relation I want to have amongst all the others. There's so much I actually still want to showcase about myself but I just can't at this point of time. But I'm just too quiet and reserved now to really fit in and I'm just like any other guy to them now. Well, I'm drained somewhat also, emotionally.

These are feelings no one in my class will understand. They're honestly still too innocent to truly understand my path. I notice this about myself though, I tend to always see so much more than others, I don't think my experiences have let me live such a socially sheltered life. Maybe I can't be as innocent as them because I have been through so much. Maybe that's why I'm so unrelatable. Besides, Im bad at small talk, its usually not me. Other than talking about my interest, I prefer striking meaningful conversations about the person themselves, exchanging experiences and giving advice where I can. I enjoy really getting to know ppl well and take the understanding from there. Sadly not many girls in my class can handle such conversations. They're all more natural with small talk standard. Idk whether if this is the reality or that its just them. Honestly, as much as I see merit in small talk, I still feel there's lots of reason to also ask about people too. Sometimes I feel its a sin to actually ask about them...and even more so in the first place - is it a true mistake to actually like someone? Like honestly - my story has proven so. I think my crush and I would still be just like last year if I didn't initiate so fast. 

So looking forward, especially in Uni, I'm not sure what to expect in terms of culture change - whether for the better or worst. I do hope to get into Engineering. And I now see the light as to why engineers tend to be stereotyped as nerdy/low EQ/cannot express themselves properly. Given my situation, I might end up just as whats perceived. I don't wish to be like this ever. I know where I stand given my experiences. I hope to be the exception to this stereotype and really be the one who can have the perfect balance of the nerdiness and the outgoingness. This will be the best way to get ppl interested in knowing more about what we do and that our work isn't that boring after all. I only hope to leave that legacy next time.

Looking forward, I only hope to apply the ways from my learnt mistakes in EQ to really still be myself and forge wonderful ties with girls and be an inspiration amongst the guys. I know I can find the perfect balance between my uniqueness and what's trendy out there and yet not deviating too much. 

And I still wish to have the innocent side of me and not be overly serious and matured. I'm only young once. My JC life hasn't let me truly feel that young thus Im scared to lose more years down the road. I still wish to have that playful, cheery disposition amongst the girls whilst I still can pass my young looks off.

So as of this point of time, I don't have any close girl-friends in school, unlike some of the other guys and its really quite a joke. Its like as if I'm only the reliable one, not the close one, only come to me for help and nth else much. Come to think of it, no girl has actually asked about me even when I have asked about them before. This feels too one-sided to actually not have support from friends of the opposite gender. I'm getting somewhat tired of having single-gender social circle too.

Sometimes I feel I have lost faith in the teenage culture of today, that every girl im going to meet next time can be this complicated idk. I've never had any girl-friend who has truly understood me as a person, even as friend. But actually I don't think I can entrust any girl now to just not judge... This is really not here not there.

A Few months remain in my JC time and I live day by day staying optimistic. But sometimes I get my bad days in my EQ to just spoil the optimism once more. I always tell myself to expect the unexpected no matter what kind of social situation comes your way.

And lastly for that person whom I still like even after 17 months and counting, I am currently feeling like-hate towards her as of this point of time. There were periods I just try and forget her and live my life normally but I still have to see her in sch everyday, and somehow I still feel the connection idk why. However, I wonder if she is treating me as a FWB to only come bravely talk to me on WA to ask for academic favours and nothing else. I sometimes wonder why I'm still helping her. And then sometimes I think otherwise that she truly sees me as someone to count on and that she is being genuine here.

So honestly were we even meant for each other in the first place? She's one of the cutest I've ever met and her resemblance of her personality to mine to be as energetic and spontaneous yet quiet/reserved too just makes me feel that I can really relate to her very well. 

I've been through so much ups and downs and disappointments even as her classmate/friend. Does this truly mean ""not meant to be"" as fated? Just want to find out the general trend of fate thus a ""No"" answer won't scar me further for life dun worry. I have become more immune from experience~

If you read this last line, I must thank you so dearly for reading through every single thing. Now that I've learnt, unlearnt, re-learnt, I don't wish to ever feel like this in Uni. So I thus thought it would be best to also let u all know about my position. Wonder if you all have any advice on surviving the Uni-culture in time to come and if this kind of inadequateness is a reality and not an anomaly.

PS: I apologise if I sound very gender discriminatory esp to all the girls reading this out there. Maybe I'm better off in a new environment to put everything in practice, that's all.

131,"To NUS Cohort AY2016/17: We have failed you.

The seniors have failed you. The public has failed you. The OSA has failed you.

The black sheep of seniors conducted outrageous sexualised activities. We have failed you.

The public, some of whom cannot discern fact from exaggeration. We have failed you.

The OSA, caught between hell and high waters, decided to sacrifice the Oweek of your batch to straighten things out.

Out of this Pandora's box of mishap, however, there is still one glimmer of Hope left:

Beyond any orientation activity, beyond any camp, certainly beyond any games that you play at the beach, you, your batch, have this saga as a common bond amongst all of you. From Business to Science, from Arts to Engin, your shared experience of having the Oweek cancelled will be your unifying factor. You will be the first batch to have a common (and ironically, uncommon) event to define your batch spirit, and ultimately this is the NUS spirit. Out of the mistakes we the seniors have made, your batch will rise up to take the challenge that every freshie henceforth will have a safe and fun orientation. Your batch shall be the pioneers of a new era, hopefully a better one, where the balance between common sense and the energy of youth can be found. You will prove to the Singaporean public that the youth are not afraid, we will admit what needs to be changed and will change it to be even better.

To the seniors who have poured their heart and souls dedicating yourselves to a fulfilling orientation for the freshies: here is my salute.

To members of the public who has tried to reason and weighed the situation in spite of all the sensationalising by the news outlets: here is my salute

To OSA who are trying to salvage the university's dignity: here is my salute.

And to Cohort AY2016/17, here is my salute for being the sacrificial lamb cleansing almost a decade of wrong. I give my challenge to you: break traditions. Forge friendships that even we the seniors would have never dream of even with orientation camps. Give the best orientation the next cohort of freshies can ever have. We will stand by you. Because we are NUS.

132,"Hi Freshies of AY2016/17,

Here's a few handy tips for surviving in NUS:

2. http://libportal.nus.edu.sg/frontend/index - For textbooks/past year papers/ Research papers (Very important!!)

3. https://app.box.com/files - A sneak peek at most of the modules available with complete lecture notes/tutorials/etc

4. http://www.nus.edu.sg/cors/ - Bidding has already started ! 

5. Plan your modules using this nifty website developed by our very own students : https://nusmods.com/timetable/2016-2017/sem1

6. General rule of thumb across all schools and faculties in NUS is to never plagiarise. Always send in your final report through a plagiarism checker first before submitting. NUS takes plagiarism very seriously (I know because I was nearly expelled  for one of the assignments during Y1S1). 

By the way, intentional or unintentional lifting of sentences of paragraphs constitutes an act of plagiarism. 

7. Plan your modules well. Those who fail to plan, plan to fail... has never been truer. At least for me lol.

8. If you are feeling depressed, seek help. There are great counselling sessions (and medications) at the University Health Centre (UHC), the place where you did your body check-up prior to matriculating. Talk to friends, join a CCA ( if you don't like it, quit. Don't force yourself into liking something.. it is quite toxic.)

Depression is not a weakness of the mind in much the same way as diabetes is a weakness of the pancreas. They both need treatment immediately to help you to survive. 

To live however, is an entirely different matter ha ha... ok I digress.

9. Sometimes, the friends you make in school lurk unassumingly in lecture halls, CCAs, gym, random smiles at the bus-stop, common modules taken, friend intro etc etc. I made a very good friend for one of the modules taken during Y1S1. While he was an introvert (or so i thought), I made small talk with him and before I knew it, we became fast friends.

The number of good friends I've made in NUS can be counted on one hand. But they have provided me with valuable information, laughter, HTHT sessions and whatnot.  These friendships were all forged in the above mentioned places and sadly not in camps ha ha.

In life, you only need a few good friends that have your back when you need it. That and your Significant Other HA HA.

1. I believe I triggered the OCD in some of you when you noticed bullet point one was missing at the beginning of this post.

That is good. Attention to detail is very important. Ok i digress again.

Anyway you can skip the previous points mentioned because this point is the most important. 

And that is to enjoy what you are learning in school. If you don't like your major, change it don't drag. If you find some modules you've taken to be boring, make it interesting (or drop it before week 5?). Don't dwell on the past (failures? bad grades?) or worry too much about the future. Enjoy learning in the present. It is a gift. Time lost which cannot be recovered.

Anyway this post is freaking long so imma just peace out.. gotta live my life now :D

Cheers,
Your senior

Due to the recent rise of trolls roaming around in the comments, we have done some cleaning up (aka banning). We would also like to seek your help in identifying them and reporting to us by private messaging our FB page or posting a confession.

On a side note, we have recently removed a post made by a user masquerading as a faculty club’s committee member. Confessions posted signing off as official organization / bodies will be rejected as we are unable to verify the authenticity of the sender. Should any organization wish for NUSWhispers to post / clarify something, they can email us at nuswhispers@googlegroups.com and we will be glad to help.

On our part, we intend to build better moderation tools that make use of artificial intelligence, natural language processing, machine learning, big data, sentiment analysis, internet of things, augmented reality and virtual reality to alert us about troll comments and we can make this page a better place for everyone. Stay tuned!

137,"My affinity with other people has never been good. I wanted to be myself y'know, the talkative and enthusiastic me, but people didn't like that. Although they smile in front of me, I am aware they talk bad about me behind my back, sometimes they make it seem as though they deliberately want me to know they don't like me by hurling sarcasm whenever I do or say something. Words like ""annoying"", ""busybody"" and ""act cute"" are often used to describe me.

So I started to behave more quiet and reserved, hoping their negative views will change. And it did change. Unfortunately, it changed into other negative views. People started to think I am being ""stuck up"" and ""anti social"". So I stopped it and went back to being myself since people just didn't like me no matter who I am.

4 years ago today, it was my 21st birthday. This is probably one of the most important birthday for a young woman since it is the day of official entering adulthood. So I invited about 20 friends to my party. I will spare the details since some of them are from NUS too. Anyway, my single parent and I spent weeks planning and preparing this party, and I took quite a bit from my own savings for the place and food, since I wanted my guests to know how much I value their presence. When I invited them, almost all 20 of them promised to come. I even told them not to get me any gifts since I only desire them to be present on my special day.

And guess what happened? Less than 5 of them showed up during my birthday. There were food for 20+ people but only about 3 of them showed up (the other 2 dropped by for awhile but left for their own activities). I was really very sad, not because the money spent on the place and food is wasted, rather because so many don't regard me as a friend at all. As for those who showed up, I am most grateful to them and they even brought me gifts even when I told them not to. 

After the party, I hid in my room and cried because I was deeply hurt by the absentees. If they told me in the first place that they cannot or do not want to come, I will probably be less hurt. But they just message me on my birthday itself, saying that they cannot make it because they have something on. That day of transcending into adulthood was an unpleasant one. I will tear up whenever I think about it.

I've seen other people's 21st birthday as one of the most memorable, yet mine was a complete disaster. I kept asking myself why are people treating me like that. Maybe it's because I am not a popular, beautiful, rich or intelligent girl, and being friends with me does not give anyone any personal benefits? Is this how people choose their friends? I don't want to assume, but I bet it applies for most.

In conclusion, I have learnt an important lesson; you can't please everybody. To be honest, despite being disastrous, my 21st birthday had filtered who truly treasures me as a friend and person. I guess the downside of everything always has an upside, similar to a coin.

Today is my 25th birthday. And just as the past 3 years, I will be spending this special day with one of the 3 friends who showed up during that unforgettable 21st birthday. He is now my husband :)

139,"Filial piety. A virtue that every Asian society tries to uphold. In other words, if I treat my parents badly, others will despise me for it without even knowing what's the true cause of such a ""socially undesirable"" action. And whenever I talk bad about my father or mother, the people around me will say that I ought to be stop being so negative, and should be grateful to them for giving me life. I haven't told anyone my whole experience. And I won't be grateful to my parents. Even till this day, I hate them, especially my father.

I was never close to my father since young since he rarely treated us like a family. And the only interaction he had with me and my mother is nothing more than asking for money, or screaming at us over some misplaced item at home. He has a decent office job, but he is always squandering his money with his useless friends on drinks and dunno what. There were tons of incident when he came home drunk and smashed everything in the living room just because I forgot to put the telephone back to its original place. It was hell whenever he came into sight.

If that man is biggest scum in the world, my mother is probably the stupidest person in the world. She always let him do whatever he wants. I really don't understand why she refused to divorce him despite his madness. And she always said to let things cool down, gave me some extra pocket money, and told me to move on with my life. I usually obeyed her since she treated me quite well. Back then, I asked myself is it because she loves him? Or is it because she fears him?

There was an incident which I could never forget the harm inflicted on me.

During my poly after school, my father, in the first time of my life, called me to offer me a lift home. It felt so abnormal. Initially I refused because I wanted to stay away from home and away from him. However, he just kept insisting and told me he bought lunch for me. So I agreed. And for the next few days, he did the same thing. But I still never said anything much to him. It felt too surreal and too good to be true. I thought maybe he struck the Toto or 4D hence his good mood. Then instead, he kept talking to me about this 大老板 (big boss) he met at a club who can offer him profitable opportunities. And he said I should meet him too since he can give me opportunities as well. I didn't gave an opinion since I just wanted to focus on my studies then.

One day, he brought this person back home. This 大老板 is a middle aged fat guy. My father was so happy and friendly to him. A fucking hypocrite. I never liked the first impression of that person, he spoke loudly and arrogantly, and kept telling my father our house is too small but once he made the money, we will live in a huge house. Seriously, What shit right does he have to judge what kind of house we live in?! He sounds more like a snake oil salesman, rather then the successful businessman he was supposed to be. 

I wished my mother or brother was at home during that time. At least I can talk to them and pretend I was busy, instead of being forced by my father to talk to that man. He kept saying to my father 你的女儿很美 (your daughter is beautiful). I felt really uncomfortable as that man kept repeating that again and again. I just wanted to leave the house, so I quickly went back to my room and take my bag. I was so shocked that man actually followed me into my room! I scolded him for the lack of manners, but then my father came along and told me his friend was interested in me. And my father told me to keep him entertained. I couldn't fucking believe what he said to his own daughter. I just pushed my way through them and felt that man brushed my breast, but I fortunately managed to rush out of the house. I just kept crying because I didn't know what I can do, and I didn't know who can empathize with me.

I told my mother about the incident but she just didn't believe me. I pleaded her to confront my father, but she refused to stir up any trouble because she thought I was pulling a childish act. And my brother is nothing more than an emotionless nerd who has no awareness of the world apart from his stupid computer games. And I believe none of my relatives and friends can help me, and it was too embarrassing for me and my family if I told them what my father was really like. I was also unsure if calling the police can help me get rid of my father and that man. Or will it make things worse?

From then, I totally ignored both of my parents, and worked as a waitress in order to earn my own allowance. And I guess that man who tried to get fresh with me didn't gave my father any golden opportunities after all, since we were still living in the same small house. My father was back to his usual self. Good. With fucked up personality like his, if he became more wealthy, the whole world will suffer.

A stroke of luck happened two years ago, I won a decent amount of money from Toto when I bought it in desperation. The winnings can cover my university fees, expenses and even allowed me to rent a small room outside. So from then, I have been living away from my family and I won't ever want to contact my parents again. Although I still occasionally WhatsApp my brother to receive his one word reply.

My landlady and her small daughter treat me like their own sister and they gave me the love I could never get from my own family. My landlady cooks for me, she helps me with my laundry, and she even offers discounts for my rent and utility bills. I never told her how fuck up my father is, I just told her I don't get along with my parents and I lied that they are paying for me. So I hope to quickly complete my university education and find a better paying job to move on with a new life.

Filial piety is mandatory? No. Only to parents who deserve it. To me, mine are more or less dead.

144,"My CS friend was boasting about the AAA entry grades and high starting salaries of CS people. Given the end of Moore's Law, I seriously doubt computing is a field that will continue to innovate in the long term. 

Programming skills are seriously easy, anyone can pick up it up. The fact is you don't need a CS degree to pick up a coding job. Outsourcing is common too. Any programmer in India or China can do your work at a fraction of your pay. With the upcoming O Level computing subject and increase in coding literacy, coding will become like reading and writing. Commonplace skills that society will soon commodotise. Do you hire someone to transcribe letters for you anymore?

The bubble will burst soon. People were hyping CS careers just before the dot com bubble burst in the early 2000s. For the sake of you long-term career, pick up a general degree like business or down-to-earth engineering degrees like EE or Mech. Engineering graduates can always switch to programming if they want to but no CS graduate can ever switch to EE.

Hello NUSWhispers fans,

Our team would like to address some of the concerns regarding Fessup.

Firstly, we would like to make it clear that NUSWhispers is NOT collaborating with Fessup in any way, neither do we have an intention to do so.

Like most of the other local confession pages, we have been approached by them for a possible collaboration. We have decided to turn down their request as we have our own platform to maintain and approve confessions.

Nevertheless, we are disappointed that Fessup continued to imply that NUSWhispers is supported in their product based on their Facebook advertorial.

We have been, and will be rejecting any confessions regarding Fessup.

Secondly, we would like to address a Medium article made by its founder claiming that he has been a victim of cyberbullying on NUSWhispers.

We would like to make it clear that we DO NOT condone cyberbullying fellow users within the platform. In the past we have been banning several users for troll commenting and sending warnings to commenters who may have crossed the line.

150,"Dear NUSWhisperers,

I noticed recently that some of us have difficulty feeling up to things or just being happy. And as someone who came close to depression but is feeling much better now, I would like to share some practical tips to improve your life - these worked for me and I hope that they will work for you.

1. Jump out of bed, open your windows and curtains 
Getting up quickly in the morning makes you less lethargic and miserable for the rest of the day. I find that experiencing fresh air and sunlight in the morning gives me energy.

2. Exercise
It doesn't have to be a daily 5km run. Doing simple stretching exercises, chest stretches, pushups or even jumping jacks wakes me up and helps me prepare mentally for the day ahead. I find that steps 1 and 2 have improved my daily mood significantly, and I think my friends and family have noticed the difference.

3. Get out of the house/hall/residence
Home is where you are conditioned to rest and your mind to wander, and introverts may know that sometimes your thoughts are self-destructive or self-consuming. So go ANYWHERE outside, to school to study, go shopping, or just walk in the park. Spend as much time outside as possible so that you appreciate your home and come back to rest.

4. Find supportive friends
If you observe very carefully, some of your friends are more genuine than others. Find those that truly care about you, rather than ""fair-weathered"" or ""fun"" friends. If you need to get work done, find friends who are driven so that you guys can help and motivate each other. Finally, for those with relationship woes,

5. Spend more time on yourself
I used to be one of those people who preoccupied my time and thoughts about the person I liked, in hindsight, it wasn't a good experience. Now that the infatuation phase is over, I can now speak to her normally and have a genuine interest in her before deciding whether to make a move or not.

The saying goes, ""spend so much time improving youself that you have no time to criticise others"". Instead of changing yourself so others will like you, I suggest taking time to explore the real you and working towards improving yourself. Have the confidence that someone amazing will be drawn to that, and seize the opportunity when it comes.

Have a great week!! :)

152,"To the OP of confession #16944,

You might not know me, or you might do. I am one of the regular contributors of comments on NUSWhispers, and coming across your confession post my heart broke a little more inside for you. Your mental strength to even compose yourself enough to write what you wrote, without malice of exposing the architects of your betrayal is something I both admire, and yet at the same time add rage towards your friend and now-ex that had wronged you in the most heinous manner possible. 

I have only dated once in my life. Wasn't as long as yours, heck it wasn't even as long as what most people would have dated on average. I was with my ex for the three to four months before I left Singapore for university overseas. For someone who admittedly was not blessed with luck in love, she meant everything to me back when I was a more turbulent and tempestuous being. For someone who had been planning to leave Singapore, study overseas and never return, she gave me reason once again to hope for a future with someone here in Singapore, someone whom I could share my life and heart and love with. 

Slightly more than a week after I arrived at my university, what had started out auspiciously as our budding LDR suddenly went sour. For no reason my ex ghosted me on all communication channels. Whatsapp, Facebook, phone calls, everything. My mind went into overdrive and I nearly went mad with worry over her safety and our relationship. I still remember vividly the afternoon that I was in university attending events for Freshers' Week when her Whatsapp message came through. She said that she had found out right after I left Singapore than she was pregnant with my child, from our last night spent together in the same bed. We had done it only twice in our relationship, and according to her words against all protection we both took she still struck the biological jackpot and got pregnant. I was shellshocked to read next that she ghosted me the entire week because she was pondering her decision to make, and that the very morning she Whatsapped me she had just come back from the clinic where she had induced the abortion, and with that she broke up with me. 

Two hours after I received the message I had booked the first flight back home that I could. Five hours after the message was read I was on the train to the airport. No phone calls went through. No messages went answered or even read. I called my parents and broke down on the phone to my dad, and to his credit he did not tell my mother the terrible incident, and fully supported me to fly back home to see what support I could give for my ex, or failing that how best to end the relationship on a proper footing. My train got delayed, and my flight left early, so I ended up staying overnight at the airport hotel before catching the first flight back the next morning. I had fallen badly ill throughout this time, and my family doctor whom I subsequently visited when I returned home said he would have grounded me from flying had he seen to me in the country from which I flew from.

When I arrived back at Changi Airport I tried to contact my ex again, and when I failed I did the only thing I thought an honourable man should do. I called her mother and tried to find out where her daughter was. She was surprised that I was suddenly back in Singapore until I confessed to her everything my ex told me. I guess you could call it foolish honour on my part, I genuinely thought that I'd offer myself up, physically and mentally and emotionally for whatever punishment that was to await me from her parents, if it meant that I could somehow see my ex again and find out the truth of the matter. But it was not to be. 

My ex sending me off at the airport proved to be the last time I'd ever see her face again. After their own personal discussions both my ex's parents called me back. Far from the anger I  expected to receive from them, their responses were very much the opposite. They thanked me for being an honourable man who would fly back from two continents away to attempt taking responsibility for their daughter, but that they couldn't persuade their daughter to see me one last time and end things right. In the mother's words ""our family does not want anything more to do with you, so I thank you for being a good partner to my daughter for the past few months, and that you fly back and complete your education. Leave my daughter and this relationship behind, forget that we ever existed."" And promptly after I returned back to university, my ex's family and friends all blocked and deleted me off every single avenue of contact, online or through the phone. 

The clincher of all this was that when I returned back to visit last summer, I got into contact once more with a mutual friend of me and my ex. And she finally told me what I had suspected all along as I dealt with the emotional turmoil of a breakup so bad alone in a foreign country. My ex had never been pregnant, the friend told me. She thought I would be like most guys who would be scared off with talks of pregnancy by their hands, and that fundamentally she decided to break up after we started our LDR because she was paranoid that I would not be able to resist the temptation of foreign girls compared to her waiting for me back home. So I lost my first proper relationship and the girl I loved, to her paranoia and a lousy lie of a reason that left me emotionally wrecked for the rest of the year to come. 

So, OP of confession #16944, I thought that with your courage of sharing your breakup on NUSWhispers that I'd share mine as well. Might not be comparable to yours in terms of magnitude (god knows I didn't even get to a first anniversary, much less BTO talk), but I believe our stories though different share a similar trauma. The rage and despair you feel now must be unimaginable and almost unsurvivable. No words will comfort you, no gestures will warm you. You will be playing over everything in the past you shared with your cheating ex and castigating yourself on what you did wrong, and what you could have changed. But as someone who took almost a year to move on significantly (and not even fully) I can tell you this. Time will heal you, whether you believe it does or not. Do not blame yourself, because the last thing you need now is to bring yourself down when others have given you such a crushing blow that few will ever receive in similar fashion. I hope you will have better fortune and mental fortitude to deal with the emotional scars you must bear with such pain now, than I had with my own wounds. I'm still fighting every day to move on, to live on and love and feel again after all the trauma that I had gone through. We all will have to, you and I both and others out there who have similar stories to share. But know that you are not alone, you will never be alone, and that what support I did not receive back in my darkest hours I am offering mine to you when you need it most now. I do not want you to come out of everything as badly or worse than how I came out of my own breakup. There are enough people in the world who are irreparably hurt emotionally, you deserve so much better than the cheating ex and traitorous friend of yours. 

Keep breathing, keep fighting, keep living, don't stop hoping. We are the ones who have to go through hell and high water because of our love for the wrong people in our lives, but I believe that Fate will ultimately prove kind to us and give us back what we've lost. If you're still wondering who I am after reading all this that I've written, I'm the only comment contributor on NUSWhispers who is currently studying in the UK. Talk to me, message me, I will always have time for you and I will always have your back. 

Never forget, never regret. Stay strong brother.

153,"So I have this very close female friend. Typical story. Boy and girl. Childhood friends. 

But we never dated. We never fell in love. Or at least, the very least, we never confessed to each other.

Recently, one mutual friend disclosed to me a secret. That my childhood friend actually had a crush on me before. 4 years ago. But she never spoke of this crush ever again since. 
And now i think back, her actions back then really did seem so. Small things, minor things like asking me out, calling me more than often.

We shared many ""first times"". We had many memories together, went out together (though those weren't official dates) and we talked almost everything. Very naturally, carefree. Mostly on the phone. I find that a feat cos i cant really engage in a non awkward convo with others on the phone except for her.

The thing is, I love her. I truly do. But i dun know as what:
I care for her. But our r/s, as corny as it sounds, is akin to a brother/sister relationship.
While I feel that I can spend the rest of my life with her, married, cos she knows me before, I dont have other romantic feelings for her.

I dont fantacise about us having intercourse, yet i always picture us having a family. I dont feel the urge to kiss, hug her, yet I want told hold her hand, to never let her go.

Recently, i felt that she is slowly leaving my grasp. She is having her own life. Own friends. Friends whom we didnt share. Her own new social circle. We shared schools, classes (from pri sch to JC ) for so long that i barely remembered what was it like without her . We studied together,  shared notes, copied each other's notes. We meet up lesser, and i don't blame her. 

I never dated.
She is in her 3rd year. I barely completed my 1st. (Cos ns ).
They say it is never too late. And i am ready to confess. To make a change. But before that, i really need to know:
Should I? Do I love her enough to be with her? Or is my love for her too platonic? Is it normal to have such a platonic love for my best friend? Are we indifferent from parallel lines - so close together but we will never meet?  If so, will it be fair for her? Will I hurt her if she knows that, I dont harbour the most romantic feelings for her.

Please help. ;'(

155,"Girl you promised to stay thru thick&thin with me. Did 4 years of dates mean nothing to you?
Friend, you saw me at my lowest. We knew each other for 7 years.

And today I lost them both.
ladies and gentleman, I just found out that my girlfriend has secretly been in love with my best friend for- (wait for it) - the entire length of our relationship.
Getting together with me was , i quote "" in a bid to get closer to [best friend's name] ""

It gets better:
They were together and she has been cheating on me for a year now.


And here is the climax:
I didn't find out.
She finally confessed, when I proposed.

Yes 
Proposed. 
Not with a ring, but the singaporean way of introducing the idea of applying for a BTO.

And now you two don't return my calls, texts and avoid me when I see you down the hall.

I don't even have the time to be mad. I barely just digested all this shit.
Like the times when you said you were sick but your friends said they saw you outside. 
I thought that was just a white lie.
Or the times when you said you were at home and I was at your doorstep surprising you but turns out you were outside (with him?) and you just settled me down with a jkjk (;

I am a guy. I have lust. I have urges.
But more than that, I had respect for you. for you and your wishes.
Abstinence you said. 
Not ready you said.
Fine, I said.

And then you went on to tell me that day (dear readers, did i mention she broke up with me over the phone?)
(no it wasn't a call, it was whatssap. Then she blocked me), THAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING IT WITH HIM FOR - I quote yet again - ""quite a number of times"" !?!?!

Dear audience, ain't this wonderful?

I have had it. 
I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't wanna call you out.
I gave you face which is why I didn't wanna make a fuss in the canteen the other day when I confronted you.
But you can't avoid me forever.

And up until now, all I wanna know, and all I was ever thinking,  is why....

p.s. considered placing a screenshot of the long long message but
1) it is too long and the screenshot of the entire message is 5 pictures
2) she uses unique spellings that would have been a dead giveaway to her identity.

156,"Whenever I see a rich kid studies on a scholarship, I feel sad. I always believe people who can afford essential things like education should use their own money to pay for it, instead of depriving the resources from someone who needs it more. One example would be my maternal cousin. Ever since we were young, his parents are very successful. He can afford many things and was probably given the best private tutors money can buy. In addition, his mind is free from any financial burden, thus he can better focus on his studies. My parents are poor on the other hand. This is probably because my mother who is the elder sibling, gave up her education for my aunt as my grandparents couldn't afford to send both to school in the 1970s. Hence, being uneducated, my mother met my equally uneducated father and the both of them struggle to make ends meet as low skilled workers after marriage. Whereas my aunt received a good uni education, met a high income lawyer in her work, gave birth to my cousin and stopped working.

The stress caused by financial troubles usually affects my family, thus affecting me as well. Closer to exams, while others are intensively studying, I cannot give up my part time work because I may lose the job. Despite all these, I did well in my school, however not well enough to get a scholarship for uni. I was rejected countless of times when I applied for numerous scholarships. I wasn't even called for an interview. Many of these scholarships expect me to be almost perfect in both academics and co-curricular activities. However, I was never active in any CCAs as I needed to work, and my grades are only good at best, not excellent.

So basically my cousin had a perfect score and outstanding CCAs. Naturally, he gets numerous offers of prestigious scholarships, with good jobs reserved for him and to choose from in the future. And he gets to go on numerous student exchanges to gain more experience. My aunt is the tai tai sort of the person who spends lavishly on material goods. And since she doesn't need to pay for my cousin's education, she is buying even more expensive things to indulge herself and bringing her whole family for exotic trips frequently. I remembered my mother asking my aunt to loan me money to pay some of my fees so I can work less and focus more on school. However, I remember the way she looked at us in disgust, gave a superficial smile then told us her money is controlled by her husband (my uncle). Since we do not know my uncle very well, my mother requested my aunt if she can ask him to help me. My aunt reluctantly said okay. However, we didn't received any news from her regarding this. Soon, I dropped the idea and find other means.

Luckily, I got financial aid and some loan, which is really a great help for me, but I am troubled by not being able to find a good job or have enough savings next time. Getting a scholarship would really have helped me a lot more.

I am really very saddened by all this. The scholarship selection process is disappointing. It is very lazy and unnecessarily played by the book. Although it has to be fair to all students as long as they are outstanding, they should be more aware of the opportunity cost involved for some students if they do not have a scholarship. But I suppose most of these people who hands out scholarships don't really care whether they are actually helping society (although they claim to be doing philanthropy work), all they want is to give themselves societal recognition or find suitable future employees to profit themselves. I don't blame them for this, since they doing something which makes economic sense for themselves.

I don't expect charity from anyone, but I want people to be more empathetic. A bad student or poor person doesn't mean he is less deserving to be given a chance, even for an interview. Thus I keep telling myself everyday I will help people who are less fortunate than I am. If we don't start shaping society in the image we want it to be, society will shape us into the image it wants us to be, into overly competitive and selfish machines living a cold and meaningless society.

160,"Need some help here. 

I have been with my gf for close to 3 years now and frankly speaking i couldn't ask for a better girl in terms of looks, personality, character and values. But there's just one problem with regards to long term goals. 

You see, I was brought up in a family where there is a lot of emphasis placed on getting good jobs and good income in the future. My parents are holding top positions in reputable companies and they got up there through sheer hardwork and determination. Naturally they have passed on this ""hardworking"" and ""settle for nothing but the best"" traits to me. They aren't overly demanding or anything, but they just expect me to do my best in my studies and hopefully that would translate to good grades, good degree, good job etc. 

The problem is that my gf is nearly totally opposite of me. Where i would be really disappointed with a B+, she would literally jump for joy if she got the same grade. From what i see with the few times i studied with her, she seems like a really laid back person who doesn't really take her studies seriously, not exactly a bo chap attitude but a very low standards kind. She seems to settle with mediocrity and doesn't want to push herself to do better in the future. Her cap is currently in the second lower region and she seems to be content with it. She's already in year 3 but has 0 plans about future job prospects and stuff like that.  I have briefly asked her about whether she wants to work harder to improve her cap, but she casually brushed it off and simply switched to a new convo topic. I didn't want to push it any further after that. 

I know that some people say couples have to compromise for each other, but this is one area where i'm unable to do so as i just cannot see myself simply accepting her low standards. I'm really worried about our long term goals and whether this difference will affect us in the future. Also, my parents do not know her well enough yet to figure  out that she isn't a driven person, but i'm worried there could be problems once they get to understand her better. 

This has been bothering me for quite some time now and i would appreciate if anyone could offer some advice. Thanks.

To one group, I spoke in singlish 

To another, I spoke proper English but with a Singaporean accent

And to the last, I spoke with an AMDK accent

I had never met any of these girls before and the content of my conversation was more or less the same and I dressed the same too. 

When I spoke in singlish, only a small minority were friendly. 

Proper English with Singaporean accent, an even larger number of girls were friendly. 

AMDK accent, an overwhelming majority were shy and seemed attracted. They tried to keep the conversation going and most tried to fake an AMDK accent as well

163,"I feel like face-palming myself when people use NUSwhispers to ask for help on administrative stuff related to school (CORS, SEP, modules, degree related queries).

Although there is a very nice professor here answering students' queries, the correct and fastest channel to ask for help is the school. Drop the relevant department an email/call to get your queries answered and things settled. Bug them and beg them to get your way through. If the department you contacted is not the correct one, I bet they are more than willing to direct you to the correct one. 

I had troubled the school for mapping of modules (CORS and SEP), audit of modules, clash of timetable, internship application and degree requirement and every other random stuff, and our non teaching and teaching staff are always more than helpful.

164,"I honestly don't know what I'm confessing about but I just wish to share my story before the semester starts next week. 

After my break up from a long term relationship, my male friends from my lecture gang who were all single immediately pestered and bugged me to install those dating apps on my phone. Initially I was like -.-. But out of boredom I installed those apps( yes including letterbox) to play around since I realised I had a lot of free time after being single again. Tbh, most of the girls on those dating apps were obviously using fake or heavily photoshopped profiles of themselves as their DP.  Having an ex who had the ability to manipulate make-up and body posture to make herself look more attractive made me more wary of those Super ""chio"" profiles on those dating apps. After a while, I grew disillusioned and uninstalled all of them. 

Anyway, feeling super bored and lonely, I decided to chat up my jc friends (who were all guys) and we went for a drink together at a  restaurant bar. One of them decided that a dick-fest was too boring and decided to ""call in some chicks"". Somehow, from a group of 4 guys, it became a party of 9. One of the girls that came along immediately caught my eye. In my eyes, she was really attractive and maybe perhaps bored being single for a while, I decided to chat her up. I found out afterwards that she was my friend's friend's friend(work that out yourself) 
Long story short, we clicked well and we exchanged numbers before we parted for the night. My guy friends decided to go clubbing with the girls(including her) while I went home to sleep. For those who want to know why I didn't go along , of course I was tempted to follow along to get to know the girl better along the way, but at the same time I was terribly tired and felt a bit sick. 

After that night, I initiated a conversation and things progressed very smoothly for quite some time(Being in a previous Long term relationship really helps one understand girls much better lol). After texting a while, we found out that we really clicked quite well. Importantly, we were the same age and still both studying, me in NUS while she was private Uni. Therefore, somehow, we were able to relate to each other quite well. We started going on one-on-one lunch/dinner dates as well as outings to GBTB and Coney Island just to name a few. We were still unofficial then. After a while, I was sure that it was the right time to confess to her and that I was so confident that she would agree to be my girlfriend. Then one day my friend(who was part of the group that night I met her) dropped me a bombshell. One morning out of the blue he texted me something  along the lines of "" hey bro, I'm so sorry to say this but I can confirm its true, the girl you have been going out with is a social escort""( I altered the actual text as saying it would give away my identity lol). I didn't believe it, I asked for evidence, and immediately he sent me images/screenshots as proof. I shall not discuss the images in detail here as it would be inappropriate. There were other things discussed but I shall stop here. From the evidence he provided, it was impossible for me to deny that she wasn't a social escort. Naturally of course I was extremely heartbroken. It was more painful than rejection. It was the feeling of being ""cuckolded"" or ""戴绿帽”. I took a while to calm down, gather my thoughts, and I called her to meet to talk about something urgent. From her response, I reckoned that she thought I was going to confess to her, since I managed to calm myself down to speak to her in my normal tone. 

We met outside the MRT station. I brought her to a quiet corner since I didn't want anything nasty to happen when I broke the news to her. From her demeanour and expression, I guessed she thought I was going to confess to her lol. (Quiet corner and everything). When I broke the news to her that I found out about her ""job"", her expression immediately changed. It was a very long and emotional talk so to summarise what happened: She said that she was planning to tell me about it once she knew I could be trusted with her secret. She said she had really cut down a lot of her ""work"" after meeting me. She asked me if I still wanted to be with her. She kept apologising and crying. I said I wasn't planning to break up with her at that time I found out. I said that I was heartbroken but I didn't want to end things like that immediately. She cried a lot. 
I immediately felt guilty when I saw that she started crying uncontrollably. That was when I knew I really liked her a lot. Then I made a decision that I don't know whether I will regret in the future. I said something like "" I really like you, and I don't mind what you did in the past, if I ask you to become my Girlfriend, will you become exclusive to me only? That's all I ask for. "" Of course many things were said after that but basically she agreed to be my girlfriend and promised to stop her social escort job immediately. 

Till now, we are still a couple and are going strong. However, there is still a bit of awkwardness between us especially when we try to get intimate. Therefore, our relationship has never progressed beyond normal kissing/hugging /holding hands. Neither of us has suggested to each other about the more ""intimate stuff"" so far.  I am happy with the status quo and I guess she is too.

Personally, I believe that if you really like a person, you would accept him/her despite their past. If they love you, they would willingly change for you too. I believed that she would change for me, so I gave her that chance. To all the singles who are dating, it doesn't matter what your partner did before he/she got together with you. What  matters is what he/she does in the present and in the future. That will be the true gauge of their commitment to you. 

Ps:  I know she often reads NUS whispers. I love you HANNY.
