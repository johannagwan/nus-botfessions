Thank you for the amazing 4 years together. Thank you for making such a long time seem so short. Thank you for embracing me and accepting me. Although we now have to part ways, it has been a wonderful experience. Although we have some bittersweet moments and have times that we would rather not see each other, I have always came back. But this might just be the last time I might be coming back. I have invested far too much time and money on you and my parents would prefer if I stopped. They say that things will always work out but I guess this is the end. Goodbye school, time to move on to adulthood:)

So the thing is, whenever I have to poop, my gf tells me that she wants to look at my product and requests that I send a snap of it to take a look. At first I found it funny to be sending poop pictures like how I did to my close friends just as a joke but it's been going on for a few months now. I tried not telling her that I have to poop but she will scold me and say that I can't be going days without doing my business. 
I really don't want to be taking pictures of my poop anymore it really disturbs me. When I go into her phone and there's a hidden album with all the poop that I sent before. I don't know why she likes these. Can anyone give me advice on how I should deal with this? Or if anyone has been in a similar shitty situation? Thank you

I feel like confessing here because the guilt is eating me alive every night. I can’t believe I did THAT to bring down my cohort peers. Please do not judge me; I’m really here to share my stories. So where should I begin? 

Last semester, I had four finals. I remember I studied till very late and I snack a lot. Like literally a lot. I swear I ate a house full of chips, cookies and some sugary candies. I was so hungry while studying in UTown. I stay in a hall by the way. So what happened was that I had a bad stomachache. I couldn’t unload my faeces naturally. It feels like entering the JB custom - always jammed. The night before my first paper, I did not shit. I hold my shit throughout the examination as I was so stressed and worried for my paper. I silently farted and I think it affected the people around me so badly that they were complaining to the invigilators. I even saw the guy beside me almost vomited by giving an awful expression. It hurts me so bad that my farts are making people around me uncomfortable. I tried my best to hold them but I couldn’t. I kept letting waves of smelly farts during the whole duration of the examination. As a result, some of the people around me did not complete their paper and submitted half-answered paper. I glanced and I saw. I was so remorseful about this. I observed the same trend for the other three papers. I told my best friend after this. She told me it was not my intention and I shouldn’t feel bad about it. As a shy girl always, I don’t know what to do. 

Although my stomach is feeling way better now after the exams, I’m fearful that the same shit will happen again in this new coming semester. I’ve two finals this time round though.

My gf later found out about it and was livid! She said that it was very disrespectful and that I should have asked or informed her first. I didn't think that was necessary because 1) I knew she wouldn't go, 2) she knew all of them and 3) it was no different from hanging out outside. I was just leveraging on a free venue to save costs.

She refuses to talk to me now. Was I really wrong? What should I do???

14,"To OP of #74148. My boyfriend (soon-to-be husband) likes to ask for armpit scratches from me, and subsequently sniffing my fingers. Occasionally he will ask me to take a whiff too. On days when I feel brave, I do. It's funny how when it's your armpit, you can tolerate the smell but if it is other people's armpit, it stinks as hell.

Sometimes, I attempt to catch my fart when it comes out, and hold that space of air and quickly place it near his nose so that he gets the full smelly impact.

I guess, we are two lucky souls who managed to find each other on the same weird wavelength. I can see how to other people, they would find our behaviour awfully weird though. For you, dear OP and your significant other, you'll just need to work out both your tolerance levels for what is weird and what isn't. :)

Benefit of doubt, looking at their reply, I think NUSSU really just wanted to get to know more from students on a more open platform where students can be anonymous (maybe they are really exhausting any means they have haha idk), and the NUSWhispers admin team were just looking out for their viewers (:

Just quite interesting how a small miscom like this can cause so much uproar abt issues like policing, freedom of speech etc, when things were most probably taken out of context, lesson on being aware of fake news/cyber attacking/clarification maybe?

26,"Jumping onto the ""Ok boomer"" bandwagon, I do not think that we millenials and Gen Z collectively are ageist against older people in general. We get along just fine with our grandparents' generation, aka the Silent Generation. You all realize that most of the time when u get into an argument with your boomer parents, your grandparents step in and speak up on your side? The Silent Generation thinks that their boomer children can be disrespectful and entitled too. My mum often talks back rudely to my granddad while inculcating in me the values of respecting your elders since young. I mean, if both your predecessor and successor generations have issues with your generation it means its just your generation and there's really something wrong with it, isn't it?

Made this post after my dad commented that we young people are weak and can never understand the hardship that made boomers tough. My granduncle then savagely dismissed his comment with an ""OK Boomer, what hardship?"" and then proceeded to talk about his childhood experiences of surviving the Japanese occupation, while questioning if the comfortable and peaceful times that my dad went through could even be considered as hard as compared to hiding in canals and living on sweet potatoes. Like a kid made to know his place, my dad was silent for the rest of the family meal.

I had a very weird dream about this girl from my course. It's at a public place, where we coincidentally walked past and had an eye contact, but and she was with another guy, while I'm alone. I was surprised to see her, and when I turned back to look at her again, I saw that they entered either in a restaurant or cafe (I can't really remember it well, since that's not the important part).

As I kept walking, suddenly I felt someone jumping into my back and holding on to me. I turned my head around and noticed she was the one who jumped onto me. After that she suddenly talked to me and brought me to meet the guy she was with. It felt so surreal that the next thing I knew, I woke up feeling weird.

I'm not sure if you know this, but as profound of a thinker as he was, Socrates was a little obscene with his language. I'm guiding my finger over each page, waiting for God to catatonically stop it over a particular phrase that I should be paying attention to. My finger grazes back and forth through a certain page like I'm reading braille when a passage jumps out at me.

Γαμώτο σου. Πιέστε καλύτερα τέσσερις πέντε έξι επτά οκτώ οκτώ κάτω από το λαιμό σας. Δεν υπάρχουν τέσσερις διαφάνειες ανά σελίδα αλλά μία.

I know nothing about ancient Greek, but with the aid of a translator on Google, I received my testaments.

Screw you nerdhead. You better shove lectures four five six seven eight down your throat. Not four slides per page but one.

My past revisions meant shit. Im screwed.

1. Will your boyfriend dance for you for one hour just because you made him breakfast? Will he strum the guitar  while gazing into ur eyes, while singing a love lullaby, just because you helped clean the windows? 

2. Will your boyfriend say “love you” or “saranghaeyo” (the Korean version) daily? 

3. Mosst importantly, your boyfriend may ignore you. He may push you away. He may break up with you, block you on social media, block your calls, and even say to your face “I’m sick and tired of you. We’re broken up, please don’t harass me any more” while maintaining an icy cold glare. 

4. Will a male idol even bother picking fights? Will an idol quarrel with you? Will an idol block you on social media? Will he push you away, accusing you of being “too clingy and irritating” when you fly with him from  airport to airport, from concert to concert? 

5. No, an idol will never reject u or push you away from him. Unlike boyfriends who may get tired if you, an idol will only look at you with sweet puppy eyes and say “I love you”, and croon the sweetest sounding love ballads into your ears (if you have his song in ur phone, u can feel love any time u want!) 

6. And what did I do for my idol in exchange for all the affection? Why, I helped him clean his windows? I helped him wash dishes? No, all I did was to become his fan. 

7. Yeah, all these is fake. Then dating a real boyfriend is real? You sure? Look at the “real” boyfriends pretending to say “I love you forever and ever!” They don’t mean what they say obviously, see how many cheat! See how many abuse their wives and beat them! See how many subject their girlfriends to gaslighting, manipulation, and physical violence! 

8. On the other hand, chasing an idol never subjects you to gaslighting, physical violence, and cheating. Idols are always there for you, whether or not you bother to help them cook, clean and tidy the house.

However, I don't see this as a curse.

I did several temporary jobs. Some of which I did before. It is good to be able to catch up with old colleagues. I also found a girlfriend during one of those temporary jobs.

I was able to go home on time everyday, allowing me to take up new courses and learn new skills, whereas my friends who have full time jobs complain about constant OT.

Whenever my contract for my temporary job end, I give myself a week break before finding another job, whereas my colleague have to wait for the next public holiday just to get that extra one day off.

My girlfriend who works in the hospitality sector told me that certain five - star hotel private dining rooms in the Orchard Road area are often booked for such purpose, for people to interact with other fellow mates of similar socioeconomic status. 

Was wondering if anyone else has heard of this dining club and if they still organise such events. As a sociology grad, this is both amusing and relevant in the broader national conversation on class.

Although I am not very well to do, I try to do the things that show my love for her in more ways than one. Always sending her to and from home, cooking her favourite food and leaving it on her table and tidying up her room when she's asleep. I even went to duplicate a set of keys so that I can clean her house when she isn't free to do so.

100,"Thinking of having children but just can’t trust your man that he won’t meander into another woman’s arms? Here is a practical advice that would pretty much gurantee he won’t deviate cos he risk losing too much. The more he is experienced, the more he will be afraid to lose you. 

If you like a man and you don’t want to lose him, hold on to him using your third hand. For life. 

Pre or post marriage whatever. The cert should hardly matter to you if you find the right man. The strength of your relationship will be determined by your ability to grab and hold him with your third hand.

Forget abt all the preaching of “holy” people who talk so much but in the end are hypocrites with secret affairs behind their “holy” significant other. Nah, I already have it distilled down to a science while people still think sustaining marriage is some kinda wishy washy hoping with faith. 

Guys are like kids that needs to be held by the third hand all the time so that they don’t lose their way. 

Also forget about all the crazy techniques in bed you saw as video and all the nonsense you ever saw or read and thought, ‘that would please a man in bed’. Those are like hollywood action shows, it would be a painstaking effort with little return. 

The only technique in bed that u shd be concerned abt is tightness. You are on the right track when it becomes clear that he would sell his soul to live another day with you on earth. Doesn’t matter how experienced he is before he met you.

Jade pigeon eggs. 

Your ancestors can thank me later. I need all the positive karma I can get to meet my wife the next life too. 

-from a guy happily married to a wife for ten years with a kid and have literally zero interest in any other woman. All that confidence. All freaking plastic bags.

103,"Why does he love me? 

I would be fooling myself if I said, because he can appreciate my ""essential being"". Maybe that is a tad idealistic. Kind? Humorous? Beautiful? That is not unique to me, and I can easily be swapped out for someone else. 

This is the internal thought process of a non-feminist young woman in campus, who does not condone sex early on in a relationship. Kindly follow my line of reasoning. 

Repeating the question, which is very simple, 
What is the basis for his love? Because me loving him is not enough, he has to value me too, or else I won't be happy! 

Many romantics believe, love is blind, love is irrational. No wonder there is also a term such as hopeless romantic, which indicate a sense of letdown by reality. 

In most cases, the natural instinct of the opposite gender is to rush into sex, unless he is irrationally noble. There is a frenetic sexual energy at this age where nothing but biology is to blame. 

Do you love yourself, or do you seek validation from instagram likes and size of following to prove your social value based on a painstakingly curated glory hole constituting of vacation photos and perceived popularity? If that is the case, do I attribute his love to my parents for funding my life (and my phone to access instagram)? 

What is your identity? Do you believe yourself to be smart? Do you think of yourself as creative? Do you see yourself as strong? Or special in some inexplicable way? 

Does he see that? 
What tangible things do you have to show for yourself? 

Has he had many long drawn out, thoughtful discussions to know you on a mental level? No? Yeah, who has time for that anyway? We are all living alone on our own for the first time, in most cases, and we need instant remedy for our loneliness and neediness. 

To cut the long story short, we could possibly just be another random person without deep, meaningful and specific contextual relevance to them. All you have to offer him is sexual favors. That might be the reality. And you are better off abstaining than to be an unpaid worker. 

So cultivate some self-worth, individuality and focus on personal growth and achievement, rather than investing emotional energy into a gutter, through laying your insecure, eager to please/accommodating self at their mercy when they leave you feeling ""abandoned"" and worse than where you started. Ain't worth it. Save yourself the unnecessary heartache/drama.

Girls are always craving food, thinking of food, and finding new cafes to try. Girls always say they love to eat! But when they do eat, they say their appetite is small, and ask males to help finish because males supposedly have bigger appetites? 

But males, whose stomachs can finish so much food, don’t “love” food! They don’t care about what they eat, they are not enthusiastic about trying new food, and they don’t even go dessert shops to share cake! 

If men can eat so much, why don’t they say they love food? shouldn’t they be the ones always eating candy, chocolate, cake, and ice cream all the time?

Girls always say they love food and have cravings, yet they are the ones who say “but girl cannot eat much what”.

Back in secondary 1, my classmates were into making class t-shirts for everyone.

Normally, people would decide on choosing their class registration number i.e. 1 to 40.

But for me, I just thought of having the number '69' at the back of my class t-shirt. Back then, I found the number to be so elegant. It was like Ying and Yang merged together.

There’s always that few students that hog the floor by asking and voicing their opinion every 5mins, which: prevents other students from getting their chance to participate, and causes the lecture to extend another 20-30mins. 

There’s also those that participate for the sake of participating by asking non-relevant questions, like “oh what do you mean can you elaborate” or “I disagree but I can’t explain why”.

148,"Why do girls think guys should make the first move, and if they don’t, get a stamp on the face smack center that “guys r really dumb- giving subtle hints like crazy also dun get it”? Do guys deserve such short sighted judgement, if you think of all the teasing sg gals pepper on guys? 

Consider the following scenarios. Tell me why this would mean it is a hint for the guy to confess since gal is interested. 

1. Gal chats with guy everyday. Have lunch, meet for movies and find nice places to eat. Meets on weekend, even goes to ECP. 
2. Gal drops by abruptly out of nowhere, say hi and infront of ppl she dunno, she suddently squeeze into the coffee table to do small chats with that guy only, literally kicks all other convo with his friend out of the window and it is all about her feelings, then abruptly say she buy and leaves - but after presentinf little gifts for him- but not handmade. Same Gal tell the guy lets go watch a movie together in front of everyone but takes 100 messages just to pin down a day for the movie, which turns into a breakfast lunch dinner movie time that gets cancelled several times with more apologies and more small gifts. 
3. Gal makes handmade cookies and gives guy regularly. Many times the cookies are heart shaped. She does not appear to cook specifically for the guy, but gives the impression she does. She seems not to realise that it is possible to peek into her bag when she takes out her cookies to see more cookies in there, nicely wrapped. 
4. Gal calls up guy for lunch almost every day, but cancels regularly, saying got this guy with Ferrari want to buy her lunch, but he keep canceling. 
5. Gal who regularly meet for lunch suddenly confides about how her finances are in trouble because an “unknown” sponsor only gives her $1,000 a month and she cannot afford to go on studying like that and was wondering if the guy can chip in another $1,000. 
6. Gal sees guy in a bus stop opposite, walk over just to say hi, small chats and even takes the bus to an MRT in the opposite direction saying she got time. But till now still haven’t exchanged numbers. 

Well let me tell you: NONE of these girls are dropping hints to start a relationship. They are just trying out stunts to see if they can elicit some kinda response from a guy, anywhere from “hey, can I meet you again” to “baby, I can’t stop time but I can stop you from leaving”, only to shove a power move called *WTF-blush-and-nevertalktomeagain-kthxbye,next* move. 

So what does guy do? “Well that was fun. Another time. Cheers!” ... and maybe she will msg again, maybe not. 

I know how this works because... not to be flexing but I always had girls lining up to pick from, but I know they are all just doing their 어장관리. I am fine with that. Having lunch with nicely dolled up gals is always a better deal than eating alone. 

Let me lazer in here for the guys on how to know yr gal got some feeling. 

Here is the thing: money talks. If a girls buys the meal, she is interested in you, and if u want to confess, she may or may not reject but she won’t do a ego trip on power play to hurt you, and the friendship can continue as if the confession did not happen (but dun ever confess again, although she will confess if she wants later on, maybe long after). Reason being that gals will NEVER spend money on a guy who they have zero feelings for. You cannot guilt trip a gal to spend money on you. She will spend money on you because she likes you. Maybe not enough to start a relationship possibly, but definitely enough to care for your ego being broken if you confess. If she writes love poem or make handmade origami with something written in it and lots of heart sign, that is not hint alr its confession hor, even if the content is only abt the weather or poem like “mice loves rice like I love u”. 

Ah yes, I forgot. If you don’t have girls lining up to have lunch with you, please ignore this post and study hard for level 1 pak-tor modules, this is level 4 module tips on choosing girl to BTO. 

Btw just to clear the air on getting a BTO: if u r from a really rich family, u will be forced to get a HDB by yr parents so as to learn to live humbly AND so that money does not poison their grand children or yr wife. So stop being so shallow and write off everyone in HDB as ppl who can’t afford condos. I could pay the downpayment for a condo just by saving up my allowance for a couple of months. Yeah I take bus 95 like the rest of you and don’t waste money on depreciating asset like cars even when I can afford an X5, because having money to burn does not mean you should burn it.

149,"Imagine this: Your first date last night went well. The two of you began the date as strangers, but left holding hands like a couple on honeymoon. Perhaps the two of you went on to do other things typical of couples on honeymoon, things which the said couple will only begin to regret some nine months later. Its ok: We are a judgement-free community here at NUSWhispers. Whatever happened last night, it is a new morning now, which means it is time to plan for the next date! 

Resist the urge to text back immediately. From previous posts on NUSWhispers, you should be familiar the secret of baby powder and friendship bracelets. Don't let the beeping of his phone spoil the magic moment as your guy wakes up drunk on the strangely familiar yet intoxicating scent of baby powder and the lingering memory of your smooth and supple hands gliding up and down and up and down and up and down... your friendship bracelet. Give him time. He will text you first. 

While you wait for the guy to text back, I recommend that you ransack your cupboard/storeroom for an important yet underappreciated item: the JC hoodie. Poly and Uni hoodies are NOT an acceptable substitute. What to do with the JC Hoodie follows many of the principles set out in the baby powder and friendship bracelet posts. 

1. Recall that baby powder seeks to subconsciously evoke the image of babies and hence babymaking.  In a similar manner, the JC hoodie seeks to subconsciously evoke the memory of your date's first (serious) crush. At this stage, you have no idea whether your date's crush is the school valedictorian or the head cheerleader, a catholic schoolgirl or a foul-mouthed lian. It dosen't matter. Just wear the JC hoodie on the second date, and follow his gaze as he mentally undresses you. Let his eyes tell you all about his first crush, and it will be obvious how you should continue. 

2. Like the friendship bracelet, the JC hoodie is an excellent conversation starter: By talking about the friendship bracelet on the first date, and the JC hoodie on the second, you ensure that your date's gaze remains transfixed on some part of your body. Leave all the meaningful conversations about hopes, dreams and values to your friendzone. Remember: This is a date. Your favorite bible passage is 2 Samuel Chapter 13. 

3. Like the friendship bracelet, the JC Hoodie helps you to initiate physical contact. Recall that when you play with your friendship bracelet, the movement of your hands across the bracelet hint to your date how you want to touch him. When you play with your JC hoodie, the movement of the sleeves on the hoodie hint to your date how you want him to touch you. 

Hence, on your second date, start with the hoodie fully zipped up, but gradually unzip as the day progresses. Find an excuse under the hot singaporean sun to give your date the pleasure of taking it off. When sitting down for dinner, wrap the hoodie around your butt, your lap, your waist, your breast, your shoulders. Cover all your sensitive spots with the hoodie, or alternatively cover everything but your sensitive spots. Let both of your imaginations run wild.  

Above all, remember that the texture of the hoodie is different from the texture of normal clothes, which is different from the texture of lingerie, which is different from the texture of bare skin. Educate your date on the subtle differences between each of these. Let him learn to recognize each by touch. Let him learn your language of love. Let him be the first to say ""I love you"".

Last Monday at around noon, was at Novena Square2 Koufu foodcourt when I saw this cute girl around 160cm tall. Was starving so brushed it aside and went to buy lunch. My food was ready but couldn't find any empty seats except the table she was at, so asked her if she'd mind me joining. Good thing she didn't and I happily sat down diagonally opposite her (personal space right?) We were both minding our own business, but it felt like there's a spark when we exchanged glances. Wanted to strike up convo numerous times, but the shy me didn't muster enough courage for fear of embarrassment should she be attached. Sadly, she left while I was taking a call and missed the chance to get her number..

156,"Imagine you are on a dinner date tonight. You have already chosen your outfit, done up your makeup and put on just a hint of baby powder as recommended in a recent NUSWhispers post. Are you ready yet? Not quite.

Go to your toys drawer and dig out the friendship bracelet that your bestie gave you way back in primary school and wear it. Don't worry, your bestie will forgive you for the terrible things that you will be doing with it in the next few hours :) Why, you ask? Three reasons:  


1. Friendship bracelets are sexy. 

Lets face it: Dates are awkward, especially during the ""twilight zone"" when your order has been taken and there is nothing to do but sit and wait for the food to arrive. There might be some light conversation at this stage, but no guy really cares about your favorite color or whether you are a dog person. Instead, I am 100% certain that the guy will be checking you out. All that separates men from boys is how well they are able to hide their gaze.

If you are lucky enough to be one of those ""genetically blessed"" girls, then this is the best time to flaunt it. In any case, it won't hurt your chances to play with the bracelet. Grope it. Caress it. Touch it.  Imagine that the ridges on the bracelet are the ridges on a guy's manhood, and show the guy that you know how to take care of it. Remember: to the untrained eye, all you are doing is playing with a bracelet, but in reality you are subconsciously signalling an intoxicating mix of innocence and sex appeal.  What you do NOT want to do is to sit straight with hands by the side like an Egyptian mummy, or hands on the table in the classic ""interviewer"" pose ... unless, of course, you are 100% certain that you guy is into that kind of kinky roleplay.   


2. Friendship bracelets are the perfect conversation starter. 

Once all the standard ""interview"" questions have been asked, you need to take the initiative to steer the conversation in a more intimate direction. I assume that by now, the typical guy has finished estimating your boob size and has started to notice the rest of your person-ality, i.e. the friendship bracelet that you keep playing with. 

Since you know you are being checked out anyway, I think it is a pity to diffuse the sexual tension by talking about boring topics like work. Instead, you can start talking about the friendship bracelet in order to organically start a conversation while keeping your guy's visual gaze fixed on your hands. For example, a conversation might go:

""Hey, I see that you noticed my friendship bracelet. Do you like it? My friend gave it to me during church camp...""

Then, depending on how your date responses, you can follow up with either

""Wow, it is so nice to meet a fellow christian!!! Yes, religion is important to me. My favorite christian values are chastity and honesty and my favorite christian verse is 2 Samuel chapter 13!!"" OR

""Want to hear about the naked pillow fights in the girls dorm during church camp?""

And so the ""deep conversation"" continues...

3. Friendship bracelets initiate skin contact. 

Since you have been playing with your friendship bracelet all day and talked about it incessantly throughout the night, it is mind-blowingly easy to initiate skin contact.

...
...
...

""Do you want to touch my bracelet?""

...
...
...

At this point, your hands are hopefully smooth and fragrant like a powdered baby butt.

Best of luck in your future dates :) Remember: If the date dosen't go well, you can just give the friendship bracelet to your date. He should get the message....

159,"Do you think there are ghosts? Let me tell you a story. 

I used to organize weekend camps for Sunday schools. Me being very passionate about making the camp exciting to these elementary kids, I resorted to building a haunted house experience for them, themed “the power of one”. Basically at least one person will go in and bring a key out to unlock lots of goodies (snacks etc) locked in a huge bag. Unlimited tries, max three per group. 

There was a run-down bungalow near the venue which the camp was held and I had carefully set up many stations of “scare” which would give the kids chills and make the goodies very rewarding. My friend was supposed to be the white “ghost” to appear behind the main door to shut the door and I was the “black” ghost that would appear behind a pail of murky water in which the kids must dip their hand and collect a key to unlock the goodies for the whole camp. 

Unexpectedly it was a big hit and all the kids had good fun screaming their head off (no nearby residential unit, we rented the whole campsite) and tell everyone how scary it was. 

I asked which ghost was scarier, the white or the black one. 

They replied and I could not gather enough courage to bring back the pail and other mockup items the next day from that dilapidated bungalow. 

The kids said: “the red ghost! It was foaming blood from mouth and looked so furious with red eyes!! Was really hard to ignore! We almost gave up!”

160,"It makes me FURIOUS that many of my fellow babes don't know the secret weapon to attract guys.

I present to you: Johnson & Johnson Baby Powder. Dab some of it on yourself before going out. Use enough such that you can just barely smell the baby powder beneath whatever other products you may be using. Also consider carrying a small bottle of baby powder on your person so that you can apply more as necessary.  

Why is baby powder super effective? three reasons:

1. Baby powder smells good. Its scent is mild, neutral and inoffensive, complementing any feminine odors that you may produce. When accidents happen, baby powder is a girl's best friend. 

2. Baby powder is sexy. The scent of baby powder makes guys subconsciously think of babies, and all guys know how babies are made. Regardless of whether the your target is a horny schoolboy with an oedipus complex, a salaryman looking to start a family or a tiko uncle with an underage fetish, it is undeniable that baby powder has a mass appeal that is unrivaled by any other product. 

3. Baby powder has deniability. Things can get ugly if a girl smells another girl's perfume on her man. On the other hand, the smell of baby powder elicits a response of ""Wow, my man takes such good care of our kids. He is such a good husband and father"". 

Best of luck in the upcoming semester :) Just remember to use protection, otherwise the baby powder that you bought will end up being used for its original purpose.

I have always been an OG since secondary school. And when I heard that the company was conducting an orientation for my first day of work, oh boy, was I excited!
On my first day, I showed up in my oversized class t shirt and shorts and brought my sleeping bag. I was aghast to see everyone in formal wear. I am like, ""you guys will be in such a rude surprise when we do water activities.""
Then, this lady showed up and asked for my name. I said, ""Ah, you must be our OG."" She said, ""no, I'm Linda from HR.""  
And then when we were all gathered, I was really disheartened that we just introduced our names and the departments we were going to be working in. I mean, where were the blow wind blow and 2 truths and 1 lie icebreaker games? Where were the forfeits? This was a very lacklustre work from Linda as an OG. 
Linda showed me to my desk. She just gave it to me. It really pissed me off. I am like, ""What? No cheer? In my time, we had to cheer for every single thing even for our food. How can you give me anything without using cheer as a form of currency!?"" She said something about this is being a corporate company or whatever. 
I was really excited for the day to the end. And yet again, I was disappointed. Everyone just packed up their stuff and left at 6pm. We didn't stay over. Then, how else can we bond if we don't bring our sleeping bags and sleep along the corridors of our office!?

China has reached a new high of 1.19 vs 1 female for newborn.
That may not mean much but think carefully how many people are in China. That number is so huge, it will completely change the dating game as you know it.

Correct me if I am wrong, but that means that girls will have less trouble finding a guy and guys will have a harder time finding a girl to marry, by about nearly 20% in difference in twenty year's time.

So right now, whatever stress you are feeling as a guy, it is nothing when the younger masses come and screw you up, trying to date girls REGARDLESS OF AGE as long as she is single and can reproduce (yes, Chinese culture = purpose of marriage = progeny must be same DNA).

For girls, whatever princess you are, you'd better settle down because in 20 years time, if you are still single be prepared for an onslaught of babies born this year trying to date you and take them seriously as a man. Btw, they will have a lot less economical power to flex because the world's $$ pie would have become even smaller.

Clean up this mess of a dating game because the next generation of dating will feel like it is being weaponized compared to this fwb whatever flipflop lifestyle testing water-kinda dating singles are flexing now.

But a few weeks ago I witnessed the most bizarre scene. I was sitting in an mrt that was pretty much empty. There were seats everywhere. Then two old people entered the mrt and started rushing for the same reserved mrt seat.

The old lady managed to reach the seat first and sat down. The old man was super annoyed and was like 'I'm a senior citizen you know! I have card I can show you!'.

The old lady then replied 'I also senior citizen! I also have card u want see?'. Then they just glared at each other for a long moment. Eventually the old man begrudgingly went to another reserved seat.

I just found all of this hilarious. There are seats all around us, why fight over one reserved seat? Plus why does the old man have to walk all the way to the other reserved seat instead of just taking a normal seat?

However, she said she did not see a future between us because she was 5’10” and I was only 5’6”. 

Well, obviously I was quite annoyed even though I was half-expecting this (our social standing is rather different, and I admit my own lack of self-development and confident played a big role, besides my height, or in this case my lack thereof) because I thought her personality should have been quite cool and that she wouldn’t be so fixated on our height difference.

While I now realise this was just an excuse she was giving and she wasn’t really so shallow as to reject someone purely on the basis of height, I couldn’t restrain myself at the time and angrily asked her, “What the hell? You’re rejecting me just because you are a bit taller than me? Don’t be so bloody full of yourself! You’re only 4 inches taller than me! 4 inches is so bloody short it might as well be nothing! 4 INCHES IS NOTHING!!!!”

After I said that, I was a bit disappointed with myself for having been slightly less composed than I should have been instead of taking rejecting in a calm and mature fashion, and got into a mood that can only be characterised by an overwhelming feeling of disgust and self-loathing. But the more I think about it, in the love context, while 4 inches is actually a negligible height gap, it can also be a reasonable length? Now I have conflicting thoughts on this matter...

What is your opinion, fellow denizens of NUSWhispers? Is 4 inches #perfectlyfine ?

Some even have mild fragrances so now mine smell ... like my gf's.

Another thing I found out after living with a woman: lotions. My skin is now silky smooth and I smell like a walking bouquet of flowers. It helped that I moved to a country with dry winters. Without lotion, the winter is absolute hell: your skin dries out and you get itchy the whole time.

Combe Incorporated produces Vagisil advertised to women, and hair dyes for men. You really screwed us over. You could have saved millions of men from being called stinky if you advertised ""Penisil"" or something.

Like many SoC students who did not fit into Orbital vacancies, I'm doing software development (android app) independently during the break. My app is technically more difficult compared to my friend's ""Apollo 11"" app (he's just clearing the min requirements). The difference is that I will not be getting any MCs, prizes or official recognition for my app.

I'm wondering why Orbital participation leads to a higher chance for getting selected for NOC? Does the selection committee look out for ""Orbital/Vostok/Apollo 11/ Gemini"" to determine if an applicant is legit? If that is true, what can a non-Orbital participant do to get an equal shot at NOC?

220,"Since there are so many posts about foreign girls and sg girls let me shed some light on between them. Sg girls like to automatically assume that guys are interested in them when guys approach or talk to them. Foreign girls are opposite. They will assume neutral stance and put necessary effort to keep the conversation going, while appreciating the effort from the guy for the first move. They would be more open minded but still cautious and amicable. Unless the guy back out, she will still be there to talk to. Unlike the usual sg girl who would play hard to get, pretend never read message, act busy and assume guys should make them feel interested. 

Im sure many guys who have experienced this before some random girls who they find cute at first but after making the first move (which they lacked of skills to make guys interested to continue) they can simply use the 3 words “im not interested” like as if the guy is very interested in them in the first place. It is not just rude but how disgusting they place themselves on a pedestal. Then blame the guy cannot take a “rejection” or behave like kid if we tell them off about it. What a joke. If we didnt tell them then they will continue to live in their own world. Most guys are just trying to see if a conversation can be continued but the sg girl would assume they are some prize trophy waiting for someone worthy to claim. To think of it even if the guy is worthy why would he want a girl with such attitude. It is a trick to see their true character. 

Another scenario guys can be familiar with. When u go clubbing if u managed to talk to some sg girls and they come to your table, after drinking your drinks they will just sit there and do nothing with a poker face or rather waiting for the guys to entertain them instead. To make things uglier they will go away to mingle with others and then return back when they need your drinks or cannot find any others more fun out there. For foreign girls needless to say they will be there and not behave so cheapskate. Foreign girls have better eq and they can have all character brains and looks at the same time. For sg girls only can only have one or two at most. 

In overseas when u happen to see a IT female promoter dressed in a model type of skimpy outfit they can promote the products at the same time using the microphones alone. In sg we will need another emcee to do the promoting and the girl just stand there for show. 

I think sg guys should look for a better alternative and stop being insulated in our own sg girls cos they are definitely over priced or lagging in terms of character from the rest of the world. Many seniors have also advise me that. I think it is true and getting worst as the time goes by.

I agree with those who said that we deserve the shoes, t-shirts, shorts etc. that we earn from our 2 years of service. I myself do wear them occasionally (not necessarily to school).

Maybe I didn't go into enough details in my previous post about what I meant about ""army culture"". I think for me, one of the more specific examples of ""army culture"" that stood out was when the project director of the event (which I shall not name here) shouted ""ten, nine, eight, ..., three, two, one"" He was trying to get us to get to where we should be for that activity within the time limit.

A friend once transferred a month of fitness class subscription to me which I have wanted to try but unable to afford then. I have intention to return this big favour to him too. I know he would not accept actual price payment* or some friendship price so I decided to do it in a jokingly way. I took photos of me in stupid funny pose during each workout such as flexing my mini muscle, showing my butt, showing my fat tummy. At the end of the month, I thanked him for letting me try out those fitness routines and offered to buy him a lunch for that while sending those photos inbetween the conversation haha. Seeing those photos made him cursed me out, but in a friendly manner and we both had a good laugh over it. The lunch treat happened and concluded with the food choice to his liking, pricing to my comfort and us TCSS over the lunch. We both considered the favour has been returned in our heart.

You pointed out receiving 70/100 dollars meal plan as a big favour, maybe you are having financial difficulties just like me then and there is a possibility that your friend might see the 70/100 dollars lunch treat as a burden to your financial situation instead, thus refused it. Don't worry about that and don't think so much since you have now decided to go ahead with the drink treats to return the favour. Spend your brain cells on the drink sessions and do your best making her feel happy during each session. To me, a 70/100 cents cup of kopi with friends and smiles along the way tastes much better than an expensive cup of kopi without a moment of joy. Perhaps you can also rate the top 3 of the 14 meals you received and bring her to eat there. I believe the individual meal pricing should be within the comfort level of your and her for a lunch treat.

May you have a long lasting friendship with her! Happy weekend!

238,"In the recent debate about dating foreign girls, the thing is just like anyone from any country, there are going to be pros and cons. Its really just about your personal preferences. Being the level 99 love guru that I am, let me break it down for you kids.

Dating a singaporean girl
pros:

-she probably earns as much as you do, and she has cpf as well. So she can pay 50-50% for your HDB or your future kid's university fees. 

-contrary to popular belief, sg girls are really not that materialistic. They earn as much as you and can pay for their own stuff really. If you are dating a Siam Bu, you will need to give her $1k per month for her grandmother's neighbor's dog's hospital bills or something.

cons:

-after watching too much Disney films when she was a kid, too much Korean dramas in her teens. Worse of all, being spoiled rotten by her parents, she expects to be treated like a princess. Sg girl: why you dont go Jewel tabao A&W at 1am to my house for me when i hungry? you dont love me anymore right?!

-she cant cook or clean to save her life. Guys if you cant afford a maid, then you ARE the maid.

Dating a singaporean boy
pros:

-he probably earns as much as you do, and he has cpf as well. So he can pay 50-50% for your HDB or your future kid's university fees. If you are lucky maybe someday he will be rich, if not well at least you wont be poor.

-Sg mothers taught their sons well. He will not insult or physically hurt you. You will be surprised that some foreign men think its normal to abuse women. 

cons:

-Childish and immature. Similar to sg girls, sg boys are sheltered by their parents until the point they cant even plan a decent overseas trip themselves. All they seem to be good at doing is being addicted to their video games and mobile phones. Only knows how to bring you to Swensens or jack's place every single anniversary until the day you die.

-He will probably cheat on you with some Siam Bu or KTV hostess someday. Pro tip: singaporeans hardly use Wechat or Line, so if he is spending alot of line on these apps, you may wana check his phone

241,"Regarding the “guy pay for meal” topic, I think everyone is missing the point. The anguish is NOT on whether guy should pay or should not pay. Instead, the anguish is about the mismatched attitude from girl. Allow me to explain what I mean. 

There are 2 types of guys, and each of them have their own advantages and disadvantages:

1. Guys who pay majority of expenses (aka. Traditional guys)

Advantage - pay for girls (be it meal, flight, hotel, diamond right, wedding etc) because he feels he is the man and he should provide security and it is manly and gentlemanly to do all these things.

Disadvantage - tend to be more bossy and demand obedience from girls. Also expect the girl to cook and do household chores, run the family while he work. Take care of kids and parents. 

The grounding for this type of guy is chivalry. He will protect his girl fiercely and shelter her relentlessly, but also expect girl to listen to him, be demure and be his helper and take care of the family.

2. Guys who split half half (aka modern guys)

Advantage - doesn’t expect girl to take care of family solely. Will share the burden of work. Emphasis gender equality, less authoritative. Woman have more say in decision making. 

Disadvantage - Portrayed as “not man” enough. Not gentlemanly. Deemed to be calculative (eg. Dispute over who pay meal), 小心眼, 不大气 and 小男人 (aka insecure man). 

The grounding for this type of guys is fairness and equality. He will treat his girl fairly with justice, yearn to build a collaborative and team oriented family with no hierarchy. But he will also never ever shortchange himself which can be seen as petty, uncaring, unpampering to the girl. 

I’m ok with both types of guys. The KEY is that they have both pro and cons. Neither is better than the other and it all boils down to your preference. 

However the disaster and anguish occur when female (especially Singaporean girls) have fantasy expectation of boyfriend, which is simply taking the advantageous points of both types of guy and forbid the disadvantage points:

Fictional boyfriend that sg girls expect:

pay for girls (be it meal, flight, hotel, diamond right, wedding etc) because he feels he is the man and he should provide security and it is manly and gentlemanly to do all these things.

doesn’t expect girl to take care of family solely. Will share the burden of work. Emphasis gender equality, less authoritative. Woman have more say in decision making. 

CANNOT BE bossy and demand obedience from girls. Also CANNOT expect the girl to cook and do household chores, run the family while he work. Take care of kids and parents. 

CANNOT BE portrayed as “not man” enough or not gentlemanly. CANNOT be calculative (eg. Dispute over who pay meal), 小心眼, 不大气 and 小男人 (aka insecure man). 

And what’s gonna be the guy’s grounding in this case? It’s obvious... Treat my girl as a goddess and do whatever to please her, let her extract and exploit me all in the name orb love. Aka. Be her slave! 

I think that’s the crux of the resentment and anguish: girls wanting to eat the cake and have it at the same time. Selectively picking for good points and criticize bad points without realizing all the pro and cons come as a package. 

When she has a traditional guy, she compare the traditional guy’s disadvantage to a modern’s advantage (taking the traditional guy’s advantage for granted and oblivious to the modern guy’s disadvantage.) 

So there you go... TLDR: Crux of the problem is girls having fictional fantasy of imaginary boyfriend material! 

But fret not guys.. once girl hit 30, they will grow up and wake up from their fantasy and the table will turn :)

242,"You guys debating about who should pay what hor make me think about creating an app.

Take a pic before eating, post on Instagram, designate every single food item partitioned by the image processor to the person consuming it. Enter each food item’s pricing. Then I’ll help you derive your exact % of the bill to pay. 

In the pipeline, I want to do real-time image processing also. Then you don’t have to enter anything.

So next time hor, when you eat cai fan, if your partner steals a piece of meat or veg or carbs from your plate, that amount is charged to his/her bill.

To simplify it even more, you’ll then have to link your mobile wallet or bank account to include direct debit! No more worries about blind dates or actual dates for who pay what.

243,"So here is my situation, I had a really heavy lunch before I went for my job interview at a start-up company and the interviewer basically showed me around their office and their 'awesome' pantry laid with snacks and drinks. She offered me to take one beer and snack, which I declined as I brought my own water. After the interview, she asked again if I wish to take from their 'awesome' pantry again, which I again politely declined, she looks a bit disappointed though, so just curious is it considered rude to decline a drink/snack during an interview?

260,"It's my first time to be on NUSWhispers, I just found the page quite funny sometimes, so I guess as my uni life has been quite boring, I just wanna share a story here. I'm actually a quite timid girl but I stay positive all the time. I came out from poly, started school when the other girls were all younger than me, they looked young, fresh, humorous and attractive while I was just very ordinary. I like doing things alone. I was quiet all the time in school friends' conversations and people never really remembered me. I realized maybe I was not as attractive as other girls, but it's just fine because I'm happy with who I am. During weekend, as I stay on campus, I usually go to YIH comp lab to study, I enjoy the place so much because I actually feel uncomfortable to be in crowded places like Utown. One day, while I was napping on the table (because I'm doing internship concurrently, I'm really lack of sleep), there was suddenly a guy coming in and somehow that woke me up but I wasn't totally awaken. He asked where the printing station was, and as I was just awake, I really looked silly and you know, I was just acting with my silly face, showing him to check the room next door. Apparently the photocopy room closed long time ago (omg I realized it was a wrong direction), then he came back and told me he didn't find it. So I looked around (I must look very weird at that time I guess), and showed him to check the other comp lab near the toilet. I was waiting outside while he stepped into the room and then luckily the printers were there (okay, now I know where the printers are). He was printing but then looked at me outside the door and smiled with a hand signal like ""it's ok now"". Just like that, he then came back to the lab I was sitting, said thank you and sorry for disturbing my sleep but I just felt embarrassed because even my friends never saw me sleeping or napping before as well. But it's fine until I accidentally bump to him the second time in YIH while ordering food. I don't know why he remembered me and smiled to me. I also remember him but I was just embarrassed so I passed by him very quickly. Then I realized I forgot my drink (omg why I forgot my drink) and came back to the shop where he was sitting nearby. This time I stopped and tried my best to say ""we met... uhm, the printers..., right?"". He smiled and said ""yes, the printers"". After that, I didn't know why but I felt happy because that was the first time someone actually remembered me, a very ordinary, timid, and sound-boring person like me. Again the day before, it's so happening that, I saw him again, that time I was trying my best to actually follow and hope to talk to him again but he was just walking so fast with his friends. I missed him among the crowd... 
""Hi, my first time here and my first time doing this kind of confession. I don't even know your name, your major or anything about you but just want to thank for remembering me. I might look cold and quiet, but I'm not a unfriendly person. So, if there is ever a chance that we meet again, I think I would really ask your name. Jiayous for finals and see you around (hopefully)!""

261,"After going for ICT and coming back, I've noticed that each clique or project group has a certain structure, especially if it's made up of (mostly)guys. You'll always have one or more of these people.

1. The Platoon Commander
He takes charge of the group, initiating ideas, study sessions, coordinates outings... You can always depend on him to take the lead on anything, and everyone just seems to go along with it, because it always works out in the end with him. Might also take the lion's share of the work because ""it needs to be done"" and ""Aiya easier for me to do than disturb you all"". Bonus points if he wears his OCS singlet to school or tells a shit ton of ""in my time"" stories.

2. The Platoon Sergeant
He'll be the first to voice concerns and take the lead when the PC is not around. Usually found alone if not with the group, though he fits right in when he's there. Often takes on more than the rest because he believes in leading by example and challenging himself. Might take on extra stuff to add badges to his uniform, like exchanges, double degrees or whatnot. Sometimes bites off more than he can chew and finds himself regretting it in a classic oh shit moment.

3. The Section Commanders
Usually particularly good at one thing, or maybe not really good at many things, but they still try. May make life hard for the PS when they do prove him wrong or put up differing ideas and opinions. Usually found either doing work at the last minute after procrastinating but somehow manages to get it done decently well, or being the first to jump on a major assignment so they can be choose their parts and be done with it then watch the rest suffer through the harder parts. Bonus points if they gossip about the PC and PS among themselves or often go off to take a nap.

4. The Section Members
Sometimes there when things happen, sometimes missing in action, but unfortunately mostly there to tank the saikang. Usually don't say anything and don't contribute much to decisions... But still kena when it comes to doing the work. Bonus points for wearing army tees out, or leaving group messages on ""read"". 

5. The Chao Keng
Never there when you need him. Shows up after all the work and comes up with a million excuses not to do work or contribute. Won't take the saikang, won't be there to clean up, he's the last in but first out. Bonus points if everyone secretly hates him, but is too nice to tell it to his face.

6. The Warrant Officer
Might be your age, but sure talks like he's 50 years old. He does his fair share, but unfortunately that's all he does. Disappears after, and is rarely seen after five. Intentionally schedules all his classes together so he can pang gang earlier. Nobody knows anything about him, he just comes to school, does his part, gets stuff straight and goes home.

7. The Attached-Out Personnel
He's not really part of your clique anymore. He used to show up regularly, but not any more and he's more of a work friend than a real friend by now. Usually has his own group of friends on the side, which he's now ""attached"" to. He doesn't make an effort to meet you guys but you guys are still good. Still shows up to go out sometimes, but usually leaves jios on read or flies aeroplane on you guys. Bonus points if he's dating someone in the new group of friends. 

And the shiny pokemon...

8. The AWOL
You never know where he is, you never know what he's doing, and he doesn't even read, let alone reply, text messages. He just went home one day and that was the last you heard of him. You only intermittently hear of him appearing somewhere or you only see an empty seat during finals. Bonus points if he somehow manages to be still on the nominal row the next semester and you're just wondering how he's not slapped with an academic warning yet.

You might be one of them, you might be more than one of them, or you might be none of them. The only constant you know is that no matter what course you're in, you're going to hear about at least one Chao Keng.

If you don't, then I've got bad news for you.

262,"I became sexually active with my girlfriend two years ago. Prior to that her periods were very irregular (intervals of months), and very light (lasting less than one day with very little bleeding). She was actually very happy in that state, being able to avoid the cramps that other girls regularly suffer.

However after being sexually active for a few months, her periods became more and more regular, and heavier and heavier (last time, it lasted 5 days).

There have been studies done in the 70s that observed correlations between sexual activity and period regularity, but many websites seem to poorly informed about that.

So, we're a living sample that it's causal! So don't worry too much about period regularity yet, especially if you're a virgin.

So earlier today, I got this call from a company which I interviewed with for their marketing role a few months back.

THEY WERE FUUUUUUURIOUS! Here's the story.

I'm still taking my Degree so I don't have much to show in my resume (except for having a direct mentorship/collab with some of the marketing personalities/giants around the world) compared to other candidates and a strong freelance portfolio.

BUT then again, I do not have that piece of paper yet.

There was a total of three person interviewing me. From their choice of words and body language and how my paper was placed, I knew that I've wasted my printer ink and showing them testimonials from names that  they can't appreciate.

Finally, one of them asked, ""I have this ____ product, tell me how would you market it?""

Yo, I have been a freelancer, they have not paid me. So I went on to tell them a legit plan while leaving out the important parts, confidently, since I know my own creation well. All three of them were intrigued to the point that you can almost see the stars in their eyes.

""We will get in touch with you."" That was the last I ever heard from them. Before leaving, I took away the last few pages of my resume out of their copies, I don't like to have my mentors names to be in a pile. It's, to me, a sign of disrespect. My works can be in there, but never my mentors.

I think they invested quite a bit into this strategy thus the representative was quite furious over the phone. 

I'm not sure about how you interviewers will think of me (I don't care for your opinions if you're like the company in the story), but hey, is your recruitment drive just a channel for FREE IDEA GENERATION?

If you want something, you pay for it.

For students or future jobseekers, please, I IMPLORE y'all to be smart about it. I have known of IT companies holding recruitment drives and let the candidates solve their current issue and ultimately, hired no one.

Don't put yourself on the losing end.

266,"Hi all, so with all the hype regarding the recent saga surrounding the issue of misconduct, I've decided to jump onto the bandwagon and just share my two cents worth on this issue.

First, it's reading week with finals just round the corner. So, guys, please be the good university students you're supposed to be (or at least everyone else thinks so) and start studying your entire semester's worth of course materials within these last few days. You don't want to find yourself in the position where you are sitting in the exam hall, staring at the question paper and feeling the sudden, irrepressible urge to peep at those around you (especially at those that may catch your eyes). You are liable for your own actions as adults.

Second, if/when caught, as (hopefully) mature adults, please accept the punishment meted out with dignity. Please don't start putting the blame onto the deanery or any other bodies that is/are responsible for investigating the event and meting out the appropriate punishments. While some may argue that the punishments are inadequate, there are those who would think otherwise. Honestly, it is just impossible to please everyone.

Third, please stop victim- and/or perp-shaming, saying that it's his/her fault that made you wanna peep or that they are trying to gain fame through shame. With all due respect, you could have avoided this if you had just done what you're supposed to do - be a good university student. 

So yeah, with that, I wish you all the best in the upcoming finals.

Cheers.

- No, in fact, he encourages me to date other men, especially men my age. Exclusivity is not a term between us. However, I have never being in a proper BGR, my experiences has always been with SDs and lovers. Should I have a BF, I would want to be faithful to him. 
- Arrangements either goes by monthly allowances or Pay Per Meet. Personally, I only accept monthly payments. He provides for my living expenses and tuition fees. Though I have a proper part time job drawing $1k monthly while studying, it's insufficient. 
- Not always. I know a particular dude who was once a high end male escort and had women taking care, grooming him to be a successful (wealthy) individual.

I just want people to respect the police/legal system and not take matters into their own hands.

If u think there's a problem with the system, challenge with the system in the right way without harming others. 

Yes, she-who-will-not-be-named was traumatized by he-who-will-not-be-named. But that doesn't justify her destroying his life. When did we forget the saying, ""An eye for an eye make the whole world blind.""? How we are treat others is a reflection of ourself, how other people treat us should not affect that. 

To all those who accept her actions and told me to consider if she was my mother or girlfriend or sister or daughter. The answer I give u is the same I will not condone her actions of revealing the perpetrator and dealing her own form of punishment in the form of doxxing even if it's my relative or close friend who is the victim.

To those saying this is victim blaming, this is not victim blaming. Victim blaming is this: ""She should not have bathe in Hall, she is just asking for it, I mean it's well known that there are peeping Toms in NUS Halls."" 

How about you guys consider if he was your father or son or brother or boyfriend. Yes I will hate, despise him for his actions but I will be happy for him that he got lucky, that the system let him off easy, gave him a second chance.

276,"Good evening to all. I'm the OP for #61516. 

For the past few days I had read through the various replies towards my post about BTech and I'm heartened to receive mostly positive reactions. But I believe there are a few points raised by various comments I should address.

But before I begin, please, please, type ""btech"" into the search bar and look at the all past post about btech. You would understand that there are students out there who do feel inferior, when compared to a BEng student. There are students who are lost, wondering whether to take up BTech. Remember that my post wasn't explicitly meant to glorify BTech. My post was to give an insight from an employer's POV and to motivate, albeit with a little bit of comparison between BTech and BEng. Because as I've mentioned, that post was triggered over a conversation that I overheard.

Some of you take it to challenge my POV and I welcome that. I have over 17 years of experience since I graduated from BEng and my POV is going to be a very direct one, from an ex-employee into an employer's POV.

Employers do not care how much hard work you put into to land yourself into NUS/NTU/govt universities.
Employers do not care how much you suffered while you are in school. Employers do not care how stress you were when you are taking 5 modules along with CCAs.
Employers do not care about the personal history and emotional baggage of all prospective interviewees and how they fought for placings.
Employers certainly do not care about your jealousy towards a particular individual who f*cked around during his younger days and managed to secure himself in BTech while you slog your life away in BEng, with a 5.0 GPA.

Remember, every hiring manager (probably) was an undergraduate once. We know the hardship. You are NOT special. We do not know you. You do not deserve our emotional attention on why you are more worthy just because you think you worked very hard for it.

Lets be practical. My company is like a bleeding wound. I need someone who can stop the bleed. Your hard work securing that 5.0 GPA and your water canoe (sorry for using you an example) CCA isn't going to help me with that.

Every year I have hundreds of students who apply for jobs. All highlighting about their GPAs and their merit achievements. Fair enough, that is all they have to showcase about themselves. Having those positive points in your resume only tells me 2 things. You are able to multi-task between school and other activities, and you did your homework before taking your exam.

When I hire an undergraduate, I expect them to think like an undergraduate. When I hire a graduate, I expect them to think like a graduate. When I hire a diploma graduate, I expect them to think like a diploma graduate. That is, you know your stuffs. Besides your theoretical knowledge on the subject, you have nothing to bring to the table to scale my company's business higher. With that piece of paper, you enter the workforce as a blank piece of paper and you go around demanding high pay while having sub-par knowledge and/or experience. Employers do not appreciate that. We need talents. We have budget. Sense of self-entitlement no? Elitist thinking that you are better just because you're from BEng?

Getting a degree is like a rite of passage for most of us. But it is a very carefully considered decision for full time working adults. Especially for long haul courses like BTech, where I'm aware that class sizes shrinks up to 50% to 60% from first year towards the last.

I do not doubt the quality that BEng offers. I certainly agree that BTech's curriculum stringency is watered down. To say that BTech students in general only want to pass is true as well. Which was precisely why I said the truth lies in the students themselves.

You can offer an incredibly quality content rich course like BEng. When you have students who graduated with flying colours, yet unable to perform their task as expected, it's a fail. You can offer a watered down BTech course. When you have student's who's goal is to pass and forget, is also a fail.

Like what one of our fellow OP said,

- Part time BTech is easier to pass but harder to maintain
- Full time BEng is harder to pass but has higher quality learning
- Both produces graduates of the same calibre, mostly overconfident but cmi


They're equally true. Whether they can bring the required knowledge and skills to the table, it's entirely up to them. To outright say that BEng is more superior than BTech is misleading. Likewise to say that BTech is inferior compared to BEng. 

At the end of the day, whoever can contribute most to the company, is favored most. (Copy, Paste)Employers looks for more than paper qualifications. The character, knowledge and skills that a BTech student presents, is worth more than a fresh graduate's first class hons. 5 years down the road, whoever can offer more of their skills and knowledge, whoever can display more achievements, goes to better places, be it a BEng or a BTech.


And for god's sake, can you students please stop with all these sexual dramas in school. Is that why my applicants mostly fail because they're more concern about having sex than actually studying. It is even more happening than K dramas.

Peace.

Hi OP, like you, I have also dealt with local grads, either through interview or interacting with some at work. While I agree that balancing a full time job and studying part time is akin to the stress of taking 5 modules per semester while balancing CCA's, it certainly does not justify the lower standards of BTech.

And yes, I was from BTech.

If you actually try to take a look at some of the midterm and exam papers, you would find that the standards of the questions were largely watered down. If you were to compare BEng and BTech papers, the difficulty standards are very very different. There is also the learning standards whereby for BTech, the profs are usually more lenient, in the sense that you can see students presenting horrible slides full of words and off the main topic, submitting horrible reports (copy paste from Wikipedia with no citation without removing the inline citations), even answering 1 out of 4 questions in the final exam and yet they can still score a C. Frankly even I would admit that this is unfair to full time students.

That being said, I have met fresh NUS NTU grads that cannot tell me what Central Limit Theorem is nor can they illustrate volume vs linear expansion. I have also seen employees from BTech that submitted technical report that aside from them adding colorful fonts, it can be jolly well written by a technician.

tldr: 
- Part time BTech is easier to pass but harder to maintain
- Full time BEng is harder to pass but has higher quality learning
- Both produces graduates of the same calibre, mostly overconfident but cmi

It’s tiring I know but it’s worth it, being in control of the pace and intensity. Not to mention, I’m sure your bf would appreciate the view ;)

Rmb went out b4 with this super out-of-my-league girl for a meal, then I payed first because I walked to the door first. She offered to PayLah me back, but that time my account got frozen because of some small useless stuffs, so I told her I would text her when I got the thing sorted out.
But KNS ended up the account got fixed after CNY, so all the debts all erased mah! Then ofc I can't ask her for the money because (i) like it's so cheap of me to chase back 1 small meal (it wasn't anything fantastic) and (ii) the CNY mark passed to the debt is erased then if the debt is still valid then is like I sabo'ed her into bad luck right? 
So actually it's just a small meal so I can't really be bothered, but then I'm scared I offended her because like those very strong independent girl refuse to let guys pay for them right? And I understand la it's not like I'm her bf or anything so no good reason for me to chia her also...
So my conscience is clean cuz I didn't pay to ""preserve my fragile manhood"" or ""preserve the patriarchy"" or whatever lame shit, but I do feel like it was just a stupid story so quite funny share wif u all lor...

People from his time probably can't even comprehend the stuff we know and see today. We had photographed something that would take lifetimes to reach even if we travel at the speed of light. We had sent probes into the outer edges of our solar system. Manned exploration of nearby celestial bodies are happening in less than a decade from now. There's so much mystery in the cosmos that we as a human species had only unravel the tip of the iceberg.

I think the right thing to do is to place my hand faced up beside hers and she'd flip the coins into my palm. However, my brain kinda farted and I used my hand to directly grab them from her palm. Even worse, somehow my hand-eye coordination went haywire too and I extended way too far, almost to her wrist. And I kinda just slid my hand all the way from her wrist to her fingers to grab the coins. Understandably, she gave me the weirdest stare :| and then it hit me, ""that was absolutely creepy and she probably thinks I'm some sexual predator trying to flirt her"". OMG.

Even though at times I would prefer some personal space when I am feeling down, she will constantly stay by my side. This meant so much to me as I could always turn to someone, hug her and lie on her shoulders any time I wanted to. After a few weeks into our relationship, I asked her if she wanted to do it. She asked me if I was fine with it even if she was already banged by many other people in the past. Honestly, I was quite shocked by her reply because I did not expect her to be this type of person. However, I know that I still love her a lot because after thinking about it a while, I actually didn't mind the fact that she was banged by other people before. Our relationship got better and better each time I banged her. However, after two years, I felt that the relationship needed to come to an end as I will hardly see her due to school.

304,"Personally though I occasionally respectfully disagree with some of the things Prof Ben says (sometimes some things do come off as a bit elitist imho), I appreciate his honesty when grades are important, and goes on to say what are the specific grades he looks at from a hiring standpoint. It's quite direct but as the Chinese saying goes 良药苦口 (good medicine tastes bitter), he shares meaningful action steps on what you need to focus on (which in another sense, hints at what you should ditch or prioritise less to get the role you want, e.g. non-career specific CCAs and leadership experiences are not very important), sometimes it's hard to swallow but the advice is there take it or leave it. There are many other professors and academic staff who tend to say grades are unimportant and say just being in nus makes us exceptional, which in my view is just the kind of the thing that lulls some of us into a false sense of security and to lower our expectations of grades (especially when we're naive y1s). Would profs have gotten to their positions without having stellar uni grades or successful careers? Chances are likely not (correct me if I'm wrong). Grades are not the end-all, but they're a prerequisite for many things. Frankly, this just seems to be a way to console the 70% of students who don't get an A or A- for that mod when they fall on lower end of the bell curve. In fact, that illusion holds us back in moving away from a grades-obsessed society, because you cannot fix the problem if you're not even willing to acknowledge it. I think it's quite funny how he tries to organise the matchmaking events and etc when he sees a problem, some may say that's kaypoh but his willingness to act unconventionally to solve a problem (even if it may make him look strange or silly to others) impresses me and is definitely something I can get behind.

I cannot really help you with that, I would recommend to feedback to the bus operators to ask them to request making more handlebars to help provide more support. 

I do believe that it is a matter of the suspension, as well as how your drivers drive, along with the winding terrain you have around, which results in you rolling about. Just look up the underneath of the bus. They're supported by balloons or something, when cars are typically supported by springs.


Though, I'd say this: your handlebars are made of this:

OD 32 x 1.6 mm SS Tubes (looks and sounds like SS 304), with a centreline radius of around R = 127mm.

The process is draw-bending for the one at the front, and roll-bending for the ones you hold onto in the middle of the bus. 

You can sort of tell from measuring them. A quick google search, a vernier caliper and a few more tools could get that for you.

Now, if anyone wants to effect a change, you have the information. I believe my peers are more than ready to do a relatively profitable ( around a few hundred bucks?) mini project on this, while I work on my FYP...

318,"Hi there, hope you are doing alright, especially since the midterms are coming to the end. If you are feeling joyful, great! But if you are not, because of whatever is happening in your life, I need to let you know something.

That its okay.

It's okay to feel lost, it's okay to feel alone, it's okay to feel hurt, troubled, sad and stressed. We all know that feeling, that feeling we get when we see others having great fun on instagram while ours seem to be more lonely. That feeling when we grind hard but still don't get the grade we want. That feeling when we practice long hours and we are still put on the reserve team. That feeling seeing couples in public while we remain alone.

And I understand. It's frustrating you see, we all don't know where life is taking us, where we are heading to or what is going to happen next. We all want to be loved, to be cared for and to be proud of ourselves. At the end of the day, we all want to be proud of the life that we have lived.

Sometimes it's hard. It's really hard to find that meaning, the one that keeps you going everyday. To others we may seem strong, cheerful and happy. But deep down, we may be more brittle than we think.

I hope you are someone who is truly strong, and leading the life you want to live. If you are, great! Help someone who is struggling and lost. But if you aren't, I hope you realize this:

It's not easy being you.

You never chose to be born, you never told god you wanted to come to this world and live. For all we could know, you could have been born a prawn, swimming freely in the ocean. Yet, you are here, as a human being. You could have given up, you could have thrown in the towel a long time ago. But you didn't.

So the fact that you are still here, living, breathing and surviving. Take pride in that. You were thrown in this world and you hustled through and you know what? I'm proud of you. I'm proud that you chose to live, and not die. That alone, is an achievement.

Take pride in yourself, because it takes great courage to be you. It takes great courage to wake up in the morning, and be you. It takes great courage to experience those feelings of sadness and pain. It don't matter what you look like, or where you came from. If you don't like something in your life, change it, work hard for it, but if it doesn't work out, don't hate yourself for it.

In the end, everything will be okay. So if it's not okay, it's not the end. Hang in there, and don't give up. I don't believe you were created by chance. You were created because you were born to do great things. Your existence here, changes things. It changes the course of this world. You may not have realized it, but someone's life on this planet has changed because of you.

So go out there, and never stop being you, chasing that dream. Your dreams are suppose to live with you, and walk with you, but never to die with you. Don't take them to the grave with you.

Be loving and be caring. Don't judge another man, because everyone has a story. Villains are created, not born. If you are at the top, help someone else up. See someone in trouble? Help them. Take pride in being human and helping another, for the meaning of life is a life of meaning.

So hang in there, and sacrifice who you are today, for who you will become. You and I both know you can do this. You and I both know you want this, and you will do it, no matter the odds. If you are in pain and suffering, good. Because behind all that, is the person you want to be.
