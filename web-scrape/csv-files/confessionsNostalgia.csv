0,"It has been 2 years since we broke up and for the past 2 years i have tried to forget about it and moved on with my life. I got myself busy with work and seeked self-improvement. For some time, I didn't had any issues and able to commit myself into work and focus on life goals.

But for the past few days, all of the sudden I had flashbacks of the time when we were together and I can't seem to focus with my daily tasks and spent time thinking about it ..

How can I overcome this?

1,"To be honest, it feels like I have come so far till the point now in NUS. Meaning I just feel like I am not as ""pure"" as before, and I have the tendency of wanting people to change perceptions of me.

Just a background of myself. I used to study overseas during my nursery and kindergarten, where English was not my first language. Only since primary school, I have always been studying in Singapore. As I was mostly home during those periods where my parents were working day in day out, I had never really socialise with other children. I did not even know how to communicate with them and not even knowing how to make friends. 

This got worse in primary school where i suffered bullying for about 3 years, where i had the naive thinking that if I was nice to anybody regardless bullies or not, they will appreciate me one day. But no, this never happened and school had been hell for me. They even criticised my looks and me being ""weird"". My mum found out one day that i was bullied and told me to be harsh if need be. I totally changed my attitude towards people, changed my looks by dressing more appropriately and etc and even focusing on building close connections. Of course in between I had experienced some ups and downs during my connection with people, such as betrayals and even those with toxic mentality. 

Thus I feel like I have changed in terms of how i interact with people. This is good for me personally as I have more people to communicate with and etc. But what I have noticed is, based on my past experience of making such connections, I just cannot help but have the tendency to always change myself(such as looks, personality and etc) as compared to how people usually view me. For example my secondary school friend had the thinking initially that I was always very quiet, not dressing up. But now in the same uni, she saw me and commented that I look and act totally different of how she viewed me initially. Even towards the bullies in the past, I kept making sure I look better and do much better than them even though i tried my best not to bother about them. However after meeting them, I then focus on how to make myself even better than before and change their perceptions for the better. In short, I seem to bother more about people's opinions and impressions of me, when I am trying my best to love myself by just being myself. Instead it feels quite pressurising at times having these tendencies. Sighs...

Today, i saw her again in another lecture sitting with some other girls and sat right behind her. This time, i decided to talk to her after lecture. However, right after lecture, i saw her going off with another guy and my heart broke.

3,"Its been 12 years since we first met. The first time I saw you, I froze for a few seconds just thinking of what an angel you were and how happy I would to just be your friend. You were absolutely perfect and honestly, out of my league. 

As months past, we got closer and began hanging out on our own. Somehow you started coming to my house and spending time with me despite your ridiculously tight schedule. I thought you were just fooling around and so I didn't put my all into it. I was always half hearted for I feared of getting myself burnt infront of a ""too good to be true"" perfect mate. 

I guess you grew tired of waiting and hinting, that over the years we each met our current partners. I told you I missed you then but I guess it was too late. It's been 4/3 years since each of us got married respectively but not a single day has passed for me without thinking of you. 

I love my current partner and am responsible for our marriage and will not do anything to jeopardize it, but my heart still yearns for you every day, every minute, uncontrollably. I hope you have found your 100% happiness with your partner and will never look back.

4,"It’s 2020 and I cannot hold it anymore. This has been bothering me since last semester. I played a nasty and despicable trick in order to get into the dean list. I feel like confessing here because the guilt is eating me alive every night. I can’t believe I did THAT to bring down my cohort peers. Please do not judge me; I’m really here to share my stories. So where should I begin? 

Last semester, I had four finals. I remember I studied till very late and I snack a lot. Like literally a lot. I swear I ate a house full of chips, cookies and some sugary candies. I was so hungry while studying in UTown. I stay in a hall by the way. So what happened was that I had a bad stomachache. I couldn’t unload my faeces naturally. It feels like entering the JB custom - always jammed. The night before my first paper, I did not shit. I hold my shit throughout the examination as I was so stressed and worried for my paper. I silently farted and I think it affected the people around me so badly that they were complaining to the invigilators. I even saw the guy beside me almost vomited by giving an awful expression. It hurts me so bad that my farts are making people around me uncomfortable. I tried my best to hold them but I couldn’t. I kept letting waves of smelly farts during the whole duration of the examination. As a result, some of the people around me did not complete their paper and submitted half-answered paper. I glanced and I saw. I was so remorseful about this. I observed the same trend for the other three papers. I told my best friend after this. She told me it was not my intention and I shouldn’t feel bad about it. As a shy girl always, I don’t know what to do. 

Although my stomach is feeling way better now after the exams, I’m fearful that the same shit will happen again in this new coming semester. I’ve two finals this time round though.

5,"I’m best friends with this guy - we meet so regularly and text so much and I love it. I love him. In a platonic way. Recently we had this idea of making a bucket list sort of thing together. Things to do in 2020. And it was all going well until we actually made a physical list (on WhatsApp). And he created it with the title Dates ....... I have no idea how to feel. I mean I want to ask him why he labelled it as dates but I also don’t want to make it awkward for nothing. Is it a big deal? can the word date be platonic? Am I overthinking this? I don’t want to lead him on but I also don’t wanna be extra when maybe he’s just calling it dates for the heck of it. Please help. Sounds like a small issue but I don’t know whether it’s normal so it’s making me freak a little. Thanks x

6,"Ang moh student here. I want to share a little story... I went to FairPrice today to buy some groceries as the trip has been long overdue. The store appeared to be very busy, as it was after work hours for most people. Once I was done shopping, I got to the tills and jumped between several tills to try and beat the crowds. At the last till I waited, it seemed to take forever, so I became a bit inpatient and at the same time annoyed, that it was taking such a long time. I honestly couldn’t understand why it was taking so long when the other queues appeared to be moving faster. As I got closer to the till, I saw an auntie behind that was scanning the products and bagging them for the customer in front.  She appeared to be older than 60 years old and although it seemed like she was doing everything very slowly, I could tell that she was trying to rush and do it as fast as she could. I instantly felt extremely bad for getting a bit annoyed and wondering why the check-out couldn’t be faster. After  having a good look at her, I looked around and realised that most of the staff members appear to be elders but that doesn’t stop them from doing a fantastic job. My heart clenched at the realisation that people of this age have to still continue working. It made me really, really upset, but at the same time angry, as I see posts on here about people asking whether they should give some money to their parents. 

My mum also works at an unqualified job and this really hit close to home, as I could picture her in this situation since she is alone and has no savings. The point I’m making: please take care of your parents and for god’s sake, give these people a well deserved break by providing a state pension like any western country. If this country has the money to pay every boy to go to the army for a year and a half, why doesn’t it have money to provide state pension?

She couldn't buy it for me because she rather spend the money on more useful stuff. I didn't get much toys when I was young either. I played with books that my Sister read. I only got two toys when I was young. A toy car and a mini cashier. I still had it till today. My army mates asked me about the stories of those Disney cartoons. I couldn't answer because my Mum didn't subscribe to any disney channels as I was not well to do. So I watch Channel 8 dramas and that was my childhood. They said I got no childhood, laughed at me for not knowing what they were talking about. I have childhood. My childhood was so much better than you. My dad brought my to fishing. My mum brought me for window shopping. My sister going on a breakfast with me on a Saturday. I am always rich, because I have my family constantly by my side. I do not need to substitute solitude with cartoons because my family are always there. Dont say I got no childhood. In fact, you are the one without.

9,"Yesterday, I dreamt of a guy that was going out with me. I was really happy, really really happy. But I woke up. I realised it was all a dream. I sat on my bed, looking back at how far I've come.

In primary school, people called me all sorts of names e.g. ahgua, guniang, sissy etc just because of my more feminine moves. I brushed all of that off because I know all their opinions were not important as I am who I am. 

As I start to mature, I started to realise I am interested in both male and female. Whenever I am walking on the streets, I would be checking people from both genders out. I would be stealing a glance at them and thinking how good would it be if I could also get a partner just like them, be in love etc. 

As I grow up in a conservative family, I am unable to voice out or to vent my frustrations at people, not even my friends. I have never told anyone about my sexual preferences. Even I, as the owner of this body, denied the fact that I am actually a bisexual. I cheated myself into believing that I am straight, and this constant suppression of desires had myself depressed and really introverted during my teenage years. However, deep down I know I am actually a bisexual. I would then cry myself into sleep, wondering why am I different from what the society perceived a male should like.  

As I enter poly, I met more people. I see people from all walks of life, be it straight, bisexual, homosexual etc. And I remember it was one fine day, on my way to school, a thought came across my mind. If I intend to keep my sexual preference as a secret forever, and if I continue to deny the fact that I am a bisexual, isn't it very pathetic as you don't even recognise and acknowledge yourself for who you really are? Because if you don't even accept for who you are, how are you expecting other people to accept who you are too should you tell them about your sexual preferences in the future? From then on, I start to accept myself for who I am and I am happier and contented with life since.

Although I still don't have a partner as of now to adore me, at least I appreciate who I am, and I love myself more as compared to the past. 

I just wanted to share my story. I hope to let everyone knows that there is this group of people in LGBT society who are still suffering internally. Not because of how you think of them, but how they think of themselves. Just because society sets the standards and all of us believes in it, this group of people just follow blindly and thought the standards was ""right"", thinking that the outliers (like them) were ""wrong"". Truth is, society isn't always right. Only if we could all think deeper, be a little compassionate and stand from a different viewpoint. Maybe, just maybe, the world would be a nicer place.

12,"As I was on my way home today, I was suddenly reminded of a failed relationship that happened years ago. 

I was young at 18 and I met him. We were so attracted to each other almost instantly. MSN was a thing that time, and we could chat for hours literally every single day. He asked me to be his girlfriend on Christmas Day and I said yes. This was despite knowing that he will be leaving the country in a year; he will be moving overseas and I am most definitely not. There were ups and downs throughout the relationship; it was not a healthy one. We were too young to know how to handle conflicts, and too immature to understand commitment. Among the things we talked about, we said that we would marry each other. At that time, it felt like he was ‘the one’, and he felt the same way too. Time wasn’t the kindest, we grew apart along with the physical distance. In the second year of the LDR, he told me one night that he was falling for someone else.. As immature as I was, I screamed. I was livid. I was heartbroken. Nothing could be done to rewind that moment, or mend that was already broken. I did all that stupid things: hung up on him then tried calling back, only to have my calls rejected; spammed him with lots of messages and received no replies; go from “f u” to a miserable apology... He blocked me eventually and through those days of silence, it was a chance to thoroughly examine myself. I learnt that there is no right or wrong in a breakup; relationship is a dance which takes two to tango. Anyone has the right to leave. He gave me a closure eventually, which I’m grateful for. He returned, we talked, and parted ways “officially”. As I re-look at an old diary, I’m surprised that today is exactly the 6th year since we parted. Perhaps this explains that weird feeling that I get today. 

To the brokenhearted, the rebuilding phase may be long and trying. It took me a full year before I was actually happy again. Do what you need to do, and I hope that you will find the way and the will to move onwards. Happy holidays.

13,"It's 2 a.m. and I can't fall asleep. It's been around 3 months since we stopped talking. Everyday I ask myself why things had to turn out this way, and what could I have done differently. But there's no redo.

It pains me even today because even today, against the advices of my close friends I'm still holding on to the memories and feelings. I'm choosing to hold them tight and alive even today because I just know that if I were to stop doing so, then none those moments that were shared, feelings that still burns would mean anything.

The past is not some worthless thing that is supposed to be trashed. It is a part of me. It is a part of our history. I'm somehow supposed to move on, that we're all suppose to move on when something didn't go right. Yet, precisely because time is a commodity, that every single moment in our life is so precious and worth preserving. And everyone that walked into our lives matter, especially, especially those that made your heart flutter because they are the ones that made you feel most alive.

Struggling a little more everyday.

I was two-timed by an ex with cancer after I accompanied her through the treatment stage. 
Years later, I bore her outstanding study loan cos I was her guarantor.
After paying that loan off, I was chased by the same bank for her credit card bills she forged my signature to be her supp card owner for and supp card owners are liable for the amounts the main card holder owe.
As unwilling as I was, I just went took responsibility for what came.
Recently, I was hospitalised for an heart attack and am awaiting my bypass surgery with a 3% risk of death. 
I share these not for sympathy. Life isn’t about comparing whose life is shittier. I am just sharing that my life isn’t a bed of roses. I am not necessarily living a better life than you but I will be fine. 

I have always received messages from many whose lives aren’t beds of roses all along. There are many who shared that they can get more for their family with their limited Budget. It may sound unexpected but I have always read how some who are bedridden look at our posts to get connected to the world out there. Especially after I shared my condition, many silent friends got in touch with me to share their own experiences. Some have lost their loved ones. Some are suffering from some physical or mental conditions. 

Everyone has their own stories to live. Every story is unique. Many times, we are given challenges we need to face because those are tests to prepare us for greater things. Again, I am living my life story too. I totally understand how life gets shitty at times, how dark the outlook can be, how we don’t see light at the end of the tunnel at times.

This is written to every single friend who feels life hasn’t been the best to them. Hey, fight on. You are never alone. Someone in Singapore is fighting all his shitty situations too. Life is unfair in the fairest way. Your story will be a good one ultimately.

Let’s enjoy our lives together.

I, for one, am a Singaporean living in France. Few weekends back I finally had a legitimate chicken rice together with some Singaporean friends at the onset of winter, in a Parisian bistro.

The chicken was originated in France. Had to follow French AOC rules. Didn't bother asking, was written in the menu.

I think the chicken rice cost 11 euros. I forgot, the price was written, in a font size that is smaller than where the chicken was originated.

To me, the enjoyment of finally having a home-cooked food was immense, and the company of similar-minded Singaporeans far away from home - I could only say I am grateful.

18,"There are many people talking about how they don't have close friends in life, about how hard it is to make friends in uni. Many people have said that it is part of adult life that friends come and go and they just have to get used to it. I disagree. 

My grandmother passed away recently, and at her wake many of her friends whom she knew for decades came forward and shared how they were thankful for all that my grandmother did for them. They recounted how she went to care for them after they had surgery, how she said encouraging words to them at their lowest point when people were criticising them, and how much they would miss the joy she brought to others. My grandmother is my role model in what it means to love my friends. 

So when a friend in school told me she changed friends whenever she entered a new phase of life because it's part of ""adulting"", I was alarmed, because I feel that is degrading the precious value of friendship. Nowadays a girl and a guy can meet in uni and then when one of them confesses after less than a month the other says, ""Sigh, you mean alot to me, and I really wanted to keep this friendship."" In my mind I'm thinking, what friendship? They barely know each other...? 

Friendship goes beyond companionship, it is a tried and tested bond that stands the tests of time and circumstance. I myself am lucky to have close friends that I have known for over 10 years. I know they will be in my life for a long time because my friendship with them is not seasonal. Sometimes I really hate my friends for the things they do or the hurt they cause me. But I realised that friendship works like this: I like my friends for some of their characteristics, but I love them despite some of their characteristics. They are in my life because both sides invest in the friendship, and continuously care, love and forgive. 

So to all those out there who feel empty because they don't have a friend that stays, don't let others tell you that it's reality. To experience friendship that lasts a lifetime is possible and beautiful. Keep trying because from my grandmother's life I know it is possible :)

Slowly and steadily, people starts to move on, and gradually stops talking to you. When you are still friends with the clique, you are always the only one asking them out, or they would just casually say we should have an outing, but it always didn't happen. 

You didn't know what happened, and after 1 year, seeing everyone else having fun with their friends, you find yourself having no friends at all, and being all alone. From what used to be people celebrating your birthday, to a point in time where no one wishes you anymore. 

From being with a group of friends with joy, to seeing them enjoying themselves without you. You realised you are a toxic friend, and slowly things have turned out this way, yet you are unsure of what to do. You search online, only to see pages of information, saying to avoid toxic people, but no information of helping a toxic person to change themselves for the better.

Thus I would like to have some opinions, how can I change myself for the better, so that I would not be a toxic person anymore, and be able to make friends with people again, and falling in love with someone?

I'm not sure if you know this, but as profound of a thinker as he was, Socrates was a little obscene with his language. I'm guiding my finger over each page, waiting for God to catatonically stop it over a particular phrase that I should be paying attention to. My finger grazes back and forth through a certain page like I'm reading braille when a passage jumps out at me.

But I still love you, and you still love me. It hurts me to see that you've given up when I'm still fighting. But then again, I'm happy when you're happy. And I can understand why it might be easier for you to give up. It pains me to know that i can't be the person to comfort you whenever you feel down. It hurts me to know that we can't ever share the happiest experiences together again.

I cry whenever I see our photos together, when you and me were laughing and smiling. Why does life have to be so hard on interfaith/racial relationships when it comes to family? The depression just stacks on.

I can't find it in myself to give up on you. I don't know how to give up on you. I know you're still undecided on whether or not we could get back together as a couple because we still love each other, but you feel it's easier for you to break it off for now.
You cry whenever you see me cry, so I try to hide the sadness.

Still trying to find a way to get past this pain

34,"Hi everyone, not a confession, but I just wanted to lighten up the posts on this page, so here's Part 1 in a series of posts to guide you guys through exam period.
(Yes, this is a fictional story)


#1:
Today my first class is at Science. I like it when my classes are at Science. It has the nicest study areas, good food, but best of all is the walk from the MRT to FoS. There's something about this stroll that helps me gather my thoughts before my lessons.

As a Freshman who doesn't stay on campus, my days are mostly travelling to school, and going home. Sometimes if I'm lucky, I'll have a few friends to travel the journey home with. As I walk pass the NUH sign, I notice a group of Med students who don the NUS logo on their attire. The group consists of 1 boy and 2 girls, and they're laughing over something that I can't make out. Seeing them so cheerful and at ease around friends gives me a slight tinge of regret for not staying in a hall or RC, and now I have no one to spend my days with. The only thing giving me the strength to go to school each day is in the hopes that today I'll meet someone to share my moments with. Someone who can take me out of this constant drag each day and make my school days filled with joy and anticipation.

""Oof!"" Lost in my daze, I bumped right into a girl, causing her to drop her notes she was carrying.

""So sorry,"" I quickly helped her to pick up some of the stuff on the floor. As I passed the stack of notes back to her, I realised some of the notes were for GER.

""You taking GER too?""

""Yeah, the exam's this week huh."" Her voice was soft and gentle. As I looked into her eyes, my heart gave a quick leap. I don't have high standards, but gosh she sure was pretty. I tried not to stare at the way her brown hair fell just at her shoulders, highlighting her collarbones which were just visible over the black ""NUS"" shirt that she was wearing.

""Uh.. yeah, here's your stuff."" I quickly looked away and smiled, hopefully not creeping her out.

""Thanks so much!"" She walked off before I could think of anything else.

I tried not to look too affected as I continued walking to class.

Hope that this was a good read! Do let me know in the comments if you want to see a Part 2, or more of these type of work. I hope that I can bring a refreshing tone to this page.

36,"Since young, I have always been socially-deemed as unattractive. People always bullied me because I was damn ugly and fat. Also, my love life was literally non-existent, all the girls that I liked never liked me back. Mind you, I was really trying my hardest to get a gf, but to no avail. Due to my image, I had zero self-esteem. I was very depressed and sad most of the time, and I just felt very empty and I just wanted to feel something. 

After army, I got into NUS Biz. I didn't get the chance to apply for FOPs so I had little to no friends in school. I tried signing up for Aphrodite lately but after getting both matches, they immediately ghosted me after seeing my profile picture, why do people always judge me by my looks first...

Last year, however, I met the girl of my dreams. I went for NUS Bizad Charity Run 2019 alone last year. I wanted to motivate myself to be healthier and also hope the I could meet some new people. During the run, I accidentally tripped and fell at the basketball court area. Even though it wasn't that serious, I was pretty shagged out from the run and laid there for a while. Suddenly, this really chio girl who was in the middle of running stopped and approached me, asking if I was okay. I was super shocked because I never thought someone like her would approach me.

She helped me up and kept asking if I was ok. I told her I was fine and that I could continue running and wanted to finish it. She then offered to run the rest of the route together and wahhh I was literally damn happy but tried to look calm. She was wearing a pair of light pink Nike shoes with the blue shirt. And not to be creepy or anything, but she smelt really good too. She was chatty and bubbly throughout the run, and we talked about life in NUS. She was also from Biz. Sadly, the run ended and she really made 5 km seem like 1 km. Even though we talked for a bit, my dumbass couldn't bring myself to ask for her name, and she didn't ask me for mine either. I have never been able to get her out of my head ever since, I really wish I can see her again. 

 I hope that I will be able to find her through NUSWhispers and that she will be reading this. To that girl: I really hope that that you have signed up again for the upcoming BCR 2020. If you haven't I hope you will do it in hopes of being able to run together again. I will definitely be on the lookout for those light pink nike shoes at the starting line at 5pm outside MRB :')

41,"Dear NUS students,

I am so happy that I discovered this NUSWhispers Facebook page. During my times at NUS 7 years ago, the page was called “NUS Confessions” (I remember that when it was created, it caused some controversy in conservative and prudish Singapore), and I was curious why the page had become inactive. I am glad to see that the NUS Confessions page has continued by becoming NUSWhispers.

I was an exchange student from Europe (I don’t want to give too many details about my country, as some people might recognise me) at NUS during the 2012/2013 academic year, and reading through the confessions makes me so nostalgic about my year abroad there. I wanted to share with you that this year has been unforgettable for me, probably the best in my life so far. I met some people who became my best friends, and met my first love there. Although we are not together anymore (thank you long distance relationship), we are still close friends and I still cherish today the memories of our times together.

I visited Singapore recently for the first time since I left in 2013, and it was such a pleasure for me to go back to the places where I had so many good memories : I saw that U-Town is now fully completed (and what an amazing place it is for students !). I also went back to the Foodclique food court at U-Town, where I had an Indian meal, which was my favourite. 

This meal was like a Proust Madeleine for me ; so many more forgotten memories came back to my mind as I closed my eyes and ate the fluffy and crispy roti prata and tasted the spices and textures of the briyani rice and flavourful curry and vegetables. Later on, I went back to the U-Town swimming pool (my old NUS card still worked, I didn’t expect that !), and watched with delight the sun set over the graduate residence towers and people chilling and playing together on the U-Town green, reminiscing myself with nostalgia that I was one of these people I was watching 7 years ago. I also took advantage of my stay in Singapore to walk and explore the hidden gems of the city.

Singapore truly feels like a second home to me, and it will forever be associated with the great memories of my youth years. I just wanted to share these memories with you via this post, and tell you that your country will always have a special place in my heart.

Sending you lots of love,

42,"Reading post #71864 made me feel very guilty, so here is a confession.

When I was 18 years old, I was horny (like many other teenagers) yet forced to stay at home to study for Alevels, so I started flirting with my domestic helper. Since her English was not very good, I was able to convince her to have unprotected sex. I was also able to convince her that letting me ejaculate inside her would be easier than having to wash the bedsheets all over again. Yes, I know I was wrong. I was a very selfish person back then. 

Eventually, her contract ended and she returned to her home country. Some time later, my family received a phone call from her saying that she was pregnant with my child. Imagine if you were a parent and a maid accused your son of fathering her child. Would you believe her? Of course not! I poisoned the well still further by making up false stories about her stealing money from my wallet etc.  Before long, my family was convinced that she had integrity issues. My family ignored her calls. Eventually, my father got fed up and scolded her over the phone, accusing her of lying, threatening to call the police and asking her to leave our family alone. The calls stopped after that. I was very happy and boasted about it to my friends and NS buddies. Eventually, everyone got bored with my story and I moved on to other conquests, so I kind of forgot about the entire incident. until recently.

Today, with the benefit of maturity and hindsight, I truly and sincerely regret what I did. As a married man now, I completely understand the difficulties involved in raising a child. I imagine that it is orders of magnitude more difficult to raise a child as a single parent. Originally, I intended to fly over to look at the child and confirm whether he is indeed mine before taking further action. However, on second thoughts, I realized that it dosent matter whose child it is: I had done a grave wrong, so I should make compensation irregardless. In addition to a significant lump sum payment, I intend to also sponsor the child’s accomodation, air fare and tuition fees if the child manages to get a place in NUS in a few year’s time. And I will NOT do any paternity testing.

This post is a reminder to all the other guys on NUSWhispers to do the right thing and treat their women well.

43,"I attended a 'reunion' of sorts with other university course mates a week ago. As it has been a few years since graduation, some of my ex-classmates commented that there was a ""Bullingdon Club""-lite group at university. 

When I researched a bit further, I realise that some of my higher SES friends have heard about it. None of them were invited to the parties though. 

My girlfriend who works in the hospitality sector told me that certain five - star hotel private dining rooms in the Orchard Road area are often booked for such purpose, for people to interact with other fellow mates of similar socioeconomic status. 

Was wondering if anyone else has heard of this dining club and if they still organise such events. As a sociology grad, this is both amusing and relevant in the broader national conversation on class.

44,"Hi Prof Ben,

Could you share some thoughts and advice regarding on the part-time degree BTech(Computing) programme in NUS? 

How is this BTech(Computing) course different from BEng(Computer science) part-time course in NTU? Is the modules/coverage not as indepth as compared to the full-time course in NUS? Is there bell-curve in BTech (if have, it is within part-time students only or the whole sch)? Is the BTech course offer similar modules as the full time programme? Is this fast-paced?

Noticed there isn't any BTech(Computer Science) course, whereas there is BTech(Software Engineering) course. Would like to understand why there isn't any BTech computer science course as there is a full-time programme on this, but instead it has a BTech Software Enginnering course which NUS currently offers Master course on this. What is the difference between CS and SE, and any reason why BTech programme is on SE instead of CS?

Is BTech cert recognized by employers? Is the employment rate high? As given from the name of the cert, it would be easily recognized that it is not a full-time course. Is there any difference on the quality  of the cert between a full time and part time course from NUS? How is NTU BTech degree differs from other computing part time degree from Private uni etc?

Lastly, what would be recommended for working adult to pursue a part time degree - BTech(computing) degree from NUS or BEng(Com science) course from NTU? Given that NTU emphasized that both full-time & part-time BEng cert are the same, hence it would be more recognized (in a way)? 

Greatly appreciate your inputs on this. Thank you very much!

45,"Recently I have been feeling kind of under the weather and unmotivated to keep on studying .

But it is not because I am struggling with my studies. In fact, far from it, I consider myself a ""straight A"" students: my results are exceptionally good (for someone like me); my peers look up to me; my parents are proud of me and I plan to keep on excelling academically as far as I am able to.

However the stress are taking on the toll and what with ever increasing workload causing sleepless nights (even more so when exams is near) have turned  me into a much more irritable person. My gf is quite understanding with my spending more time to studying than with her. However our communication have also been windling down a bit.

Penning all this down at 2 AM in the morning makes me feel depressed and question myself that actually what I am actually studying for.  Perhaps my being an academically strong student not because of any real purpose or objective, but I just find it a practical thing to follow since most of the school fees are self-funded, with some scholarship support. Still, at times I felt like whatever I did was not practical and I should be out pursueing something else more worthwhile. 

I hope I dont turn into those psychopaths.

I feel like it was still just yesterday that we would still hangout, plan dates and travel overseas and hear each other out. I still hope one day we'd bump into each other and reconcile. We haven't talked with each other for some time now after the break-up. But I'm still waiting for your message, or call, and see if we can patch things up and get back together. I wish you haven't given up on me cause I wouldn't have done so despite our past arguments. I still miss you a lot and it's still different without you. And I wanna let you know that despite our busy schedules (under pressure) I would still be willing to understand you and just support you all the way. I'm only saying all these because I want to let you know I still want to nurture what we have been through and I still love you. Remember that when you're down, I will still be here for you.

Sometimes I wonder if you ever felt walking away was a mistake. We cared for one another and loved another deeply, albeit through vastly different forms. I can confidently say we still love one another, but perhaps in a more mellow, subtle, distant manner now. 

Sometimes it's tougher to get over someone when there was no dramatic ending - no cheating, no falling out of love. Rather, a clash in personalities and perhaps life goals and timing. Anyhow, hope you've been well, love. Stay healthy and happy, please. That's my greatest wish for you. xx.

48,"I was on my way back to work, 
after gone through quite a busy work. 
Sitting in MRT while looking at phone, 
hoping for someone who would reply when I messaged them; few hours ago.
None of them were replied, the whole day the phone was silent,
even it was not on 'silent mode', not even from family members.

Changing from MRT to taking bus, a few walks from the station.
Waited at bus station, while listening to classical,
where sometimes I am wondering about myself, 
why the young me would listen to hundreds of years of pieces,
perhaps it was the old soul of me,
looking for peace in the business of the cities.

Sitting while enjoying the classical,
a group of four young men attracting my attention;
not because of their good looks,
but their playfulness, their laugh, their stories sharing,
they are comfortable with each other.

Perhaps I am crazy for smiling while looking at them talking with each other,
until the realization came to me; I felt lonely.
It ruined my smile.
I looked away from them, thinking back how lonely I am,
most of the time working my own shit alone,
having meals all alone most of the time,
watching movies all alone,
everything I've done, it was alone all the time.

My 4 years boyfriend broke up with me few months ago,
the reason was; it's time for him to have normal relationship,
instead of gay relationship with me.
thus I am all alone without any sexual contacts since then,
I guess he's making the right decision for himself 
and I felt happy for him.

I stayed alone far from my family.
My family and I were okay,
no strain and pain in familial relationship,
but we're barely contacting to each other
where it is norms for us.

I don't have much friends,
my JC time was ruined because I admitted myself as gay,
my whole classmate alienated me,
including my ex best friends.
Ever since then, I am not simply making friends with everyone
as I don't want the pain for being alienated repeating,
over and over again.

I am all alone most of the time,
with the musics and phone as my friends,
perhaps I enjoyed being alone,
but I am not fancy being in loneliness.

Distracted from been overthinking of being alone,
the bus came and I tapped my card for entry,
going back to final destination of the day;
a house which is not a home,
preparing for the same life cycle the next day.

Well, the tutor then wrote ""log"" behind the ""difficulty"". Yay, an exponential increase made linear due to logarithms. Anyone would like to still say ""no kick""?

Not sure why I remember such things. Maybe it is exactly because it is a gem of a nugget from a gem of a tutor.

We were dreamers that no one else could relate to. 

But I am in a relationship and you were just my friend. 

They say love is a conscious effort, and I wholeheartedly believe that. So, even though you may be the most ideal person for me, my personal connection that other people can never surmount to, a soul connection unlike any other, I can't choose you. My boyfriend and I, we've been through a lot and I don't know where I'd be if it weren't for him. With him, I grew with love. With him, I grew. He is the one I want to be with.

I then realised she was doing something with her hands underneath the table. She was using her phone to look for answers. I looked to the teacher immediately, he was too engrossed in his book.

The both of us had taken the mod alone and so when we met for the first time during tutorial, we paired up and I've never felt so comfortable talking to a guy before. But sadly the moment was short-lived and he actually attended my tutorial time slot just for a make up class so I wouldn't actually see him again.

Fast forward to the next tutorial, HE WAS SITTED THERE and in my heart I was like this must be fate (ok yall confirm like walao liddat also fate but lemme have my moment LOLS) and so once again we paired up tgt and class was really enjoyable because the both of us are just two damn blur sotong making a fool of ourselves while everyone had their shit tgt. Then came to the end of class and I was actually quite sad becus the prof had told him that he can't continue to change his tutorial to this time slot again as it wouldn't be fair for the other students so it was really going to be the last time i saw him again :'( 

So after class ended he started to ask me which course I was in and all and he offered to walk me to kent ridge bus terminal via one of halls (he stayed there) as he insisted that it would save more time than the usual route so I agreed (I know sounds abit shady but IDK why i agreed also) but yah nothing happened sorry to disappoint HAHA. Then at the bus terminal I was actually hoping he would ask me for my ig or something but he didn't and we just bade our farewell.

2 years later (I'm in year 4 now),  when I was about to leave a restaurant, he came in with his gf/fiance?(Machiam a kdrama you mei you) and we actually made eye contact and I wondered if he recognizes me but I just left becus it would be even more paiseh if he didn't know who I was and I just go crash their date.

Glad that he is doing well and I am also doing well just that I am still a single pringle.

I trusted you for so long even in the midst of our problems and arguments but only to find out that you meddling with my trust. This time, I am letting everything go because you made me realized that I should deserve something better for my future in which I decided to move away from you for the benefit of both of us and for the well-being of both of us. Despite all the problems that we had, I forgive for everything that you have done wrong to me and I braced and lower down my own pride to ask for your forgiveness because at that time, I believe maybe we would do better in terms of our relationship; but I know it will end like this.

This is me to let you know that I am no longer to fight over your attention again and no longer to look back and look forward upon you from far and only this time; I craved for the distance from you by quitting myself away.

Frequently in movies, she will ask me if I’m naughty or not. She likes to place my hands on her thigh, inching closer by the minutes, when it’s not even a horror movie. Thereafter we went to take a stroll, she pointed to me an inexpensive hotel, asked if I would like to spend a couple of hours there. She wants to do ‘it’ with me. I looked at her in amazement, in disbelief that this very day arrived, not on a stormy night wherein the movies, people seek shelter but a freaking random weekend. I joked that there isn’t a 7-eleven nearby, so it’s not going to happen. But in fact, I already spotted one while we were strolling. I can sense her disappointment, her urge, that she can conquer the night, she was more prepared and mentally ready than me getting pumped up for a 24km march. You tried being pro-active, hinting me with your scantily clad attire, of how beautiful your legs and body were. It’s not that you’re not pretty, or not attracted to what you have to offer but it’s just that my ‘Guild’ needs me. Still, I’m sorry…glad that you found someone you love now

I think of her often enough, though I’ve met my other half and know that crush and I would probably have been incompatible and come into plenty of conflict. I would live for the two of us whereas she dedicates her life to the service of others. She likes being shown the way, I enjoy having the luxury of choice. She’s well liked by everyone, I’ve but a few good fellows. She probably thinks I’m a player while I believe she falls for people a bit too steeply for her own good.

Now I’m old enough not to put off things I know I should do. I would have gone for her but for the knowledge that we’d disagree in ways that won’t always be cute. I know she has waited a long time for someone and hope she meets him soon, to have for her own what her loved ones have and a few nice things. I would be happy for her.

If there was an opportunity, I would like to apologise to you face-to-face for the lack of professionalism and responsibility I had displayed close to 3 years ago because I was considering suicide after facing a huge “betrayal”. Being given the chance to lead a team of capable individuals was the saving grace while I focused my attention on work and recovered from there.

Thinking back, that guy doesn’t deserve such a response from my end and I did regret considering him as my dream guy. Thank you for asking me out for Saturday outings as we were too casual for dates. That helped me to understand that he was not the only guy that could be considered.

A few years ago, I ask the Lord who will be my life partner and that evening itself, I saw you twice on church grounds during dinner time. It would be interesting if it was arranged by Him though.

Life has definitely been very different for us for the past few years and I was led by God to visit the group that you are leading currently which is quite amusing despite the situation I am facing now.

Currently, I want to be with a guy who views me platonically and I doubt I can see myself dating anyone else until the birthday on 2021 has passed.

If He wants to use your group as a place for me to heal from my past hurts, I will gladly accept it and endeavour towards His plans for me.

Do take care of your health and your parents’ well-being for this season. God Bless!

I remember the first day I met my best friend. That was 6 years ago, when I first moved into where my current house is. It took me a while to get used to how it felt sitting on him, but as time went by, I realised that I cannot go through the day without my best friend.

71,"Amidst all the troll, relationship and faith-in-human lost confessions here, I'd like to share something positive, and hopefully encouraging. I just graduated from NUS this year, but it's only now that I feel ready to share my story. 

I grew up in a single-parent family with my mom and little sister. Throughout primary school, I was doing decently well in school and my CCAs. We weren't rich, but we survived just fine as a family. 

Everything changed during secondary school when my mom was first diagnosed with cancer. When I first heard the news, all I could think of was 'why me?'. It felt like god was being unfair towards me. I was not a saint, but I did my best to live my life honestly and did everything as right as I could. Yet, this had to happen to me. From then on, my life started to go downhill. I started skipping school, my grades suffered, mixed around with the wrong company, and committed petty crimes. 

My mom had no idea all these were happening because half the time, she was in the hospital and my teachers avoid bothering her with these news because they do not want her to experience additional stress. But finally, I was arrested by the police for shoplifting. I could never forget the look on her face when I saw her while she was bailing me out. Beneath the wrinkles, paleness and tiredness on her face, her disappointment was apparent. She was weak, in a wheelchair and was supposed to go for her usual check up that day. But she missed it because of me. 

I realised that I was being selfish the whole time. I realised that I was thinking about myself and my own suffering, without realising that my mom was the one who was suffering the most. Additionally, my sister was starting to be influenced by me because her teacher called me and informed me that she had skipped school without an MC or letter. 

I soon picked myself up, took my N levels, and scored well enough to take the O levels. My mom's condition started to get better as well. I stopped hanging out with bad company, and my teachers helped by giving me tuition in their free time. 

I took my O levels. I had the goal of going to a good JC. But it was my second last O level paper, when one of my teacher approached me after the end of the paper. She told me the news. That my mom had passed away while I was taking the exam. My whole came crashing down again. 

With that news, I could not focus on my last paper the next day. I did not score well enough to go to the JC I wanted, and ended up going to Poly. My life, once again, went downhill. It felt pointless to keep trying. It felt like I tried my best to be good, yet life just was not fair towards me. And with my mom gone, I did not have the motivation to study anymore. 

While waiting for the Poly semester to start, I went through one of my darkest period. I was contemplating death every single day. There were some nights when I was very close to going through with my suicide plan. 

What got me out of it was during one of those suicidal nights, I entered my sister's bedroom to put a note on her desk. She did not hear not hear me coming in, and I heard what sounded like crying noise. You see, my sister never cried or showed much emotions. During my mom's funeral, there was no expression on her face. But that day, hearing her cry, I realised that she was hurting just as much as I am. And if I were to die, the pain I experienced would not just end with me. It's be transferred to my sister, and that was the most selfish thing I could do.

I started to have a new motivation in live. My sister. I pulled through poly, juggling with a part-time banquet job during the weekends. And just like that, I made it through poly, and into university because of my good grades. 

We had some help from our relatives, but it was never enough for us. My sister needed school supplies, and I needed textbooks and to pay off my poly tuition fee. My social life was not the best, because I could not keep up with going out with the clique every week and spending money with them when they choose to eat pricier food. Fortunately, I made a few good friends who understood my situation. They always opt for budget options, or insisted on paying for me. One of them had a sibling who was studying in the same secondary school as my sister and was a year older, and he gave me his sibling's old textbooks, supplies and even school uniform. 

There were times when I felt like I was going downhill again, but when I looked back at how far I came, I find the courage to continue on. From someone who was arrested for shoplifting, to someone studying at NUS.

This year, I finally graduated. I was not the best in my cohort, with only a second-lower class, but it meant a lot that I graduated. 

On my graduation day, I did not attend the ceremony. Instead, I went to the place where my mom's urn was kept, in my graduation gown (I didn't care that people were staring), and stayed there while the ceremony was going on. That day was the closest I've ever felt to my mom. She always told me her biggest regret in life was not getting an education and did not want her children to meet with the same regret. I hope that wherever she is, she'd be proud. 

Someday, I hope to go back to school and get a masters or phd. But for now, the best option is to find work first, because I want my sister to go through life a little more comfortably than I did. But someday, I'll make my mom even prouder.

I've been logging into insta using the new account I'd made a few days after we parted, so as to check up on your daily stories etc for over a year. Sadly, nothing has been posted until today. A picture of you and your new boyfriend popped up my screen. I really dont know how I should be feeling, maybe sad? Nope, because i know you've most probably managed to walk out of the gloomy days and better days await you. Happy? Not really, because I realise that I still love you and regretted what I've done that hurt you in the past, when you were still mine.

But I guess simply seeing me would reminds you of out past memories which would be best to for you to forget. So I know you'd probably not be seeing this, but I just want to say something I've been yearning to convey to you for the past 1 year plus - I'm sorry and I love you.

77,"Is this seeking advice? Thank you for your time to read though.

Background, I used to have one ‘friend’ whom I love dearly and sincerely. I lost him, but he still remains as the most important person in my life, and the effect he has on my life is (italic) extreme (italic).

He is going to POP next week Saturday, yet very unfortunately, our friendship is broken and lost. I cannot go and support him, to show how severe and harsh the situation is: I cannot even drop him a message or talk to him anymore.
 
Hence the bottom line is that 1) I cannot go to his POP next Saturday and 2) I cannot even message or talk to him so there is no chance I can just appear randomly, pretending I am seeing someone else just so I can see him from afar, how he is doing and etc (Hey I am not a stalker, I respect him a lot. Don’t misread the aforementioned).

Hence, next Saturday will be a very tedious day. The heart wants to go and see him, missing him so much and all but since I cannot go = I am trying to find a way how to cope on that day, to run away from reality, anything and everything. I do not have a home due to family issues, so I wanted to hide in the place I met him (since I have so many years of history in that place).

Actually it is just my former school, good thing is that it is a polytechnic so it is a public place. I thought of hiding there and drinking my heart out (not that it works but I do not know what to do anyway). Bad thing is I am very concerned of meeting his peers. Because I have a feeling they would mock or taunt me. Bad things happened, I am quite traumatized by them to have been avoiding the place for a very, very long time. Except that I really have no other place to run or hide anymore.

Confusing right? I wrote it in my emotions so that is the truest and purest, or most accurate form but TLDR: I am struggling to cope with an event next Saturday. With no home and nowhere to go, I could only go to a place my memories were built and my life was based on. Unfortunately I risked being further traumatized by a group of people.  

What about his Post-POP week? How do I cope with the entire week?

78,"Have you read the news recently? There was an article about a parent losing her child to suicide. The child was only 18 years old. I cannot imagine how it must have felt for the parent. Bringing up your child for so many years, caring and loving for him. One day, he is just taken from you, leaving you with nothing.

When he left me, that is what I thought and what I would have done. I wanted to end my life, I do not want to live on anymore. 

But I have a message to everyone. Everyone have their own reasons, it is not about judging as we do not understand their perspective (just like how I am already fully expecting to get a lot of backlash for ending my life for another person). 

Even if you do not want to live on anymore, you might as well continue to live for the sake of living for your parents. It is not about enjoying life, or ‘living’. It is just about responsibility to make up to your parents.

Time and effort aside, the cost of raising a child could go up to $500k. Have you even ‘repay’ your parents this amount of money? = But actually they don’t want money anyway. They spend their crucial period (Age 20-30s) devoting so much time and effort to you. Money can never make it up.

How about feelings? Emotions? The news would come as trauma, potentially leaving them with PTSD. How about coping with the grief and loss of your departure?

Right now, I am trying to ‘repay’ as much as I could, spending as much time as possible with them like going out to buy groceries with them, giving them a lot of money (more than triple of what I spend), talking to them and buying them new food to try. The list goes on. 

I love you Braxton. I love you very much. I will love you forever. But I cannot die for you until the day my parents passed on. It feels like living a ‘double’ life, one façade to present to everyone else in order to perform and function normally to bring results, and my true hollow self being dragged and forced on to live.

I don’t know whether it is you who wrote the confession but I have been longing for you for so long. Ever since I started working in a new place for the past days and months, I had made alot of amazing friends who are more cheerful than you and gained alot of experience more than the place we worked together. To be honest, I am much more happy when I have new workplace, perhaps you are very happy too without me being working together with you anymore. 

This world doesn’t accept the lovely bond of both of us and you are the one who said that we are nothing but only as a friend. Only God know how hurtful my heart is when you told me such a words. 

We had fun alot to be honest, perhaps we enjoyed the time being together, along these years. But along the way, our heart changed and it makes for both of us having hard time to forget each other. Perhaps it is just a few stairs away from each other, but I am like you whom feel like it is million miles a way. 

You don’t need to force yourself to stop contacting me. I am the one who deciding to be away from you, for the sake of our hearts’ healing. You are never been as someone lousy in my eyes, no matter how much mistakes you did, I will always forgive you as you are always perfect in my eyes. 

Don’t blame it on our circle of life, as it comes from our own heart who decided to be separated like this. Perhaps because of our differences in preferences of feeling, we are ended up like this. 

Yes, we are strangers now, but I always peek at your glances whenever we passed thru each other, seeing unto your eyes who longing for being together with each other, where I have been longing for it too. 

Perhaps we are not ended well in terms of our friendship and relationship, but I always love you for the way you are but you are already have someone with you now and this is the time I will go away and forget your existence. But always remember, I will always love you. Maybe in 10 or 20 or 30 years in time, you will have a family and I might be still as a single star who longing for an Earth whom only looks at the moon, waiting for my own shine to fade.

Why do I feel like giving up? Just to let you know that it's not only about my full time work and part time degree studies, I am also taking up a language class during my weekends as well. It means that I am working full time, AS WELL AS studying in 2 different schools. 

This is the reason why I feel like giving up, because for my job, I have to standby after working hours, meaning I have a chance that I need to go back to work after working hours. On top of that, I have to attend 2 schools, 1 on weekdays at night, 1 on the weekends. Attending both schools means that I have alot more assignments/homework to do as well. Do you even understand that?

Friend A is my secondary friend and we have been friends for more than 6 years. For example: Picking up her call, meeting up in an unholy hour to chit-chat. Back then, I really appreciate her as a close friend and I am thankful that she will take up her time in the middle of the night to chat with me. 

As time goes by, meetups have become lesser due to her busy schedule. We only had frequents callings and she is usually whining about her workspace. I asked for her assistance for minor things such as referral codes. She rejected with reasonable reasons such as no apps. I understand that. Often, I asked her out. However, she rejected me with understandable reason. 

 Things started to go south when I was having financial difficulties. My family run into some problems and I asked her to borrow me some money. It is understandable if she is unwilling to borrow me $50-$100 as she might have difficulties and she does not earn much.

 I texted her again. I asked if she was willing to borrow me $20. She did not reply after constant texting. The next day, she went to the cafe which cost around $20. She was a full-timer. From that time onwards, she did not text me. I was hoping she asked about the condition of my house. I was disheartened.  Her actions have stabbed my heart.

It was all a test and I was lying about my financial difficulties. One thing for sure: I will lend her money if she needs $100. I will lend to her despite earning a penny. (part-time job)

I know that it was ended up with a very bad condition where I didn’t even talk to him at all. And I don’t know whether he is bi or what, but to be honest, there is no such friend would do extra miles like the normal couple did. But in the end, he never admit it to me at all.

Sometimes, the feeling of guilt dominates my thought where I am always feel that I disturb his time and breaching his space despite he is the one did it most of the time after the confession. But truthfully, there is no single anguish came out from him except for copious cursatives he said unto me which is normal to me.

I love being together with him and I don’t need him to do alot of extra miles for me, just being himself present in front of me should be enough. But now, his presence makes me more angry even though he was not in the same dept as mine since I transferred out, because for all the things that he did to me which was ended up so badly. 

Perhaps there is abit of anguish came out from my own self due to all the things that happened between us, but my love for him never fade. That is the one last thing I told him before I transferred out from my old dept, I told him that I loved him. I walked away with a heavy feelings, looking at his glistening eyes that tells his own unspeakable mixed reaction. He knows that I loved him and he did loved me but only as a good friend (or perhaps, he didn’t want to admit it to me).

86,"I have a story that I want to share. It is rather long, but I hope you guys have the patience to read it till the end. 

I met girl A when we were both penniless students in NUS. I was the nerd with thick glasses, and she was the happy-go-lucky girl with a smile always on her face. We studied together, ate together, went for lectures together. We were inseparable. We were soulmates. I would write poems for her, and she would feed me the cookies she made herself. After graduation, we decided that it was easier to write poems and bake cookies for each other if we lived together, and so we got married. 

Today, 10 years later, things are very different. The smiley-faced girl that I married now only has dollar signs in her eyes. I didn't know it when we were still dating in uni, but girl A is actually extremely stingy and mean. Girl A also spends most of her time causing trouble with other housewives and rarely spends time with me or the kids. In her free time, her favorite hobby is finding fault with me and starting unnecessary quarrels for no reason. There are no more poems or cookies. She claims that she dosen't have time to bake cookies, but I recently found out that she had the time to amass a secret stock portfolio bought using my money. Frankly speaking, if I had the wisdom to sign a prenup, I would have divorced her long ago.

I met girl B when I gave an invited talk at her school. She emailed me soon after for advice regarding uni choices for a future career in my line of work. At first, due to my bad experience with girl A, I assumed that girl B had dollar signs in her eyes as well and decided to just treat her as a casual fling. However, on our first night together, I was surprised that she showed up at the room with a teddy bear from home: Apparently, she was very attached to that bear and couldn't sleep without it. That was when I realized that she was actually a really kind and gentle girl, and all my fears and apprehensions melted away that night. After a few wonderful nights together, I became her teddy bear and she is now only willing to sleep with my arms around her. Till today, I sometimes get texts from her in the middle of the night, complaining that she has trouble falling asleep without me.

All the while, unlike girl A, girl B never once got into any arguments with me about money. When I brought girl B along with me for a business trip, I didn't want my secretary to know about our relationship, so I gave girl B her own supp card for her to handle the usual logistics. Based on my bad experience with girl A, I was expecting girl B to max out the card by the end of the trip. I was right: girl B did indeed max out the card, but she spent the money not on herself but on me: Apparently, she saw that my suit was old and worn out, so she secretly took my measurements while I was asleep and arranged for a new suit to be made. When we returned to Singapore, I trusted her and let her continue using the card. Even today, as the new NUS term begins, girl B continues to take time off her busy schedule to spend time with me, and we are creating wonderful memories together every day, every moment. 

Dear reader, if you are still with me, I have a confession to make: I am actually the author of post number 67924. Please be my judge: If you were in my shoes, which relationship would you cherish more: the relationship with girl A, or the relationship with girl B? Society seems to think that one of these relationships is more legitimate than the other, but as I drift off to sleep beside with a girl who hugs me the way she hugs her teddy bear, I imagine that maybe society is wrong for once and that happiness can be found in unexpected places.

87,"Hey everyone. Its my first time I have been confessing here. I wanted to share my failed love story where it affected me alot honestly. 

It is all started when I was working and on that day there are a group of students been interned to our dept. Usually I am like-I-care person and just doing my job over and over again. Until one day, I was having some issue on job and on of the guy intern helping solving the issue. I was so thankful to him but as I say, I just continue my work as usual.

But this guy ah, keep on talking to me but of course he kept introduced himself to me and we exchange numbers after. It was my first time even since I started working, I am contacting some intern student. So we messaged and call each other quite frequent. We hang out alot as well. Got one day when we hangout tgt, I asked him whether he got gf or not and he said he did, so there goes my hope. Haha. Until the day of his last internship, I was abit sad lorrr. Aftr that, I didnt contact him anymore. 

Until half a yr after, I saw he came back to our dept with a shirt and semi formal wear, I was abit shocked. He came to me and said he’s been accepted to work in same dept as me. And I was like “oh shit, there goes my love life”. So we started to contact each other again and he vid called me almost every night up to 5 hours! I was abit weird that why would he spent his time on me as he himself got a gf. So i asked him direct “how are you and your gf?”

He said “we broke up already straight after we finished school”. And i was like “Damn!”

I didnt even know how to say but we went for a meal quite a lot, we went to watch movie quite frequent, not to forget the couple seat. I dun even know whether he liked me back or not but all he did to me is like someone the couple did. But I dont want to think alot about as I prefer the latter to initiate the move. So at one point of time during christmas, we were asking each other what we want for christmas and apparently he said he wants me for his christmas and suddenly he act cute after. I said to him to stop it because he is meddling with my feelings. 

In the end, i told him that i liked him and i loved him. And that is where all the awkwardness started. I started to avoid myself from him and started to stop texting to him. After that he started to contact me again and started to talk with me again. We do the same routine over and over again, without thinking on that day. He never said anything about the day i confessed to him because i dun want it affect our relationship at work. 

Months by months passed, our relationship worsen and we argued alot on the phone. I didnt even talked to him during work. Only after 2 years of knowing each other, we did a closure tgt which was failed miserably. In the he told me he dont like me and only treated me as a friend. And what kind of friend who called me up for hours and bring me for a meal secretly without ppl in our workplace knowing about it.

In the end, I ended up requested to transferred out from my old dept and move to the new one for the sake of my own self to be happy during work without presence of him. Honestly I gave up alot of things to make myself happy again. But out of all things, I would never forget what he told me after all he did: He dont like me because I am a guy too.

88,"Don't ship people pls, it ruins everything.

In secondary school I got close to this guy and we started texting a lot. We would text all night till late and continue in school (either teasing each other in real life or texting). We talked for hours about anything and everthing. He was so sweet to me . We were best friends but tbh we were close to crossing the boundaries between friendship and bgr. I really like him and I think he did too. But things got downhill.

Everyone started shipping us and things got awkward in real life. Whenever we talk or seen together in real life, friends around us would ship. It got so bad that even our teachers knew and people from different classes knew about it as well. Gradually, our texts also got lesser and we slowly drifted. We were still close but not as close anymore. After a year we stopped talking completely. My friends would tell me to move on, but I couldn't. I think it has been around 4 years since we talked, but I am still not over him. I heard he got a girlfriend now while I'm a single pringle all this while. 
Maybe you will say that was my own fault for not taking the initiative etc. I did, but we got so awkward because of all the shipping that we would be so cautious in talking to each other and became distant. So here I am walloping in heartbreak. Maybe I need closure, but I will never know if he liked me ☹

89,"We met during BMT. You were the stern yet kind officer whom everyone looked up to, and I was the blur recruit who kept having to sign extra. I still remember the first time we held hands: It was a weekend so tekong was empty, yet you were still so shy (that was the first time I ever saw you blush!!). After POP, one lucky break after another led me to be posted back to tekong, and I can truly say that that was the best time of my life: Two soulmates sharing their lives together in paradise away from all the stress of mainland Singapore. 

I would have gladly spent an eternity in tekong with you. Sadly, I knew from the beginning that continuing our relationship would have affected your career progression, and that your wife and kids on the mainland need a husband and father. After I ORD-ed, I decided to harden my heart and break off all contact with you. It was the bravest decision I ever had to make in my life. But then again, you were the one who taught me how to be brave. As time passed, I thought I had succeeded in burying myself in schoolwork to forget you, but seeing the soldiers marching past during the NDP parade brought all the wonderful memories rushing back.

I will always remember you: my sweet soldier, my hunky boi, my first love. I wish you all the best wherever you are, whatever you are doing right now. 

Love,

I used to organize weekend camps for Sunday schools. Me being very passionate about making the camp exciting to these elementary kids, I resorted to building a haunted house experience for them, themed “the power of one”. Basically at least one person will go in and bring a key out to unlock lots of goodies (snacks etc) locked in a huge bag. Unlimited tries, max three per group. 

There was a run-down bungalow near the venue which the camp was held and I had carefully set up many stations of “scare” which would give the kids chills and make the goodies very rewarding. My friend was supposed to be the white “ghost” to appear behind the main door to shut the door and I was the “black” ghost that would appear behind a pail of murky water in which the kids must dip their hand and collect a key to unlock the goodies for the whole camp. 

Unexpectedly it was a big hit and all the kids had good fun screaming their head off (no nearby residential unit, we rented the whole campsite) and tell everyone how scary it was. 

I asked which ghost was scarier, the white or the black one. 

They replied and I could not gather enough courage to bring back the pail and other mockup items the next day from that dilapidated bungalow. 

The kids said: “the red ghost! It was foaming blood from mouth and looked so furious with red eyes!! Was really hard to ignore! We almost gave up!”

Happy Hungry ghost festival!

91,"I have been in a relationship for 2+ years. It was originally beautiful, with long term plans to eventually get married. We texted every day and met every week. Things changed when she suddenly returned to her home country after she graduated from university. From the originally almost overly attached girlfriend came a whole new person, who was always busy. She definitely did not cheat on me, though. Things got worse when she decided to fly further abroad to study in America, and even told me she plans to work there after graduation. We have discussed breaking up many times (some initiated from me and some from her), but she told me she wasn’t able to let go, instead asking for a temporary break. Is there any advice out there? I love her, but I feel so lonely and unable to follow her there (it is really expensive to study there and I come from a more humble family background, though I have tried applying when she’s asked me to. There are so many other options out there, and I have had another people ask me out, but we made a promise to each other early on to stay together. I am not sure what I feel about her anymore, I really miss her but most thoughts about her nowadays lead to much resentment that she chose to leave.

Short-term you could get almost anything you want, mid-term you could go overseas for vacation a few times in a year (those big countries like Europe, or at least Japan/Korea), long-term I want to pay your uni fees, and also give you a monthly allowance so you need not worry about funding and can focus on your studies.

But that is not enough right? When you gave me the chance, I thought that I could give you so much more. I thought of the skills I could learn and develop to aid you in the future, I thought of all the connections I could make that would help you. Obviously, money is not the only thing I could provide for you.

I want to give you all the time in my life, to stay fully solely committed and devoted to you. I want you to give a new meaning to the word ‘effort’. I have died for you once, I have lived for you as well.

95,"All those recent posts about past relationships and maintaining contact with the exes makes me reflect upon my own dating history.
I broke up with my ex-girlfriend of almost 7 years because of a stupid reason. Eventually I realised that I was actually deeply in love with her and was a fool for giving up a gem like her. I tried to patch back but it was too late, she had moved on.
Fast forward to today, both of us have found someone else. She still treats me as a friend despite all I have done and tries to stay in touch and care for me as a friend. However, I do not feel the same way as I still harbour some feelings for her. I just buried them deep down in my being so that I could rebuild my life. You see, I spent almost 8 months in near despair and misery when she rejected me last year and I do not wish to return to that horrible emotional state.
Nevertheless, I will always reply her message and help her even if it is at my own expense. I will just lie to her and myself that I am doing it out of friendship when it is the furthest from the truth.  I will then hate myself for being this weak as I will always sink into a melancholic state once she stops replying. This is despite me constantly promising myself that I should find the strength to ignore her forever so that I may truly move on and rebuild my life.  
In conclusion, I sincerely believe that exes can never be friends or should stay in contact once they break up because there will always be one party who cannot move on despite the passage of time and space

I have always been an OG since secondary school. And when I heard that the company was conducting an orientation for my first day of work, oh boy, was I excited!
On my first day, I showed up in my oversized class t shirt and shorts and brought my sleeping bag. I was aghast to see everyone in formal wear. I am like, ""you guys will be in such a rude surprise when we do water activities.""
Then, this lady showed up and asked for my name. I said, ""Ah, you must be our OG."" She said, ""no, I'm Linda from HR.""  
And then when we were all gathered, I was really disheartened that we just introduced our names and the departments we were going to be working in. I mean, where were the blow wind blow and 2 truths and 1 lie icebreaker games? Where were the forfeits? This was a very lacklustre work from Linda as an OG. 
Linda showed me to my desk. She just gave it to me. It really pissed me off. I am like, ""What? No cheer? In my time, we had to cheer for every single thing even for our food. How can you give me anything without using cheer as a form of currency!?"" She said something about this is being a corporate company or whatever. 
I was really excited for the day to the end. And yet again, I was disappointed. Everyone just packed up their stuff and left at 6pm. We didn't stay over. Then, how else can we bond if we don't bring our sleeping bags and sleep along the corridors of our office!?

In case you do not know, there is this thing called progressive training that we NSF have to go through in preparation for our final 24 click route march before our POP (passing out parade).

A week before the final march, we had our final progressive training of 16 click. However, I was on MC and did not participate. 

Fast forward to the final 24 click route march, in order to not waste everybody's time, my Encik told us to cover up the fact that I did not go through the final training so the 24 click can be carried on without problems. 

16 click in, I was starting to feel the fatigue. It was at this point I almost gave up and fall out. But thanks to the support from my buddies and commanders, I was able to persevere.

Nowadays, I think back to the times where I received incredible support and most importantly, I would like give special thanks to Pocari Sweat! The non-carbonated sweet beverage which provided me with the energy throughout my BMT.

Pocari Sweat is an ion supply drink that smoothly supplies lost body fluid that is quickly absorbed and retained in your body! I drink Pocari Sweat daily whenever I workout and it has helped me perform to my utmost abilities!

101,"Alright, since so many people are sharing their personal experiences in NS, I would like to share mine as well. It has been quite a while since I ORD’d so I may be fuzzy on some of the details, but I will try to recount them and provide as much context to them to the best of my ability and memory.

I have never been a really physically active person, so needless to say NS was a very challenging time for me, especially in the BMT phase. Running, marching, running again, countless hours of physical activity. It was an absolute nightmare for me. During my two years as a man in camp I always found myself lagging behind my peers in most of the exercises and missions we had to go through, and even though I tried my hardest, I never seemed quite able to improve.

I remember SOC during my BMT was very difficult in particular. I always found myself stumbling and falling over the most basic of obstacles, even as my platoon mates sailed through with relative ease. The Low Wall still haunts me till today, and I have no idea how I eventually managed to get over it.

However, what I would really like to recount is one particular day when we were all doing our IPPT 2.4km run. I was heaving and panting, doing my absolute best to keep up with the rest of my fellow platoon mates, but as usual I was pretty much the last in the group. While we had numerous water parades throughout the day in the lead up to the big run, I still felt dehydrated as I forced myself forward down the track. I have no idea what my timing ultimately was, but after a certain point it was pretty clear that I had already exceeded the minimum timing for passing. Still though, part of me still wanted to do my best and so for the sake of the completionist in me, I made a mad dash in the last 100 metres. I ran and ran, every fibre of my being screaming in pain from the burn of lactic acid, yelling at me to stop. But still I ran. I ran and ran. Till I finally passed the finish line. I could take it no more. I keeled over and threw up into the drain beside the track, and blacked out.

I eventually woke up some time later. But as I looked around, I realised I wasn’t in the same place as before. I was no longer on the running track, and my platoon mates, who were all standing about earlier, were nowhere to be seen. Stirring, I squinted and blinked, trying to make out whatever I could through my blurred groggy vision. 

Eventually everything came into a sort of focus. Around me was a forest, lush and green. The calls of distant birds resounded all around me. I looked down. I was sitting in a cart, hands bound in rope, that was pulled along by horse. I then noticed my companions. One of them, seeing that I was awake, looked over to me and opened his mouth to speak.

“Hey you. You’re finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there.”

I looked up and the titles appeared:

As I hear my uni mates telling me the same thing, I was holding back my sadness and disappointment and agreed reluctantly with a smile, knowing fully well that history will repeat itself again.

We used to be so close together and sharing almost everything.. perhaps except some feelings deep down that started to be hidden. But i’m so confused now with all the work out together posts and seeing how others get all her attention, but only more and more secrets get piled up between us.. she asked me whether I’m still jealous. How can I not be jealous when i'm treated like a spy but so many others in her life can have it easy and still be a part of her life? But where were all of them when she needed help?

Everyday i wake up in fear that idk today will be a day we grow closer or more distant. I don’t even know the closer we grow is a mirage or we really are closer. I don’t even know her feelings to me are borne out of guilt just because of how nicely I treated her or cause she pity me.

I’m guessing she’s probably confused too and i really want to give her time. But you see, I can only guess, but how can one not have doubts when he lives each day with her with only guesses? Sigh.

109,"I graduated from NUS a few years ago. Since then, I’d been sporadically reading NUSWhispers.

I just wanted to get some nostalgia off my chest.

Dating post-grad was not the easiest experience. I experienced a failed relationship, and also dabbled in a certain dating app. Online dating almost always resulted in either me not being interested, dying conversations, or ghost matches. One pleasant match I had 2 years ago has been appearing in my mind recently, and while we had established our distance in the “wish you all the best” way, I’d been hoping recently that we could meet randomly in a cafe one day (haha).

He was a rather charming guy I talked to 2 years ago, when I was a fresh grad and him, a final year student in a course that usually rivalled the course I studied in. We clicked really quickly, and had lots of playful banters, exchange of our daily lives, as well as fun, interesting and intellectual discussions of many different topics. I thought we were compatible in many ways, be it busy-ness (he could understand how busy I was, and vice versa), intellect, and how fascinated we were with each other’s area of expertise. I expressed that I was happy talking to him, and he did the same. He found me cute, and vice versa (although I never explicitly said that :P)

This continued for about a week before he began to shy away, but not forgetting to explain properly to me that it was because he felt tired and not ready yet to put himself out there after a recent break up. I was disappointed of course, but not bawling and all that crazy stuffs. I think I really did fancy him, maybe because of the happy conversations/times we had in that one week. Although to be honest, I had my own emotional baggages at that time as well.

2 years down the road, somehow he’s been appearing in my mind a lot. I guess when loneliness strikes, you will always yearn for that person who makes you really happy, and was effortless to keep up with. Perhaps people may say “hey this wasn’t even a real relationship”, considering we had not even met (missed opportunities earlier, and him shying away eventually), but all the memories still bring a smile to my face. If he was still available, I would seriously consider rekindling things, because at least for me I feel that my emotional baggages in the past have been relinquished.

I appreciate you reading this story till the end :) Like I said, I wanted to get this nostalgia off my chest. I’m in the midst of leisurely writing a script on Modern Dating, and having ideas of a web series like Wongfu Productions. If anyone is interested, please feel free to comment :)

An added complication was that it was her first birthday in Singapore without any family members around. It was either I celebrate her birthday with her and get a reduced grade or she ‘celebrates’ alone while I may get a higher grade.

I was very inclined towards attending the lab session and she also said she’s ok to spend dinnertime alone. However, I decided to heck it and yolo by skipping the lab session and going for dinner with her instead. She was shocked and asked why. I told her, “In 10 years’ time, my grade won’t matter. You will.” 

Needless to say, I got a poorer grade for that module for skipping a lab exam without valid excuse. But boy, did it feel saccharine.

Fast forward 5 years later, we broke up.

I'm relatively popular (have many friends and no enemies) among my cohort, I'm academically successful, and I have stable job prospects after graduation.

Naturally, most of my friends and acquaintances think that I should be a happy person. I've even had one person tell me that she looks up to me, which really made my day.

But I've been reflecting on my life over the past few months, and somehow I don't feel happy.

Everywhere I look, people seem to better off than I am. Some of them are blissfully attached, some of them are much more physically attractive, some of them have better job prospects (or are better financially equipped), some of them are massively more popular than I am, and some are simply much smarter than I am.

It's almost as if I feel lonely or even inadequate.

I know, I should appreciate what I have. I'm fortunate enough to have such supportive coursemates and not having to worry about my own finances while studying in NUS.

But I can’t help but feel anxious that at the age of 25, there’s still so much left to do. And this makes me feel so tired all the time.

I’ll admit, some of this is my fault. Perhaps I don’t exercise as much as I should, or I don’t invest enough time in personal grooming, or I don’t work hard enough in socialising or networking with others. (There’s nothing I can do about intelligence, though.)

It was tough dealing with the breakup alone and I still haven't moved on even after a few years. But, I felt that I have made the right decision, since she moved on quickly, a few months after the breakup She also seems much happier with the new person in her life, constantly posting happy couple photos and insta stories, as opposed to sad and emotional quotes when she's with me. Guess I finally understand what it means to love someone, even if it means having to let go and knowing that she will be better off with someone else.

I still remember how I was planning to invite her to my commencement ceremony and thank her for being part of my life, but I guess it's not possible now.

127,"Today, I passed by that post office in the foreign city again.

We met in our faculty's freshmen orientation camp. I was smitten by you. When the semester started, I tried all means and ways to get closer to you and know you better. Engineering multiple tutorial swaps to be in the same tutorials as you... finding ways to talk to you in between classes... inviting you to events etc. It was always one step forward but two steps backward. You would always engage in polite conversation with me until it turns slightly personal, then you would stonewall me.

However, I noticed that you would never stonewall me when you needed help with homework. My friends called me a ""doormat"" and a ""weakling"" for entertaining your requests for help. Alas, my fondness for you prevented me from drawing a line in the sand.

When it was time for overseas exchange, I was elated that we were going to neighbouring countries. It meant more chances to travel together and get to know each other better. So I thought. Those chances never materialised, but the occasional requests for homework help still flowed. I had promised to send you memorabilia and souvenirs from the country I was in. That was why I ended up in that post office in the foreign city sending a parcel containing memorabilia and souvenirs to you.

When we returned to Singapore, nothing changed. Even inviting you to attend a community service event with me did little to change the status quo. It was then I decided that maybe it was time to love myself a bit more and let others a chance to enter my heart. When we graduated, I thought our conversations would die a natural death since we were heading into different industries. Little did I know that Fate would deal yet another ironic twist. A few months after graduation, you told me that you are changing jobs, and your new job is in the same industry as mine.

Needless to say, questions about work sheathed in polite conversations continued to flow till this very day. Yet, after all this time, I have already extinguished any hope of being together with you. On hindsight, It would have been easier for me to move on if you found a partner, but your single status all these while meant that moving on has to come intrinsically from me, not extrinsically from your unavailability.

Today, I passed by that post office in the foreign city again. Unlike the previous time, I have my significant other at my side this time round. I took the chance to let others enter my heart, and I don't regret taking that chance. 

As I wrote this piece, I received yet another message from you. I have little doubt that it will be another question about work. Maybe, just maybe, I will delay my reply slightly this time round.

My story is one that’s is unique, I lived and settled in Box Hill (the largest Chinese Australian community in Melbourne), as a result I had very little angmoh friends and most of my friends are either ABCs or Singaporean students.

I am so saddened to see how many Singaporeans are ashamed of their identity so much that they will fake accents once they go back to Singapore for a holiday, not most Singaporeans overseas but a lot. Why? Life is so tough back home? I get it. But I don’t have it easier as I went to a selective school here, added the fact that I deal with everyday burdens of getting good grades and the pressure to assimilate (to find the best of both worlds). Try to have some contentment with your Singaporean identity, a few of my ABC friends tell me they want to move to Singapore because it meets their needs of balancing Asian and Western culture together.

But that said I do find myself in a dilemma where I am confused and conflicted about my cultural identity. Singaporeans find me too ‘angmoh’, angmohs find me too ‘Asian’ while ABCs see me as ‘Nick Young’... like what lmao. I do find myself being able to connect with both Singaporeans and ABCs but I feel like I can’t truly fit into either groups. So who am I? Which group do I belong to?

I posted once about the issue of work life balance about 5 months ago on January 14th, on my first day of internship. That was the day I realised what working life was like, and how hard it was. I lamented and whined about how I could not imagine myself doing this for the rest of my life. Working 8-5 everyday.

Today is the start of the last week of my internship. Upon reflection, I still feel sad that we have to work every week day from 8-5, leaving the house when the sky is dark and reaching home when the sky is dark as well. I guess that's the reality of life? I have learnt to accept this and can now see myself working these hours.

I am thankful for this opportunity to experience the working world, albeit as an intern, with little responsibilities, and to learn and prepare myself before entering the workforce a year later.

I understand it’s pseudo science and I should take it with a pinch of salt. But being someone that is often misunderstood by others, the personality descriptions really gave me a lot of comfort. I was tested as an INTP. 

When I was young, my sis (12 years older than me) used to say that I would not be successful in the future and she did not know which career path I should take. I wouldn’t be able to survive in the workplace. I was ugly, stupid, etc. 

Her criticisms actually pushed me to achieve academically. After graduation, I took up a full time position, the boss was very open minded and willing to listen to suggestions. But due to office politics( it was quite bad), I left the company after 2 years and found a new job. In the new workplace, politics is still around and I realised that my boss actually did not welcome suggestions (her reactions against what she told me during the interview). I am a straightforward person and I don’t like to beat about the bush. Should I just keep my mouth shut and accept that not everyone will welcome suggestions? I felt quite miserable and started to wonder if what my sis said was true.

He starts by introducing himself at Week 0 and sets the standards of the module in the process. Although it is true that flipped classroom might be time consuming due to the extra time spent reading up before the class coupled with Prof's insistence of not recording the lecture,  these are just small obstacles that one can slowly overcome. 

Secondly, his assignments are not that rush and gives the student adequate timing to finish the questions. He even scaled the questions down from 2/3 after getting feedback from students that the workload is too high. Now this is what I call listening to student's feedback. 

Lastly, he has an amazing team of TA (not to mention kattis the cat) backing him up throughout this module. Providing consultation slots every week despite their personal busy schedules. 

Regardless of what grades I receive for this module, hoping for the B+, I really enjoy it. Thank you Prof Steven as well as all the TA's making it an excellent module!

146,"This is a reply to Mr. Btech is better than Beng and the whole ""grades don't matter"" debate. Honestly who are you trying to fool? Grades f**king matter in our society, like it or not. Employers sort by honours class and grade first when deciding who to even call for interview.  I agree with that commenter who said that saying these things gives kids the wrong impression. Why? Because I was one of them myself, and I wasn't a kid.

I was a relatively good student out of JC, entering NUS with a >85 rp score. But during my first and second years in hall, I joined up with a group of friends who told me ""grades don't matter, passion does"" everyday. I spent increasing amount of time on my 2 NUS and 6 hall CCAs, volunteering, NUSSU, etc. Predictably my grades suffered for it, and I got a CAP 2.88 at the end of my second year which shocked my parents who always saw me as an above-average student.

Obviously they advised me to study more and quit some of my commitments. But being brainwashed by my friends, who were mostly in the same position, I just said the ""grades don't matter, passion does"" thing back to them. I graduated with a pass degree, and set out into the working world with what I thought was a world-class resume of achievements. To give you a short sample, I represented NUS in 5 inter-varsity competitions in 2 sports, was leader of 2 hall CCAs, organised and carried out 3 overseas volunteering trips, was a NUSSU exco rep, had 4 internships other than the compulsory one, and many more.

Imagine my shock when week after week, companies ghosted me without even telling me that I hadn't been shortlisted for interview. After about a month of this, I started calling back HR departments and asked what happened to my application. Most of the answers were ""your CAP is too low for us to justify giving you an interview"". But what about my long long list of non-academic achievements? ""I'm sorry, your CAP is too low"". These are words that I have heard a dozen times over the phone, verbatim, so don't you dare tell me that employers in Singapore don't care about grades.

I thought that my passion, particularly the internship experience and the organising of overseas trips, would demonstrate my worth to be employed. And I thought that I showed more leadership than almost all graduates with my laundry list of leadership positions. But you know what? None of that matters if the first barrier to hiring is ""what's your honours class"". Every person I know with first class got hired within 2 months of graduation, while I lingered around in my fruitless job search for nearly a year and spiralled into severe depression.

This story doesn't have a happy ending. I eventually got a job, but in a dead-end role (no career progression) and my salary was much lower than my peers. Your first job determines your career, since companies often look at your previous pay when deciding how much to pay you for a new job. I graduated 6 years ago, and I'm consistently earning less than others who got second upper/first class. As for my group of friends? It turns out that most of them are rich, and weren't concerned about finding a job. Some of them are doing charity work now, but most are employed in their family company in various do-nothing roles. I drifted apart from them when I became depressed, and I doubt many of them even think about me any more.

If you've read this far, then thanks for listening to my story. Most of the blame lies squarely on me for not studying harder when I had the opportunity, but I wish that no one had told me that ""grades don't matter"". GRADES DO MATTER, and if you think otherwise you'll end up like me, surfing a university confessions page and wondering about all the things you could have done differently when you were an undergrad. So good luck in your studies, and don't ever fall into the trap of thinking that grades are useless!

PS. Admins pls don't filter, I think that people on this page really need to hear this.

PPS. Also to the OP, I really hate how you always use the fact that you're an employer to talk down to students on this page condescendingly. FYI this is an anonymous page, I can say that I'm the CEO of ST Engineering with 40+ years of experience and refute all your points.

148,"Good evening to all. I'm the OP for #61516. 

For the past few days I had read through the various replies towards my post about BTech and I'm heartened to receive mostly positive reactions. But I believe there are a few points raised by various comments I should address.

But before I begin, please, please, type ""btech"" into the search bar and look at the all past post about btech. You would understand that there are students out there who do feel inferior, when compared to a BEng student. There are students who are lost, wondering whether to take up BTech. Remember that my post wasn't explicitly meant to glorify BTech. My post was to give an insight from an employer's POV and to motivate, albeit with a little bit of comparison between BTech and BEng. Because as I've mentioned, that post was triggered over a conversation that I overheard.

Some of you take it to challenge my POV and I welcome that. I have over 17 years of experience since I graduated from BEng and my POV is going to be a very direct one, from an ex-employee into an employer's POV.

Employers do not care how much hard work you put into to land yourself into NUS/NTU/govt universities.
Employers do not care how much you suffered while you are in school. Employers do not care how stress you were when you are taking 5 modules along with CCAs.
Employers do not care about the personal history and emotional baggage of all prospective interviewees and how they fought for placings.
Employers certainly do not care about your jealousy towards a particular individual who f*cked around during his younger days and managed to secure himself in BTech while you slog your life away in BEng, with a 5.0 GPA.

Remember, every hiring manager (probably) was an undergraduate once. We know the hardship. You are NOT special. We do not know you. You do not deserve our emotional attention on why you are more worthy just because you think you worked very hard for it.

Lets be practical. My company is like a bleeding wound. I need someone who can stop the bleed. Your hard work securing that 5.0 GPA and your water canoe (sorry for using you an example) CCA isn't going to help me with that.

Every year I have hundreds of students who apply for jobs. All highlighting about their GPAs and their merit achievements. Fair enough, that is all they have to showcase about themselves. Having those positive points in your resume only tells me 2 things. You are able to multi-task between school and other activities, and you did your homework before taking your exam.

When I hire an undergraduate, I expect them to think like an undergraduate. When I hire a graduate, I expect them to think like a graduate. When I hire a diploma graduate, I expect them to think like a diploma graduate. That is, you know your stuffs. Besides your theoretical knowledge on the subject, you have nothing to bring to the table to scale my company's business higher. With that piece of paper, you enter the workforce as a blank piece of paper and you go around demanding high pay while having sub-par knowledge and/or experience. Employers do not appreciate that. We need talents. We have budget. Sense of self-entitlement no? Elitist thinking that you are better just because you're from BEng?

Getting a degree is like a rite of passage for most of us. But it is a very carefully considered decision for full time working adults. Especially for long haul courses like BTech, where I'm aware that class sizes shrinks up to 50% to 60% from first year towards the last.

I do not doubt the quality that BEng offers. I certainly agree that BTech's curriculum stringency is watered down. To say that BTech students in general only want to pass is true as well. Which was precisely why I said the truth lies in the students themselves.

You can offer an incredibly quality content rich course like BEng. When you have students who graduated with flying colours, yet unable to perform their task as expected, it's a fail. You can offer a watered down BTech course. When you have student's who's goal is to pass and forget, is also a fail.

Like what one of our fellow OP said,

- Part time BTech is easier to pass but harder to maintain
- Full time BEng is harder to pass but has higher quality learning
- Both produces graduates of the same calibre, mostly overconfident but cmi


They're equally true. Whether they can bring the required knowledge and skills to the table, it's entirely up to them. To outright say that BEng is more superior than BTech is misleading. Likewise to say that BTech is inferior compared to BEng. 

At the end of the day, whoever can contribute most to the company, is favored most. (Copy, Paste)Employers looks for more than paper qualifications. The character, knowledge and skills that a BTech student presents, is worth more than a fresh graduate's first class hons. 5 years down the road, whoever can offer more of their skills and knowledge, whoever can display more achievements, goes to better places, be it a BEng or a BTech.


And for god's sake, can you students please stop with all these sexual dramas in school. Is that why my applicants mostly fail because they're more concern about having sex than actually studying. It is even more happening than K dramas.

Peace.

I'm an NUS undergrad, whose faculty does not comment on NUSWhispers often (always studying). My seniors are way too busy and don't come to school most of the time so they don't really read this page. But I do read this page for entertainment sake and let me say that I really love this page. The thought processes and reasoning evident by the unique netizens in the comment section here is well... unique. Needless to say, it is very different from the opinions and arguments which my faculty mates and I have (by many many many miles).

In my faculty, brains and critical thinking are a must if I want to communicate effectively with my peers, and not receive those judgemental ""what are you talking about"" eyes.
Here, it seems that the same method of argument does not apply! If the amygdala hijack mechanism taught briefly in school needs a prime example, most of the netizens here would be it.

Personally, the comments here are like a break from work. In school, I analyse different problems and pains people face, and how I could better help them when they consult me. But here, I look at the arguments/advice posed by netizens, and try to reason out these thought processes.

Let me tell you, the latter is undoubtedly more puzzling, albeit infinitely more entertaining.

155,"I find it hard to date local girls after returning from my university education overseas. Spending a few years living and studying abroad has somehow widened my perspective on life, and added to my experiences as a person. On the bright side, it probably means I've become a changed and better person from my exposure to the world outside of Singapore (and I don't mean the sort of curated overseas experience in any number of cookie-cutter metropolitan Singapore-esque city). But on the flip side, I find local/Asian girls impossibly suffocating with their relative passiveness, lack of opinions, a general feeling of total sheltered upbringing, sexual conservativeness, and shallowness in life, happy to just be distracted by vapid topics of what's the latest in showbiz or workplace gossip or shopping or fashion or whatever. 

Am I the only one who feels this way? Or am I holding local girls to standards too high for them to meet? I'm sure there must be local girls with strong distinct personalities, who can both give and take opinions intelligently and with conviction, who are well-read and spoken, who have dreams and aspirations and purposes in life that go way beyond surviving month to month, and who aren't subscribing to that old trope about Asian girls being sexual prudes or so passive that they need the guy to make the first move in love and in bed before they know what to do or say for their own enjoyment and satisfaction. So where are they?

157,"Hey E,

National Day was our special day. In our two and a half years together, we rarely quarrelled and communicated what we wanted of each other. You were my first and I was your second. I guess we just didn't handle our relationship well enough. 

Fast forward today, we are no longer in contact. Sometimes, I stare at our chat in Whatsapp, hoping that you initiate a conversation once again. I too have that urge but I know the time is not right. Perhaps as time passes, you will have moved on. It may be wishful thinking on my part but I really hope no matter how small, we still have a chance to start afresh, a new beginning.

E, I am ready to forgive. How about you? Can you put the past behind and forgive yourself? Can you give me and yourself a second chance?

Love,

I found out that you blocked me on all your Instagram accounts today.

I was looking through my posts with you and abruptly found out that you have blocked me. Honestly, I’m quite upset and confused. I’m sorry for offending you or anything to the point that you had to block me. I wish you would tell me what did I did to upset you so that I can improve on it because it sucks to find out that I have been cut out of your life.

I really do treasure our friendship and our times in JC together and I know we had some conflicts and misunderstandings but we talked about it and I genuinely thought that we resolved it and were okay... but I guess not. This isn’t the first time you have blocked me on a platform but when I asked you about it last year, you said it was an accident. A hopeful part of me is wishing that this is another accident too and we can finally resolve whatever tension we have between us. I’m afraid of directly asking you again because I don’t think that’s what you want, given how you quietly blocked me from your Instagram. So I hope that in your own time, you can come and talk to me about it. I don’t want to force you so I’m leaving it up to you. Please, just tell me frankly what did I do to piss you off. 

I really do want to resolve our issues because I treasure you and our friendship, RCH. However, I understand if you just want to cut ties with me because you’re not obligated to give me a reason. I’m just trying my luck and praying that you read this and hopefully, talk to me.

But then again people say it’s all the same. You fall out of love with your job all the time. Why bother to change when you have stability and predictability in your career.

I once heard that life is different once you graduate. And now I believe that one should cherish university days.

I took his class one year ago, and he caught my eye with his good look. He was passionate in explaining things to students, and I found his foreigner's English accent so cute. My friends knew and kept teasing him when he came to help me with the assignment. I felt embarrassed but also curious about his reaction. He just smiled every time, and I guessed he couldn't do anything more than that as he's doing his job. I put a lot of effort into studying the module and got the highest score in his class, I hoped it could make him notice me that way.

I wanted to tell him when the semester ended, but my insecurity got in the way. He got that cute smile, muscular build, and a much fairer skin tone than mine. This sounded shitty to write out loud, but I kept wondering if I was beautiful enough for him.

I noticed him having dinner alone yesterday and joined him. We caught up and talked about personal stuff for the first time. He jokingly said he wanted to ask me out but somehow thought I had a boyfriend as I posted a lot of pics with my brother on Instagram. I was speechless.

 I confessed to him, but both of us knew it would not go anywhere. I will graduate soon and work overseas while he stays here for at least 3 years. We said goodbye, life went on. I keep fantasizing to be with him, but there is not much I can do now.

175,"Hi I really wish you could post this cause I feel really bad I need this out of my mind, here goes!

Yesterday was NUS' open house and like everyone, I was eager to check out the various accommodations that NUS could offer to make school life more vibrant.
So my friend and I decided to sign up for a tour around Raffles Hall mainly because it was the only hall offering tours on that day.

After the tour, we had ice cream, drinks, popcorns, cotton candy which was really awesome and I really thank them for putting in so much effort!!!

So I had a drink in my hand (some sparkling drink which was really refreshing ) but I just finished drinking it and was waiting for the shuttle bus to ferry us back to UTown.

There was a guy who seemed really awkward, as he just sheepishly stood there when a bunch of commitee members of Raffles Hall walked passed him. After a while, he approached us as we were still waiting for the bus. We found out that he was also part of the committee member and he was a year 3 student who transferred from Mechanical Engineering back in Year 1 to Data Analytics.

From the conversation, I could tell that he was really trying his best to be proactive and outspoken even though I could sense he was really uncomfortable. I REALLY applaud his willingness to step out of his comfort zone to interact with total strangers i.e. me and my friend.

Afterwhich I casually said that the weather was so hot and asked if I could have another drink. He gladly took the glass bottle from my hand and without hesitation said he will get me another. (It was actually quite a distance from where I was to get the drink)

Here comes the terrible part.

While he went to get me a drink, our bus came! I tried to walk really slowly to the bus hoping he would appear soon. After a while, he did appear with the bottle in his hand. The distance from where he was and where the bus was located was pretty far. Unfortunately, I was already halfway up the bus when I spotted him. Despite the fact that he wouldn't have caught me, he still waved his hands so vigourously at me and ran towards the bus. Yeah the bus left subsequently, and he stood there awkwardly with the newly opened bottle of drink.

I could have waited for him to come but there were others on the bus too and I didn't want to keep them waiting.

I FELT SO BAD!

I just want to point out that on my part, I am really sorry and I should have waited for him and not leave him. If he is reading this and I really hope he is, please don't be discouraged and don't let this misunderstanding affect you. I really hope that you will still have the courage to approach people to make friends with them even though I know how hard it may feel. You have gone the extra mile and your kindness will be deeply appreciated!!

177,"Fun memories from NUS:

During y2, my friend and I were doing group project with another fellow. That fellow is a control freak and would try to micro-manage the 2 of us. So my friend and I decided to mess things up (our cap is too cui anyways).

Anyways, the project consisted of a presentation and a report. While he will try to micromanage us, we will always give him utter rubbish. Like copy paragraphs directly from wikipedia or random links from google search and send to him for ""Review"". When he force us to accept his suggestion and we said okay but just do it completely wrong. Example: he wanted us to find good images that can be used for the presentation, we had 1 or 2 images that seems to fit the topic while the rest were nonsense from random google search. 

I still remembered sending him a picture of a cat and said that it would fit our presentation. He replied, asking if we are messing with him. I told him it looked cute and proceeded to send him a few more puss in boots. 

Towards the end, he was pissed mad and wanted to report us to the prof. We toned down a little while starting to mess with the slides (hidden sound clips that plays during slide show). Can you imagine giving presentation with random sound effect like ""That's right"", ""Way to go"" or even an ""Aw yeah!!"" added as you made your points. 

We didn't do too lousy but sorry, Richard from FASS. It was still fun time. All 3 of us are graduating this year. Though it is likely, we wouldn't meet again.

179,"I wanted to move on very long, but after what #59073 has written, it evoked my memories once more. TLDR, I am just a jerk who would like to thank someone who once appeared in my life and taught me to be a better person.

Hi F, I am not sure if you would be reading this, since I got to know you while I was exchanging and you probably wouldn't follow this page. I was not looking for a relationship prior to this and most of my encounters with other girls ended after a few lukewarm exchanges, until you showed up. 

Despite my carefree personality, I am a totally different person when it comes to work. Literally no smiles, dull and often the epitome of looking resentful. It was only I met you when I told myself I will be ready to settle and be less carefree, even if it means my lifestyle would change and I might have to relocate. Through my exchanges with you, I got to know you better. 

Through some misunderstanding, we drifted apart. I remember you for calling me over-sensitive when I try to break the ice with you once more. And I broke your trust by telling things that you confided in me because you trusted me. I am sorry for breaking that trust. It was you who thought me what is trivial to me may be important to someone else and it could well be a secret that is not meant for others to know, not even our mutual close friends. Subsequently another round of argument because of other things made me resolute that our friendship was gone, let alone for that slight possibility of romance which might have developed. 

You warmed up to me after that, all of a sudden. I remember I wasn't responding to the hints you made, repeatedly the whole night while we were out wth our friends. It must have been hard and embarrass for you to give so many hints and it's so obvious that our friends around us would have gotten it. Even after that night, you tried to talk to me, but I started drawing boundaries - replying less frequently, deciding to hang out lesser with you and probably you could feel that I wasn't as warm as I was to you prior to that. You continued to follow my IG stories and my posts and I knew that. I just don't know how to approach you and what were you after. I was just so sure that I might not be the one for you after all and our interactions just went to as good as zero.

Now that I am back home and whenever I play truth or dare, or when I have downed some alcohol, I will try to tell myself to not share with anyone this encounter. There are just too many ifs in the process. What if I did not share out what turned out to be your guarded secret? What if we warmed up to each other at the same time? What if I actually come and speak to you despite whatever that happened? 

The worst part is just when I thought I have put behind this incident, I realised I didn't. Whenever I started to HTHT, whenever I drink, I will be regretting over my mistakes. I just couldn't find anyone that would made me change myself for her again. I think that I only have myself to blame ultimately. Yes, I am a jerk, an egoistic man, behind a front that appears mature.

I heard from my friend that you have started seeing someone. I hope that the person will treat you better than any of the guys you had. I just hope that the next time we meet again, we will be smiling at each other and we could become closer friends, if I may. 

Thank you for reading such a long post. I am not sure if this is what they meant by the first love, since we never really started. Btw F, thank you for enabling me to grow up and to be more sensitive to someone else's needs and wants. And for others out there, you just have to talk to the other person if you really want answers to your questions. Don't be a jerk like I once was.

I guess it's time to move on at last.

Your parents passed away right as I got to know you, while I was an orphan in an orphanage. You cried to me and I felt your pain. I wanted to put a smile on your face and always be there for you.

I liked you, but I never told you. 
We had another friend who liked you too. Me and him knew that we both liked you and I told him to go for it, because I felt that you liked him more, romantically. I was more of a brother to you. I could not take the step myself to try and ask you out, while he did.

I knew my friend was a very good person, someone you deserved. As for me, I had no home, no personality, no looks. I was a loner, and we only became close because you were the bubbly girl who talked to everyone.

Even though I supported him dating you, every step of the way I felt more and more pain as I saw you guys getting closer while still including me in your meet ups. Many times, I was close to tearing up, seeing how he could bring a smile to your face and just self-loathing myself. You guys got together eventually, while I disappeared away on my own choice.

I signed on and went off the grid from you guys. Deep down, I hoped you would continue to keep in touch with me, but I continuously found excuses to not show up for meetups and you eventually stopped asking.

Then last year, I received an invitation letter from you. It was for your wedding. You got married to him and you're living in bliss now. I'm happy for you guys too. I went to your wedding, stayed a while and left. You texted and asked why I left without telling. I'm sorry I didn't stay longer on your biggest day, but if I did I would have cried and ruined your moment.

It was a first love, and a one-sided love. I made an excuse that I had to disappear from your life because I didn't want to make my friend uneasy being close to you, since he and i knew we both liked you. But the truth is I was cowardly and still am. I still do not know how to move on, but I will, because I love you and he is my friend too.

Drama played out over year 4 sem 1 exams and CAP suffered greatly. I secretly logged in into IVLE to check your graduation grades and felt relieved that we both maintained our first class and pleasantly surprised to have graduated with exactly the same CAP. Thinking back, I was lucky to be in relationship with you who was crowned with a department title. I offered you my shoulders when you had troubles with your next bf. I’m sorry that I left the country for good without letting you know. I felt much regret when I was braving brutal winter and listened to your sobs at a pay phone. I looked for you in campus when I visited NUS during your grad school. Someone called out my nick name gently at library bus stop and I turned, and there was you standing. We did not talk much on bus 96. We are finally strangers. After decades, I sometimes thought of you. How it turned out. Last week, Flickr asked to check the account and there you are.

I was A student in Secondary school, studies just come really naturally to me and I do it well, being top few of my school year after year. What came as a celebration in the first year, became year after year of anxiety to meet expectations. I was once the best, any position other than being first, is considered a 'loss'. Getting second only gain me questions such as 'Aiyo, what happened? Playing too much already is it?'. While regaining my first position leaves me with, 'Ok. Good. See? Never study hard enough last time right?'. After my first year of celebration, I also lose my right to celebrate again because I was merely meeting my expectation, and showing my result became boasting.
When I got my O level results, I did relatively well, but my favourite teacher just had to come to me to question me, why I got only an A2 for her subject but did so well for everything else? As I watch my friend jumping around in joy for an A2 in science which he always did poorly in, I was so happy for him, everybody was cheering for him all. My heart was full of envy.

184,"I've been reading about the cheating sagas on this page and I thought I'd like to offer my inputs. I was in a relationship with my SO for 5 years since 16. Of course we had arguments here and there but they were nothing major, I loved him like my life depended on him. He made me feel complete, happy. But 4 years into our relationship, we argued more often, especially when I was unhappy with him speaking with his female best friend every day throughout our relationship. Long story short and I don't want to relive this memory anw, he cheated on me with her. I definitely had some fault to play towards the unfortunate end of the relationship and I tried salvaging things by trying to become a better girlfriend, friend and I took him back because everyone deserved a second chance. But the cheating episode has never been out of my mind ever since, it has been consuming me inside out. I got so insecure, worried that he'll hit her up again, worried about other girls, overthinking everything. I was on the brink of suicide and my CAP flew out of the window. I did go for UHC's counselling and I felt better, but I guess when someone cheats on you, thoughts of ""why wasn't I enough"" ""if he claimed to love me so much, how come he didn't think of me when he did it with her"" ""what could I have done that could have prevented this"" ""all those times when he said he was busy, was it with her"" etc etc never goes away and up till now I have so much of anxiety and negative feelings towards most things. Anyway, we broke up 8 months later because he felt it was unfair for me to continue in this toxic relationship that was eating me alive. Even though its been 2 years since we broke it off, I miss him very much and I constantly think back to what I could've done better. But then on most days I curse myself for being an idiot, for allowing him to ruin me. 

What was supposed to have been something sacred turned out to be my ultimate ruination and destroyed whatever notion I had of 'love'. So to all of you out there who think cheating is fine or are cheating rn as I type this, please consider the feelings of your SO and break it off with them beforehand, whether its a simple fetish or power play that you like. Is this some millennial thing to be cheating on each other? After this whole episode, I can't move on. It's still at the back of my mind and I've been trying so hard to move on and keep myself busy, but on worst nights its here to haunt me like his best friend. It's really difficult so I beg you guys to reconsider whatever you're doing. Cheating has long term repercussions not just on your SO, but on you as well.

Ever since my jc years, you've always been the one I could turn to whenever I had problems. It was probably burdensome to you, but you dealt with it. I was a toxic friend to you. When you told me about that girl you clicked well with in your newfound job, I felt a strange mix of emotions. You have always been my ""strictly platonic"" friend but when you told me about her, about how she admired your codes, about how she understood you in a way I couldn't, I felt jealous. 

It was then I realised the root of my toxicity was not because I felt you weren't good enough for her (what I used to hurt you) but the fact that I caught feelings, and I didn't know what I wanted to do with those feelings. Ever had the feeling that someone was more than a friend, but less than a lover? That's how you were to me. 

You don't know how it kills whenever you asked me for advice to ask her out because I was, well, just a 'bro'.

I ultimately ghosted you because I wanted to move on, and I know moving on means I can't hold on to this platonish (or not) friendship. It hurt you deeply. But I'm glad things happened the way it did. I found out from a mutual friend that you are happily together with her. I have also found my significant other whom brings joy to my life everyday. Things had to fall apart for better things to fall together I guess.

I still don't have the courage to ask for your forgiveness for the way I treated you. But I hope you don't live your days wondering what you did wrong, because it was never about you.

It's tracing itself to years ago, the first chocolate I received from you, the first conversation we had, the first message you sent me, the first time I thought I felt something when you told me about your relationship problems. I repressed it. I don't deserve to be loved by anyone, much less you. 

I miss you very much. I miss the conversations we would have, the late night typing away on the phone for hours, just lying in bed and constantly trying to out-wit each other with the funniest replies or delving into the deep stuff of life. 

Things felt so comfortable with you. I could say anything and it wouldn't matter what it was, you always knew what I meant. I love it when we both type the same thing at the same time because it just clicks. 

We could stop talking for long, long months and every time we reconnect it feels exactly the same. We continue from where we left off and it seems as though the dynamic has never shifted. 

I didn't have the guts to leave my partner. You didn't ask anything more from me, always silently understood and backed away when you felt that you were coming to chartered territories you shouldn't intrude. But you already did, and I kept trying to say ""we are just friends, I'm just doing this cause we're friends"" but I was in denial. I didn't want us to be just friends. 

I didn't dare to ask for more because I know you wouldn't fall for me. I know, deep down you would never like someone like me no matter how well we hit it off. We are just friends. 

We just weren't meant to be a pair because in so many ways, we are universes apart and I don't see the gulf that separates but I know it exists. You love crowded places, new adventures, thrilling nights and cold beers and I can't handle noise or people, preferring to spend solitary evenings with a book. You're loyal, outgoing and so optimistic it's blinding. I'm bordering on suicidal nihilism.

Sometimes I see you around in school but I actively avoid you because I'm just too scared to talk to you again. I don't want you to feel like I'm using you. I feel ashamed. And guilty. I don't know how long I will feel this way. I wish you would just talk to me again, but you never start conversations with me since years ago and I think that is an indication of how you feel about me. 

I wish we could reconnect. I wish i could tell you how I felt about you just so you know - just so I could finally let you go from my heart and bury what would never happen between us. I wish i could spell out my true feelings - for myself. To at least be accountable to myself. 

Typing this is actually giving me a stomachache in the middle of the night.

191,"This is a message for my ex. Let's call her V. 

We were together since JC days and we survived NS. But didn't make it pass uni. I was a really bad boyfriend back then, lots of emotional blackmailing and unfair treatment. It was always about me. 

But thankfully one day, because of a very big event, she decided to break up with me and she broke off all forms of contact with me. Which was good actually for her otherwise I would have just kept on bugging her.

Recently I saw her wedding photos on Facebook through some mutual friends. To be honest, I am very happy for her. She looks happy. Though I find it ironic that she married a regular when my dream was to sign on but it never went through.

I just want to wish V all the best. It's not easy in the sector you work in so hang in there. And I hope your husband treats you much better than the way I treated you. Thank you for those years that you treated me so well with so much patience. I am better person now.

192,"Seeing all the posts from ""nice guys/girls"" on here, I thought I should write my own and see what you people think. 

I'm not a nice guy. 

I don't have a chiseled bod; what I have may best be described as average or dad-bod. I'm not Kpop boyband-level of handsome with my looks, but I'm the guy next door with that spark in his eyes and a small smirk curling on one side of his lips.

I have a checkered personal history and engaged in a lifestyle of hedonism and casual sex with multiple partners, both male and female and those in between. I was fully aware of what I was getting myself into, I valued the sexual lessons and practice I got from all those experiences, and throughout all those years of singlehood hedonism and player life I've made sure to keep myself safe and an eye on my sexual and physical health. Thankfully, I'm fine. The upshot of it all is that I can safely say I am very talented in more ways than one to pleasure my future partner in bed. 

I have a temper and I don't trust easy. But if you get my heart then what parts of it I have left is all yours, and yours only. I've no intentions of dating for the sake of it and loyalty/commitment is a non-negotiable criteria I hold myself and whoever I love/am loved by to. I cannot abide cheaters and I cannot abide serial daters, and God help any of my partners if I find out they are cheating on me because I don't give second chances and I will always have a Plan B to get my own back. I'm not good with pacifying girls with cute gestures and wheedling, but I'd like to think I'm the solid shoulder they can rest on when they need comfort most, as well as a strong set of arms to pick them up when they're down and need someone by their side. 

I'm not a nice guy. Not one of those guys from a Korean romance drama, or Augustus Waters from The Fault In Our Stars. 

I'm Liam Neeson from Taken. I'm Severus Snape from Harry Potter. I'm Tony Stark from the Marvel universe. I have a great deal of history and scars in my past. I'm not perfect. But I'm real, I'm working on myself, and I know what I want in life from a future partner. I want someone loving, adventurous, non-judgemental, loyal, committed, not a shrinking violet, someone who wants me for the potential she sees in us combined and not who/where I am right now in life. 

So why's it so hard?

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/first-fully-designed-and-built-in-singapore-bus-launched

If you'd remember, I did say something about ""Hey, please look out for the bus I'm gonna build, it'll be on the news!!"", like, 2 years ago, but it... was a no show.

Out of curiosity, I recently googled your name (yeah, creepy, I know, but I really was curious on how you're doing), and well, you're doing well in LTA... As expected (Uh. ""Stanford"", if not enough clues to who you are). 

Since then, I've resigned. Perhaps, getting your first choice in life is not as sweet as it seems. A first choice, perhaps, is either a choice out of practicality, or an over- glorified piece of white bread. Nevertheless, it is the interest to tinker, and play with things, that will drive me to carry on with that over-glorified white bread. I mean, f you're bored, you just need to spread kaya, or put meat on it, right?

I suppose, that I am writing this, to a person whom it will never reach, to that person who doesn't remember who I am anymore, as a form of closure bah. I am writing this, because I need to let go, to become more mature, to make space for compensate for the lost time I spent pining for the many others who never once looked back no matter how much I wished and prayed, to grow.

I realise now, that even if I meet you today, at this time, you won't be able to recognise me. I will not know what to say to you any more.

Hahas, but either way, ehh, 欠扁 girl, the world is big, I don't suppose I'd need to tell a person who travels more than me, but as my family always says, 有缘再相见. If fate allows it, may we meet again.

Paying bills and caring for children only applies if say, you're living on your own. Most graduates starting out still live with their parents. 

And on OT, if office hours really ended so late in Singapore, why is our peak hour of crowded MRTs usually at around 6pm and not 8pm+ or 10pm? In fact I hardly see any white collar workers left going home once it turns dark night. Seriously. As a uni student, even I'm coming home later than my parents most of the time these days. Meanwhile I I have a parent that comes home very consistently at 6-7 and he's earning very decent pay. After coming home, he usually just watches Youtube all night.

Is it just nostalgia that has us as working adults missing school life? And on the bright side, you're being paid. You'e earning money, unlike a student instead paying to work. Doesn't that offset whatever extra misery you may think an office job gives?

The reason is simple. The sex did not turn out as good as he expected. Could be because he’s a virgin with unrealistic expectations or you weren’t good in bed, etc. For #57574, both reasons could have applied to your context as you both were virgins.

There could be other reasons as well. I once met up with a foreigner through a dating app and we hooked up. The way she made out with me was kinda gross, and being a virgin she was inexperienced, so the encounter was really bad for me. She wanted to meet up again before she fly back but I ghosted her.

A girl friend of mine who did an exchange in Stockholm once told me that “people there are shy... they go for drinks and hook up... if the sex was great, they would date”. That sounded ridiculous to me back then as I was still a virgin but now I can totally relate.

I will be so very kind and caring to that person, to trust that him or her deeply; I will love that person with my entire self and life. If I had that someone, my character wouldn't be this terrible and miserable, I might become a totally different man; a man with bountiful softness in heart.

But no, I had no one then. Those grey days when I walked with poverty, despair and suicide plans, I walked alone in great pain, and barely made it to the end at NUS. I paid the price for my foolishness - that is my trust and dependence on the family, well biological ties don't guarantee closeness - and I've, sadly, learnt to be cunning and selfish, to be polite and pretentious, to work for people of all sorts. Now I'm certain that I can take good care of myself, I'm certain that I don't need to beg for mercy from anyone. 

Ironically, with this new found strength from within, I'm becoming more patient and compassionate towards others. My gentle, easy going and ""listener"" attitude seems to have won me more friendliness from people. I've learnt not to comment on emotions and don't eager to offer ""solution"". I'm unwilling to hurt anyone with words, because I unfortunately know the pain. Such is my comedy of life, and tragedy as an individual.

I told him I had lost my memories before I was 5 when I was only 7 (had a playmate, who knew me but I had no impression at all, even when I was 7)

Told him how I accidentally shat my pants on the day he was born (oh boy, I was so ashamed and humiliated over my growing years)

Told him how at age 7, how I had traded a dollar for 10 dollars from this really cute girl who was my tablemate. (I felt really smart when I went home for getting a bargain. Got scolded by my dad and we traded back). She had cute cheeks (until now, I am still fond of girls with cute cheeks ????) and I think she's genuinely my first crush. Unfortunately we didn't speak when we split classes in P2 or 3. Except once I think we PM'ed on facebook during P5. Then nothing happened haha. (I think before I graduated primary school, I was thinking about her)

Haven't shared many sins that I committed later in my growing years, when I was 16, when I was 18. Made many mistakes which I regret.

I hope my cousins and kids, as innocent as they are now, continue to grow to become aspired. But don't make the mistakes that I made, haha.

It's raining and it's midweek, so one of my interns told me about this post and it hit me dearly to heart. Wanted to give two cents to my juniors to gain have a wider perspective. Was from Fass and majored in economics and philosophy (closest there was to PPE about 6 years back) - would this be considered getting caught in the same trap twice according to OP haha. 

Left nus with a regular honors. My grades were decent at best compared to my peers, but I managed to clinch an average paying marketing job, before my graduation actually. Fast forward till today, I'm sitting in my personal office with my name branded on the glass wall in the heart of cbd. Unfortunately I can't divulge my roles and where I am for obvious reasons but my ex nus/ntu interns would definitely know my story. Currently a partner in one of the bigger consulting firms.

Hardwork, network and even more hardwork is what I had to put in and fight for to get to where I am. Countless forgone weekends and sleepless nights was the price. Getting a reputable degree can only give you that much head start. Many of my clients were ex fass graduates and some were even from fortune 500 companies.

To my fellow arts undergrads  juniors, every discipline is important. Most hr departments hire across various disciplines, they would be unwise not to. Hardwork and discipline is the only mantra you should get an A+ in. Cap5? Probably not as impt.

218,"Sitting inside the ever-so-crowded Starbucks once again, I cannot believe that I am back here more than a year after the end of my undergraduate days, with a Masters to spare and uncertainty at the top of my head. And I'd thought I'd just be back here in Utown for a day or two, but it had been two or three days every week since that return from my year-long adventure 11000 kilometres away.

It's as if I'm 'omnipresent', once again.

For I cannot escape the reality, that university has always been a comfort space for me, to rethink and re-calculate my direction for the present and future.

It was in NUS where I roamed around with great aplomb, taking pictures and memories with every passing year. I still fondly recall the rush of adrenaline that sinks in with every orientation camp; where the youthful energy that I see in the eyes of every university student sinks into me, where it promises me that there is hope in this generation that I belong in, where we have the capacity to make and change the world and turn it into a better place. I fervently loved every photograph that I made in this university landscape, so much so that it had inspired my ensuing research, for it became something that had become a part of me for the rest of my life. And I feel so privileged to have known thousands of people of whom I will regrettably never know in detail, yet who pops out at every corner of the school and greet me with an enthusiasm that had worn off from my soul, a greeting that reminds me that I did something impactful, meaningful, and possibly noteworthy in nature.

In NUS had I managed to reclaim and rebuild my social standing, from the days of my wretched past school life. In NUS had I managed to find an inspiration and a way of contributing to society, and remind myself that I was actually somewhat important and had the potential to change and influence the world somehow, even in the midst of my current uncertainty that lurks in me as I navigate another job interview that ends in failure. And in NUS, had I managed to find a faculty so worth defending and of which had I managed to contribute a geographical and 'photographical' history and made a research interest out of it. I had done what I did, pursued my photography adventures here time and time again because I owe my rather crazy - and tremendously brilliant and colourful - faculty for all that they had inspired me.

And I will owe this, for the rest of my life.

For sometimes, it made me cry inside with tears of joy - and tears of self-importance. For I am as vulnerable as so many of you out there - the aspiring busker, influencer or henna artist, the self-doubting entrepreneur or the future public/civil servant and MOE teacher that propagates around me ever so often. I, like many of you, crave so furiously within for that recognition and reassurance that I always felt I lacked, of which I still feel in short supply with seemingly infinite deficiency. But as I look back on every poignant orientation camp that I've talked about endlessly like an old person on his/her last decade of his/her life, I cannot help but thank every senior and junior who had been a part of this amazing journey of mine, whenever I run into each of you in school or otherwise. This is what I owe all of you, the you who's struggling to stay afloat in finals that's concluding really soon and in every academic semester, the you who straddled into my life path or photograph or geographical landscape, the you who were part of this university fabric, the you who somehow inspired this very vulnerable soul who just wanted to fit into society and yet who constantly felt too different, too out-of-place, too dispensable. You, are so important to me, in words beyond essays, in words beyond photographs, in words, beyond existence.

Now here I was earlier yesterday, sitting in the Utown Green sipping another cup of bubble tea, staring out into another night here and enjoying the silence that I feel with utmost ease. I'd learned to be comfortable on my own and enjoy my personal company in a society that's in constant flux and endless change. I'm still juggling my personal struggles in finding a job (it's been 3 months and I feel like I'm not trying hard enough while doing so in vain), hearing of my contemporaries and juniors getting married or engaged a pair at a time, and feeling my batchmates in university grow increasingly distant and completely exclusive with every passing moment of work life. It's as if, I'm always left behind time and time again. Yet I find it alluring - and addictive - to be quite different, sitting here and finding my feet in a space that I also call a home and an atmosphere of recovery. My time in the picturesque and comforting English seaside towns and that peaceful Swedish cemetery had further trained me to ease my soul, and I hope that you all could feel the silence somewhere and somehow, that comforts you like it has done so for me.

I am still fighting my daily battles for my relevance in society, for the pursuit of something that reminds me that I still matter. But this university is the place where I continually seek to rebuild myself, and remind me of glorious and fantastic days past, and the people who were once here and are still here, but of whom will move on, slowly and eventually, like the rustling and fall of leaves with the flow and passing of every season or moment in time. 

To all those who had been a part of my life here, in materiality or in spirit, in space or with time, I wish you all the best once again. You are all in my heart in one form or another, and thank you so much for giving some of the best days of my life. Thank you for reminding and affirming me that I can do something in this confusing world.

I owe this community too much for me to let it go. And I'll never let it slide, for the rest of my life. It means the world and everything to me, and hang in there, wherever you all may ever be.

And I'll be forever grateful.

Always :)

Who knows, maybe you've gotten married already.

Well, I won't be surprised if you don't remember who I am anymore, as with many other people, but hahaha, you've left quite an impression on me, so... I remember you. Not sure if the impression I left on you was positive.... *looks back* yeah... Don't think it's that good.

So, it's been a while, huh? I'm here to tell you, that sorry for being a few years late, but do watch the news on Friday, Dec 7th, or Saturday, Dec 8th. I did say something about building buses a few years back, eh? And I hoped that you'll see it.

Well, after many delays, and much of literal blood, sweat and tears, I've finally able to show you what I've built (aside from that modification I made to the nus shuttle buses, the front handrails are pretty small and unnoticeable, but hey, it's something). 

It's not much, it's a type of bus, not electrical or anything, nothing fanciful, but one day, I hope that you, and my other friends, will be taking one of the buses that are built under me.

Or helped to build. My colleagues and Production Supervisors worked, and pushed alongside me for this one. 

Oh, don't worry about replying, though. I uh, don't visit here often, and I don't have a social media account (aside from Google, because Youtube). In other words, you pretty much can only find me in person (I issue you... a challenge, I guess? If fate allows our paths to cross again, it'll be interesting to observe you again as a friend.

Anyways, if it's any clue, I'm an idiot who drew on the whiteboards of the PC Cluster in Engineering often. Who had, and still has, a lot of logical flaws.

226,"Man, in my entire Uni life I never expected to make the best friends I had in my final years. Just a shame some of them are graduating earlier just as I met them. I think part of the sadness kind of is because I never really had friends in Secondary school or JC, so I never got why people were so sad when it ended. So, it is kind of like my first time experiencing it, truly missing having the time to spend seminars together.

I remember in my high school day, my friends and I could just share anything, from coursework related issues to daily life drama. Whatever we had, we knew that the others would be there to listen and lend a hand. But now we are apart and even though I tried, my uni friendships just sort of fall apart. Groups exclude me in whatever they do, I don't feel ok to share and I never dare to ask their help since I am afraid I am a burden, but I always try helping in my ability. I don't know, I just feel like if I try to seek out, they will just take a step farther away.

228,"Not even sure this will even reach you, and not sure that you'll even know it was me, but I guess it's worth saying.

After this year, our school will close down for good, and I guess that will be the last place with our memories that will close up. I really enjoyed my time with you.

I know we were both in bad places at the time, and that we were in really bad relationships at the time too, and I guess we both just sought comfort in someone else who knew what it felt like too. I knew she was cheating on you, and I guess I just wanted someone who knew what I was going through as well.

We were both misguided people. The first time I saw you I thought you looked cool with that camera, running around taking photos; you looked oh so popular, stopping every now and then to talk to someone and you seemed well liked by the teachers, your seniors and your level-mates. Has it really been 5 years since that day in J1?

I wanted to get to know you better. So I asked you to help me and my friends take a photo, and well, things took off from there. We spent afternoons studying together, and we told each other stories that we thought would never get out. We joked about everything, from the ugly bluish-green of the uniform to the strange expectations of the principal to random posts on confession pages (how ironic it is that I'm posting this on one) When she left you on read for a month I was there to cheer you up, and I guess it was then that our moments of weakness started. We just wanted some human contact, having been deprived of it for so long, and I guess having someone who understood so close by, it was hard to resist.

I think we both knew that it wasn't meant to be. But I caught feelings for you all the same. Every time you left my front door at the end of the day, it felt like I was missing something.

I distanced myself from you in J2, and you got involved with one of your CCA mates. I wondered about it, whether I should make a move on you, because I couldn't stand the sight of you guys being together. But I didn't. I was too scared to make that move.

And then it happened. Apparently your CCA mate hadn't broken up with her boyfriend yet before getting intimate with you, and things turned ugly. And I wanted to be there for you, but I didn't want you to see me as desperate, or for you to be seen as some fuckboy who changes girls oh-so-often. But we lost contact. Your Instagram disappeared in J2, and only recently have I found your new account. 

You're happily attached now. I guess I'm just too late.

I wish you all the best :), I hope we can still be friends, someday, and you can maybe introduce me to your girlfriend as a friend, because I guess that's as much as I can hope for now.

I'll just try to get over you as best I can then. I guess I'll have more chances to bump into you next year when Techno closes down, and if I do, I hope you won't be a stranger. You don't have to say anything, or even acknowledge what we were, but I hope we can still be friends. Hopefully I'd have my feelings for you all sorted out by then.

Actually what they didn't know is that I've been seeing a psychiatrist throughout my studies. I actually have horrible anxiety, I can't sleep well and I'm always worrying about something.

I worry about whether I can manage a job with my condition. I worry about my family. I worry about a whole lot of other stuff. It feels so crushing as always. It is even more painful because I need to pretend that everything is fine - who will want to hire such a nervous wreck like me?

231,"I feel really sad being completely alone in uni. There's no real friends to be found here. The only thing that has me going is seeing some people also eating alone in the canteen. It's at least better than seeing no one eating alone back when I was in sec school. Such  a thing was absolutely non-existent back in poly and sec school.


I admit though, I'm kind of like a half-retard that can't keep up with conversations so I've never been good at socialising. But it's also that and a slew of bad decisions I made, one of which was coming to NUS in the first place.


I really regret not applying for any hall or RC but I guess none will likely accept me anyway, unlike NTU where it's confirmed you'll get a slot. I really wanted to live a vibrant campus life living alongside fellow schoolmates but hey, my achievement record sucks, so I guess I'm not qualified enough for this 'vibrant campus life' in NUS. 
Even if I applied next sem/next year for hall/RC, what does it matter?


Meanwhile I joined tried joining different CCAs, one of which hardly meets at all and is practically non-existent to me.  

Groupmates are just hi-bye friends and relationships just slowly strain away when they see how incredibly stupid I am and how stupid I speak.

Classmates shun me since I act like a half-brained idiot and constantly screw up in class and what friends I try to make never really become friends.

 While these people can talk and laugh with each other, when they speak to me, it's always in some formal tone like speaking to a stranger. Not one person has ever treated me more than that apart from my family. Never in my life. That's who I ever am to everyone. 10 weeks later and still treated like a 'stranger' by everyone.
 
It's been years but I'm used to it by now so no, I'm not depressed. I'm literally immune to depression at this point. Funny, huh? To those of you struggling with loneliness too, don't worry, you'll become immune to depression eventually. You won't feel that heartache that much anymore. 
Society is created that way. Those that can socialise will always win. Those that can't will just get worse and worse.

232,"When I was with my ex, I was deeply unhappy. I didn't want to admit that I was unfulfilled and depressed because that means i had to also admit my relationship was a failure (or on the verge of failing) and it was frightening to know that I was going to lose something that meant a lot to me (at least it DID mean a lot to me). 

There was a period in our relationship that was particularly strained. Every night we quarrelled on the phone over trivial things.  Every time we met, it always ended on a sour note. Hectic schedules and other priorities prevented us from being there for each other when we needed support. It was the rockiest point of our time together and I felt so utterly alone that I knew I needed to reach out. 

I have this friend I used to be close with and slowly drifted apart after graduation. I really cherished our friendship and the conversations we had. I reached out to this friend after a long time of not speaking to each other, and we bonded really well. It felt like we fell exactly back in place where we left off. The dynamics were the same. We got each other's jokes. We could confide in each other without the fear of judgement. I remembered how good it used to feel. 

I got the warm fuzzy excited feeling of anticipation - the thrill of a renewed bond, the emotional satisfaction of a fulfilling companionship after such an extended period of emptiness despite being in a relationship. A spark was re-ignited in me.  I felt alive, and it wasn't all grey and dull and sad inside I saw bits and pieces of colours. Of hope. 

I think it was then I realised I'm actually doing a heinous, abominable thing - not only had I emotionally cheated (no excuses regardless of how brief or how unconscious it was) but I had also exploited the companionship this friend was willing to offer. This friend was loyal, sincere and kind - almost to a fault. I know this friend was not  romantically attracted to me but I couldn't help feeling the way I did.   

When I realised this, I was absolutely disgusted by myself. I hated myself to the core. How could I do such a thing? It's being extremely unfair to the two persons i care about and that is not okay. 

I decided to delete that friend from my contact list and suppress all urges to get in touch again. I never told my ex about it. 

Keeping it a secret was an overwhelmingly horrible feeling and I continued to be enveloped in disgust and contempt at the kind of person I am, the kind of person I have become. 

I have never clarified this matter with either of the parties involved. And to this day, I still feel guilty about it - even though I believe none of them truly cares anymore. 

I don't know how you will ever know this is for you. I guess i can only pray that the telepathy that used to exist between us remains intact. 

I just want to say I am really sorry for the way I treated you and our friendship. It's a horrible move on my part, and I acknowledge my mistake. I am learning to cope with being on my own and control the instinctive urge to find someone, anyone to fill the gap and silence. Now I force myself to sit with loneliness, to befriend it, to understand its core - and to overcome it. 

I hope that wherever you are now, whatever you are doing, you are safe and happy. But I  know you will be okay. 

I wish you nothing but the best in life. And if we ever speak again, I promise I will treat you the way you deserve to be treated. 

TLDR: don't take advantage of people's kindness to compensate for your own emotional needs

I lost it around the afternoon after my lab in the morning at E4-03-07 (Digital Electronics Lab). My routes can be traced from E4-03-07 and to E3-06-11 and then to EA level 2. I only lost it this afternoon :(

My route was probably E4-03-07, then I took a lift to E4 level 5, walked past some study benches and LT1/2 and towards the toilets near E3-06-08 which is also near a water cooler which is next to a staircase landing. Then I proceeded to E3-06-11 for a tutorial I wanted to ""crash"", but the tutorial was cancelled so I went to EA level 2 (via passing by LT7) and then I realized my bottle was not with me when I was at EA.

Although it is just a water bottle, it is something I have grown sentimental towards over the course of a few months. I got it during a holiday to Melbourne during the summer break.

I know maybe it does sounds funny, but this water bottle is my favourite water bottle :/

On the other hand, there is also the fact that your friends might not be able to write anything in the written final if nothing sticks, which apparently for programming modules like this requires one to sit down and think through what is really going on. Yes, maybe guide them a bit, but do not cross the line which one commenter of your post said. Maybe don't show the actual code, but give a flowchart(bearing in mind that 'boundary')
And apparently this is not as bad as CS1010E. Not sure how things would be very different if EE stuck to that. But then it would be probably less painful since you would get into some C in IT1007 part 2 with some experience in Python.

236,"#53863 To the guy who posted about having no friends: I certainly can empathise with u as I'm a loner myself too. You are certainly lucky to find a group of mates in army. I graduated from NUS 4 years ago and am happily married now. I feel that it would be good to share my experience here since this topic was brought up. Since young I am always extremely introverted and shy. This means not only I feel difficult to approach people, I have also no motivation to make friends. And this goes on in a vicious cycle for years. From primary school till university, I have zero friends and social life. Because of my personality, I find it extremely hard to socialize in large groups. Even on 1-1 with people, I always find that I run out of stuff to talk in a few minutes. I lived life pretty much in silos and spent almost all the time at home. 

Most of the precious few friendships I had are based on practical reasons e.g. project mates or colleagues and immediately died off once the activity is over. Other friends are mostly hi-bye friends whose friendship never progressed past a certain point. I find that as I age and mature, I do gradually overcome the shyness part but I am still the introvert I am. This means I love to spend time alone. I am working now and while I am able to get the job done with colleagues, I am never truly friends with them. I felt very lucky to have met my wife in NUS (she's a fellow introvert too, I met her by chance and it does make it easier to interact between 2 introverts but that's another long story). Now apart from my wife and family, there's no other person whom I can truly have a friendship with and enjoy the time together. I certainly have accepted myself for who I am as I know that deep down, I am still the introverted loner I am and that part will stay with me for as long as I live. I believe every one has some part in them that they might not be happy with. But it's more important to appreciate the small little good things that come into your life and be grateful for what you already have, and not mull over what you don't. Best wishes to you and hope that you'd be able to live life without regrets.

Just to add more about my experience. I found during CCA talking to expats easier, cause I can talk to them like how it's like to live here.

Genuinely, it sucks when I beside 2 people talking, and then yeah I just can't get into their conversations. There were times I tried looking at people talking hoping they will mention about me so I can say something, but often it doesn't happen. So I ended up giving up. Maybe sometimes in groups of people Im there, but I feel drifted away. I don't know what I can say so I end up keeping quiet. Maybe sometimes I finally think of something to say but before I can open my mouth, someone else says something, and I'll be intimidated to say anything and end up quiet. 

My nature is passive. I've admitted to my NS friends, it was easy to leverage my position as a more experienced guy to approach them and make contact, and we somehow become friends. If I'm thrown into a pool of fresh people, I try to be open by mixing with them but only to find out I'm too quiet, and a poor mix.

I told them, I know how being alone feels like so I found the importance to reach out to the good people.

Year 1 Semester 1. My grades are failing (despite me using most of my rest time to read and study), I don't have a social life. People are mostly hi-bye for me in uni.

I self-depreciate myself to make fun of myself in front of people. Not entirely a joke but somewhat spoken with truth. I am clumsy, my brains don't exactly function (Iearning is genuinely difficult for me), below average-looking. I probably fit all the qualities as an ""unattractive person"". I haven't had the guts to play sports (I do PT only for exercise). I haven't had the guts to like someone. I feel everyone has a quality I don't have. Maybe the only thing positive about me is that I am secretly filled with emotions, and I am willing to listen to people open their hearts to me.

I can foresee when I'm thrown to work, I might be a loner simply because, I lack self-esteem, and the ability to socialise. To be honest, the difficulty, even as a year 1 feels overwhelming to me, and I fear whether I might end up getting expelled for weak grades. I try hard in studies, I try hard in mixing with people if I can, only to find I'm extremely poor at it.

Move on with life, I was told. Adapt, I was told. I try, but it just doesn't get anywhere. At this age I'm probably 1/4 of my life, and here, I feel my best days are already past me.

Thank you for your time reading this humble confession. I am thankful I have a shelter over my head, I don't starve. But genuinely, I don't have a life. And deep in my heart, there's a huge hole. It's empty.

Story 3: this is something that still embitters me to this day. When I was working in Singapore in a shockingly average research job for a shockingly average salary, I rented a room in an HDB owned by a Muslim Indonesian family of three. The husband was a worker in Jurong West food court; salary was somewhere in the 1000-1500 range, according to similar job postings. The wife was a housewife with a bad pair of legs and not so good mobility. The only child was a secondary school student. The child was probably on some sort of financial aid (I saw a sticker for such service). Another I noted was their very late dinner/family time. Food Court workers in Singapore go home very late (the food courts open until quite late). The family dinner quite often included leftovers the husband brought back, as a result, the family had late dinners (~12pm). Think about this for a second, the child was in secondary school; when do secondary schools starts? How much quality sleep could she got? She probably made up for this by early evening naps (I notice she sleeping in the living room couch, which I passed by going to my room).

What embittered me was what happened shortly before my departure from Singapore. When I left, I cleaned the room spotlessly and nothing was broken. The landlord checked the room and agreed to pay me back the deposit (one month of rent). He, however, cited difficulties in getting the money: “I have 200 dollars in my bank account”. He did noted that I was flying off and to this day, he did not pay me back the deposit. I still have the agreement he signed and if I have time, I can definitely get it through Small Claims Court. However, doing this will cost me more than that paltry deposit.

During the time of my departure, there was an effort to slow down hiring of foreigners for middle-class type jobs, mostly due to Singaporean middle-class types decently vocal complaints. I have no problems with them doing that; it’s their countries and their political systems. I spoke to the Executive Director of my Institute and he confirmed the situation that A*STAR was prioritising my kind of jobs to Singaporeans. Nevertheless, he assured me that there were enough leeway to keep someone like me around. I’m not sure how much of that policy helped middle-class Singaporeans; research institutes live and die on public funding and my institute was on a dry spell of funding cuts (30-50% cuts in a 4 years period). However, I realized that the policy hurt the poorest the quickest and they reap the least benefit. Let me explain: the family had a three bedrooms flat, which is by no means poor by most cities' standards; they rented out 2 and the three of them piled up in the Master bedroom, which had bunk beds and such. Also think for a moment the kind of privacy a married couple need and how hard that will be since children are always home. This family was by no mean a rarity. Let me list a few other family situations in HDB rooms I rented:

- Young, recently married, and childless couple in spanking 3 bedrooms new apartment. The husband was a Singapore Air Force mechanic (Iron Rice Bowl kind of job) and  the wife worked as unpaid, volunteer (probably) residential “advisor” of some sort in NTU. Rented out all 3 rooms and they live in a makeshift, cordoned off section in the rather spacious living room built out of glass panes and curtains. The occupants of the bedrooms: a student couple, me, and a contract researchers couple (for one of the Bio Contract Research company) from the Philippines.

- Indian family of 4: working husband, housewife, overboard university student son (found his diary in my room), and secondary school daughter in 3 bedrooms apartment. Again, all piled up in one bedroom and rented out the other 2. Renters are myself and a Chinese foreign student couple.

The problem of middle-class foreigners like me leaving Singapore is in the short run, the income of those families are cut by 30-50%. The two rooms were rented out to me and another foreign software engineer. I stayed there for 2 years, after one year, the other guy left and the room was not rented out to the day I left a year later. Possibly was due to the decreased flow of foreign workers. That room was ~300-400/month.

All the families I rented from all have decent flats, but they are married couples with children who had to sacrifice their privacy and marriage life to have the same income as I did (or a bit less); feeding a family of 3-4 and paying off the mortgage. The ""extra"" middle-class type job left opened by someone like me, does not help them at all; it's unlikely that any of them are qualified for such job. Statistically speaking, the girl from that family is unlikely to get into the same University that I did (though the standards may slide in the next few years). The deposit that was scammed off me represented about 4% extra monthly rent for my stay there. Thinking about it now, them getting a few hundreds extra bucks did not get them any richer, nor did our relative financial standings change significantly.

239,"Four stories about inequalities. I'll have to break it into ~3 posts since it's too long.

Story 1: I was a foreign student getting my Bachelor in NUS. Prior to entering NUS, basically I was getting the best education from the best schools in my country. The point is not to brag but looking back when I am in my 30s I realised a few “privileges” I had. Despite the top schools I went to, the tuition fee my family had to pay was extremely small (by any measure, relative or absolute). My high school was for free since it was a pet/experimental project of the National University (think the equivalence of NUS High School). I did not realised it back then but the families of my classmates are among the people who need the least education subsidies; yet they are getting the highest share of the government education funding. The thinking is logical, and I suspect many will share this line of logic: “why do we throw good money after bad and fund schools with bad students?”. Meritocracy is the word. I benefitted immensely from such system, but I still consider myself a fanatical socialist when it comes to social welfare despite my age (the cliche goes that you become conservative as you grow older).

Story 2: this is something that happened shortly before I left Singapore. I was in Singapore for 9 years and left for Australia for my PhD. I went to Jurong West MRT station and there a middle-aged Chinese/Malay (I can’t tell the difference) gentleman asked me to top up his EZ-link card. He told me that he was on his way to his new job. A vegetable packer, if my memory serves me right. He was showing me a piece of paper of some governmental work program (forgot the name). He was, in short, out of money for a bus/train ride to work. I asked him whether he was Singaporean; he was frantically trying to say yes and offer to show me his ID. I regretted asking him that question; I thought he believed me to be a Singaporean being cynical about him while I was only trying to understand his story. I handwaved it, saying it was not necessary, shrugged and topped up 10 dollars for him. He thanked me furiously. Why I tell this story? Because story number 4 will be a nice contrast.

The animal token that once brought a smile to your face,

I search well deep into the depth of my soul,

Guys, be thankful to what you have in your life. Not everyone has that. I am single, came from another country to develop myself among the best community in Asia.

Having no 'real' friends here yet, I try to enjoy their company to the most. Trust me, they are not even friends according to my definition (every person always got some work, and I am always the one who manages the work to come for their proposed meet). I cannot blame them or tell them that they aren't my good friends, the fact is they are really bad at managing their time. Maybe I am habituated with what I had earlier, my friends from my homeland made me so much dependent on these connections that I still miss them.

I see these beautiful girls here, I feel like having an emotional relationship, and sharing my bed and thoughts with a girl. But as I do not have that (couldn't find THE ONE here, or maybe they didn't me), I try to engage myself traveling to new places most times or trying new things. Obviously, you cannot get everything, I can see that girls aren't interested in me (it's the beard - I have a great European beard which I am not shaving for a girl here). I would love to know some hiking spots here in Singapore.

I love NUS, it has provided me with the best resources in the country: talk about U-Town! You can possibly get the best lifestyle possible here. Gym, Sports, Food, Cafes, Greenery, best residences, everything under some hundred meters. 

Obviously, everyone has negative experiences, even I do -- nobody's living without problems -- it's a sinusoidal wave. But why tell those to people here on a social group who don't even know you and your emotional situation or condition. Instead, talk to your close ones regarding the same. These social groups aren't going to help you. Fking be thankful for what you have! Be happy and be high on euphoria dude. It's that time to develop into something better. This definitely ain't coming back.

244,"Reading #53672 on a cool rainswept evening brought back bittersweet memories from a distant past. Many years ago, I too was young and, like many of the youths here, filled with these dilemmas of ""does she like me back"", ""should I ask her"", ""will we work out"", etc. I met this girl at college and we clicked so well and had such similar interests and outlook in life, that our friends always teased us and thought that we were a couple or about to be a couple. We went for meals and movies together, hung out, texted etc but ... I never asked her the question as I was unsure if she liked me back in that way. In a way, I also didn't feel sexually attracted to her and saw her (back then) as more of a sister, although I knew even then that rationally we would have made a great couple as we shared so many similarities in terms of perspectives, temperament, religion, family background etc. 

Life took its course: college ended, we went separate ways at university, and we began to drift apart, though we still kept in touch, visited each other at our halls, and met up during the vacations. We both graduated and got professional jobs. We stayed in touch and met up for dinners on weekends, and even then I hesitated to ask as I was unsure whether she saw me as more than a friend. I also wondered if she would settle for me (despite our similarities, her family situation is slightly better off) and I told myself that I doubted my readiness to commit. Obviously she never asked either.

Seasons passed and one day she told me that she was getting married. Well, I wasn't really surprised of course as she was eligible, and there was no reason to suppose she wouldn't move on in life at some point. I wished her well, although I did not think I wanted to attend the wedding and so I made up an excuse. We did schedule one last meet-up before that, in the presence of her fiance. I was very glad to see at least that he seems a fine young man who will give her the sort of life and happiness that I, a struggling graduate student, would probably not be able to provide. Unlike you, I never got to ask her the question whether she ever felt for me and whether we ever could have worked out if I had asked back then, when we were close. I felt it would have been awkward, and pretty selfish, to ask for the sake of my own closure when she was already engaged, so I simply wished the happy couple well, and I never contacted her again ever since. Also, unlike you, I never found another, and so today the loves of my life are only my immediate family, my work (which I do love a lot), my former students, and the campus cats.

The purpose of writing this is to tell those of you out there, especially the guys, not to overthink and not to hesitate too much in the prime of life. It is easy to make up excuses for not asking and for not taking the friendship a step further, but remember that inaction has consequences too, many of them irreversible. If you want a partner/spouse, you have to go for it, you have to risk some things. Looking at many of the earlier posts expressing doubts and uncertainty on this page I just want to say, from the perspective of one who's been through that phase and unfortunately missed the boat, that:

Young ones shouldn't be afraid 
To live, love 
While the flame is strong 
'Cos we may not be the young ones

245,"To all the confused souls who have a crush on someone but are unsure if you should confess or not, i'd like to share an experience i had with you.

Many, many years ago, there was this girl i liked (quite a lot tbh) who i used to text alot with. It was enough to make all our friends start teasing us and it was obvious to everyone that there was something going on between us. However, behind the scenes, I was really unsure what was really going on. Were we just normal friends texting or was it more? I was super awkward so i have never once asked her out, and when people asked i just denied. So did she. While texting i did send her some hint-ish msgs but her replies did not really show any clear signs.

Days turned into months, and months turned into years. We slowly drifted apart, especially since we went on different paths of life. One day, i decided to not start a convo (usually i start convos, but sometimes she does too - which made it super confusing), but she did not text first. I was really hoping she would, but the text never came. I decided that it was a sign that we were not meant to be and moved on (it might sound easy but it was really, really hard to let go).

Many years later, (somehow or rather) I asked her and she told me that she did indeed have feelings for me. I found out that she was worried about the same things as me - if either of us were wrong, we might become really awkward around each other and the thing was we were in the same clique of friends. So neither of us took the risk and now... it's all just regrets. I have no idea if she was truthful saying that she had feelings for me too or not (she might be just trying not to break my heart since the past is the past), but honestly, i'd prefer her to have said she did not, which i could appease myself by saying that thank god i didnt make any move. I was a wreck for the next (idk how long), and it was all just a sour mess in my heart. Even till now, even though i'm happily attached to my current gf, there is still a tinge of sourness whenever i think about it. But life goes on, and regrets follow you till the end. 

Tbh, I have still not made peace with myself not going for it. I've tried convincing myself with all sorts of reasons (she's too good for me(which is true and also why i hesitated so much), we were not compatible, she deserves better, etc), but it wont work. The opportunity to even give it a try is long gone now. I know i'm happily attached and i shouldn't feel this way but it's just the what ifs that remind me constantly that i screwed up.

Again, life goes on, and this is gonna be a regret i have to live with. My heart goes out whole-heartedly to my gf, but i believe that there will always be a special place in my heart left for her. I feel like a piece of shit but it's true.

TLDR; if you are still reading this, thank you for your support, it was really hard writing it. If you have skipped all the way here, hi. Lesson learnt - if you are unsure, just go and find out. Most of the times, it just takes a moment of yolo to pop the question- Wanna go out with me for dinner? Will you consider going on a date with me? Even 'What do you see me as?' or 'What are we?'. Once the question is asked, let nature take its course and there's no turning back. What's the worse that can happen? Rejection? Awkward with each other? Awkward with friends? I'd choose those over my regret any other day.

247,"Have anyone saw any contradiction in university? Well here is my experienced I have encountered and I would like to share it here. 

- Lecturers who say this is not tested but end up tested. 
- Asking a fundamental question and was later answer ""not sure just use it.""
- Being forced to take general elective modules as an encouragement to know widely when I am already consuming educational videos/articles such as animals, culture, economy, economic cycles in different areas, politics, etc per day which eats up more time than even my major. (being motivated to learn is better than being forced to learn)
- Asked to focus on the concept not results and during quizzes/exams marked down due to result.
- Asking us to do whatever method that is comfortable but time factor in the exam is a hinder. 
- Going into AI era yet forcing us to consume with knowledge when we are supposed to consume wisdom.
- Giving SGD 10k to create something by the end of school-life while throwing a huge amount of modules which gives little time for creativity to grow. 

Most of the time, I wonder whether I took to right step entering university when there are so many contradictions right at the doorstep as well as the hallway. So many people encourage me to enter and do well but my motivation is FLAT just like a non-rechargeable battery due to such friction I had. Now I most certainly will not enter into my industry which I am pursuing. The politics in school have given me a feel to real politics in the workplace. It has given me a new found drive of not being under anyone after I graduate. I have enough of it. I will still carry on doing my degree as a sign of respect to my fellow acquaintances and friends as well as my parents but you can forget about grades. University has too much politics to show the true measurement of what mankind can really do. I will take the long way to secure my financial support before going into the next stage of my plan.

However, going through the whole process this year, I felt that there are alot of things that the overall committee involved in IFG that can work upon.

Firstly, I do not think it is wise to use the ""backdoor"" approach to get people into committee, as you end up forming cliques and make others in your committee feel left out beyond the superficial fact of just being in a committee. What happen to openess and inclusivity?

Next, why is it necessary for Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson to be in every chat that exist anyway? Isnt the hierarchical structure already there to ensure work is done efficiently? Why must we allocate Sports Club MC to be the PD of different cells anyway? Capability to match up the role cannot be purely by who is in MC and who is not what!

Lastly, why is the structure of comm so segregated, almost like there is little interaction among the different comm. I mean we are one committee, would it not be necessary to know each other more to work better together? We all joined IFG for a reason, why the separation anyway?

Sports Club, while I respect your dedication and hard work, please make some good changes and work on all these problems or a lot of others will suffer unnecessarily for it

I believe that RVRC may have rooms for improvement, and i am really glad that changes are made to make our voices heard. If there is one thing i want to highlight that makes RVRC special, it will be the leadership- that makes it have so much potential to develop.

Every year that passes by, I lose a little more of my sanity. There comes a point where you realise the sliver of hope you were grasping onto was the problem all along, digging deeper down the path of self-destruction. I've been trying so hard to change the path I was headed towards, trying so hard to make things better, to be a better person. It doesn't work. It's not fast enough. By the time I might be better, if I ever could, it would already be too late. I can't help people, I can't save anyone, and I leave everyone I know worse off than before. I have to do what must be done while I still can. It's better to stop now and cut losses than to wait till everything has completely fallen apart.

For those of you reading this, even if things may get bad or stressful, fight for what you can be, because you can. Because you are strong, and you can do whatever you set your mind to do. You are better.

We have been aroused from our slumber by a challenger team in the NUSSU (no affiliation to NUSSUCCB) elections, specifically their manifesto where they mentioned ""the huge growth in NUS undergraduate tuition fees across the past decade from 2007 to 2016"". We decided to do some digging and data crunching on our part on the growth in tuition fees for the various courses since AY07/08. We also did a comparison with the Consumer Price Index (depicted in the bright red line near the bottom).

Our conclusion - growth in net undergraduate tuition fees payable (after deducting MOE Tuition Grant) has generally outstripped inflation as represented by CPI. Perhaps the challenger team may be onto something after all...

I know we're not together anymore, and I know you wanted space and time for us to get through this. But I apologise; I need to write this and send it away in deep virtual cyberspace, for myself to heal. 

We had the best time together, and I don't regret loving you and being with you. Although the time we had were short, we had a great run. I enjoyed every moment I was with you, and basking in your stories and rants made me adore your strength, kindness, and love. The love you gave me too was pure and blissful, and I could never yearn for more. The way you stared into my eyes, the way you hold me, how you kissed me; they were always addictive. The more I spent my time with you, the more I see how beautiful you are. And the more I feel that we were right for each other.

But I was blind. I was blind to the gravity of your trepidation about us, especially with our differing levels of affection and faith.  I will always regret that Tuesday night; the night when you realise you were certain that you don't have as much faith in us as me. If I could turn back time and change that, I would. I had wished that with a little hope and faith, we could persevere through together.

Nonetheless, I still hold on to faith; the faith in us, the faith that we will work this out together. I will always be here holding on and hoping for you to come back with that hope, faith, and optimism for us again. This might go against all rationality, but when have our relationship been built on that? ;) We're too different from others to be that pragmatic. That's what made me fall for you in the first place anyway. 

And don't you be afraid to hurt me again. Because you might not; and even if you did, we can say at the end that we tried our best, and we tried it twice. And that's worth trying again.

I will always be here for you, Sayang. I will always care and cherish you as a person, regardless of our state of relationship. Because I know you'd do the same for me. You always have a place in and a piece of my heart.

Loving and missing you always,

When I was sec 2, 1997 babies were in sec 1; when I was sec 4, 1998 babies were in sec 2. When I was in sec/JC, 2000s babies were primary school and kindergarten kids. And that's the impression I always have for people born 1997 and after. 

Now I'm always surprised to find out that 2000-born kids are taking A'level or even serving NS. Some bright 2000/2001-born foreign kids who got scholarships are studying uni here already. 2003-born kids are already in puberty and having relationships/sex. 

A few months ago I wanted to go back to my old JC then I realized that the JC1 and JC2 are 2000 and 2001 babies. If you are a 1999 baby you are likely an old retainee.

294,"Insularity and Irrelevance: A Brief History of the NUSSU Election System – Part 3 of 3

The 2015 NUSSU election was the first election in many years (or even a decade or two) to feature a challenger team where the incumbent team was in real danger of losing. One problem with having to run through faculty or non-faculty clubs is that a team has to find candidates from various different faculties to run through the various clubs. Even though non-faculty clubs offered “at-large boroughs” where almost any student can run, there were only 8 such seats. Assembling a challenger team across faculties was difficult and usually only an incumbent-assisted effort can be successful. 2015 was different.

The 2015 challenger team was headed by a charismatic candidate, who was also a two-term president of a major student society (a non-NUSSU student group). He managed to find and persuade students to challenge candidates in almost every club that the incumbent team’s candidates were running. For the first time in many years, almost all the external elections for Exco reps were contested. The incumbent team was in palpable danger.

Sensing danger, the first salvo was fired by NUSPA (remember them?). The MC put up a post on their social media platform stating that they do not endorse the Exco rep candidates from the challenger team running through NUSPA. To make matters worse, they went on to criticise the candidates as lazy and incompetent. This was done before even nominations had started, and the candidates (who were siblings) were so incensed that they wanted to launch a defamation suit against NUSPA (and by extension, NUS). The administration was alarmed and the then-Dean of Students had to step in. Eventually, the candidates did not launch the defamation suit because… how much damages can students pay anyway? At most they will just be bankrupted.

The second salvo was fired by the outgoing NUSSU president, who was also the returning officer (i.e. head) of the election committee. First, he wanted to invalidate the nomination forms of the challenger team’s candidates, citing that the clubs’ MCs did not endorse them. This was vetoed by the challenger team’s allies on the election committee, who vowed to resign if he went ahead with improper invalidation.

Second, after initially deciding on online voting, he changed to physical voting at YIH. The ostensible reason was that only “well-informed” students should vote and they should not mind taking the trouble to travel to YIH (a rather-inconvenient location on campus) to vote. The real reason, however, was that he had an inkling that if online voting had been conducted, the challenger team would have won because they had strong backing in at least 2 of the residential colleges.

Election day came and went. Even though the challenger team put up a valiant effort to get voters to come to YIH, ultimately they were undone by the incumbent team who pulled all their friends from the various NUSSU committees (whose offices are also at YIH) to vote. Only 3 of the challenger team’s candidates got onto the Council. Suffice to say, the challenger team’s leader never got the NUSSU presidency.

Alarmed by how “dangerous” it was during the external elections, the incumbent team, which by now formed the 37th Exco, made a Faustian pact with the clubs. In return for giving discretionary powers back to the clubs for filtering out Exco rep candidates at the nomination stage, they wanted to ensure that, at the very least, there is some form of wink-and-nod arrangement with the clubs’ MCs that they won’t veto their intended successors. This Faustian pact was enshrined by a rule change that required at least the proposer or the seconder to be a member of the respective outgoing MCs. The door opened by the 34th Exco was thus slammed and bolted shut.

After the rule change, the 2016 and 2017 NUSSU elections progressed with no problems, at least from the incumbents’ point of view. Of course, we know that many issues have occurred since then, not least the orientation fiasco in 2016. Perhaps there is some karmic mechanism at work out there, because if the challenger team had won in the 2015 NUSSU elections, it would have been the challenger team having to handle the orientation fiasco fallout, not the incumbent team. Alas, the incumbents’ smoother election journey did not prevent them from having a rough time towards the tail end of their term. 

Looking back, the current irrelevant state of NUSSU has really been down to its insular election system. By granting huge discretionary powers to incumbents, they pretty much decide, before the election, on their successors. Students’ votes matter very little, if at all. The Exco reps candidates thus have little to no incentive to be responsive to students’ concerns. Also, in excluding challengers, they have deprived themselves a source of fresh ideas and approaches which, over a period of time, could have halted the slide into irrelevancy. Almost all the dramatis personae have graduated, but the problems still persist.

Additionally, NUSSU’s increasing focus on event organisation over advocacy is another factor in its slide to irrelevancy. Organising events require money and resources. Rising costs meant that NUSSU is increasingly dependent on sponsorship income and grants from the university administration. Whoever pays the piper calls the tune. If NUSSU were to advocate strongly on issues, they run the risk of offending the administration and therefore not have sufficient resources to run their events. However, by not representing the students’ concerns, the distance between them and the students grew larger, thus making their events even less appealing and relevant. This is a vicious cycle that is self-perpetuating. 

The irrelevancy and insularity have become so bad that whenever the administration asks whether NUSSU is confident that they have the mandate of the students, no NUSSU Exco will be able to answer in the affirmative. In any case, half of the Exco is probably co-opted into the Exco by the incumbents without having to run through elections.

I am not sure how the 2018 NUSSU elections will pan out. Honestly, there is much to lose and nothing in it for the challenger team. However, if they still feel that sense of altruism and wanting to change things for the better, they should be given a chance to make it a contest of ideas, not a contest of who can gain more blessings from the incumbents.

295,"Insularity and Irrelevance: A Brief History of the NUSSU Election System – Part 2 of 3

From 1975 to 2012, if a student wants to run for NUSSU Exco, he/she has to run through one of the faculty or non-faculty clubs. At 2 stages of the election process, the clubs’ MCs wield enormous discretionary powers. 

First, the clubs have their own peculiar set of internal rules to filter out “non-desirable” candidates at the nomination stage for the (step 1) external elections. Second, at the first Council meeting where the exact positions of the Exco are determined (stage 2 – internal elections), the MC reps on the Council will then get to vote again, regardless of the Exco rep’s mandate among the students at the external elections. This gave the clubs’ MCs huge discretionary powers in determining who gets the Exco positions, and often incoming Exco candidates look to their Exco predecessors to help link up with the clubs’ MCs and “smoothen” the path to election.

In 2013, that changed. The Exco drafted a comprehensive set of elections regulations governing the Exco as well as the clubs’ own elections. There were 3 major changes. First, clubs were no longer allowed to set any peculiar requirements for Exco rep candidates. All someone needs to run as an Exco rep is to get a proposer and seconder from among that faculty or non-faculty clubs’ ordinary members. No more need for “blessings” by the respective clubs’ MC.

Second, the clubs’ MC powers in their own elections were circumscribed. Where they used to have 100% discretionary power in kicking out “non-desirable” candidates, be it at the interview, boot camp, or just plain refusal to advance the candidacy, the ordinary students of the clubs were to have full say (at least in the first draft of the rules). Predictably, the clubs kicked up a huge ruckus during the Council meeting and things were at an impasse. The 34th Exco, wanting to secure the passage of the rules for the Exco elections, came to a compromise – the outgoing MCs may exercise Special Voting Rights on candidates in their own elections, but subject to a cap of 50% weightage of the final results. It was not pretty, but the 34th Exco felt that they wanted the bigger prize – freeing the Exco rep candidates from the clutches of the clubs’ MCs.

As if to prove that clubs’ MCs successors cannot survive without incumbent advantage, Special Voting Rights were utilised by a club in that very same year – the Political Association (NUSPA). The outgoing NUSPA MC knew that their favoured team was on the verge of being defeated by a “coup” fronted by a challenger team from the then-new Tembusu College. Out of desperation, the General Meeting for the elections was cancelled, much to the dismay of the busloads of supporters that the challenger team had brought there. The outgoing MC then granted itself Special Voting Rights and the result of the follow-up election was never in doubt. You can still search for a report on this saga on Kent Ridge Common. It will not be the last time NUSPA would be involved in election-related issues.

Going back to the change in election rules, the third and final change was that the 34th Exco’s definition of the membership criteria for the non-faculty clubs. Unlike the faculty clubs whose membership is quite defined (i.e. students of that faculty), the non-faculty clubs had always defined their members to be their “active” members. The implication is that those running for Exco reps as well as voting for Exco reps can only be from a list of such “active” members, and such list can be easily modified according to the MCs’ own discretion.

The 34th Exco changed the membership criteria to include all NUSSU members (i.e. all NUS full-time undergraduate students). The reason is that since all the non-faculty clubs split a portion of the $8 from all NUSSU members’ annual $24 subscription fee, they take money from all students. As clubs are only allowed to take subscription fees from their own members, therefore all students who pay them (i.e. all students) are their members. Unsurprisingly, the non-faculty clubs protested, but the 34th Exco refused to budge. They finally relented when the 34th Exco said they could restrict to “active” members, provided that the split of the $8 among the non-faculty clubs will be changed according to their respective “active” membership sizes. None of the non-faculty clubs wanted to change from their comfortable fiscal position, so the 34th Exco got their way.

The essence of these 3 changes is that, for the first time since 1975, NUSSU got the closest to having Exco reps where all students could have a say on whether that Exco rep could get elected in the first place. Unsurprisingly, in the 2013 NUSSU elections that followed, most of the candidates who were running for the top Exco positions ran through non-faculty clubs. The ostensible reason was to at least allow as many students to have a say on the candidacies as possible.

However, 38 years under an election system that encourages insularity took their toll. NUSSU of 2013 was no longer that of the 1970s or 1980s. Also, where NUSSU of the 1980s and 1990s was pretty much the only student body capable of organising major events in NUS, the turn of the millennium saw many independent student groups organising events that are equally, if not more, well-received compared to NUSSU’s own events. The faculty and non-faculty clubs have also grown more independent and larger in scale such that they have taken over the vast majority of the roles played by USSU/NUSSU prior to the turn of the millennium.

If the 34th Exco’s vision of trying to encourage open and competitive Exco elections was the high watermark, the 2015 NUSSU elections made the 37th Exco slam and bolt the door shut.

Insularity and Irrelevance: A Brief History of the NUSSU Election System – Part 1 of 3

*The information presented here was compiled through researching historical documents, reading NUSSU internal documents and talking to some of the dramatis personae involved. The recent change to the NUSSU constitution, which I understand the general students weren’t informed about, is not addressed here.*

The central dilemma NUSSU faces is whether to be a body that advocates students’ rights and issues (since it is often the go-to student group for the admin) or to be a body that organises events for students (e.g. Rag and Flag, parties etc). The reality is probably a mixture of both. However, how the balance is struck determines the direction that NUSSU adopts, and that balance can be heavily influenced by how NUSSU choses its people – the election system.

This has to start from the period 1973-1975. Back then, the University of Singapore (NUS’ predecessor) had a students’ union called USSU. Unlike NUSSU, USSU was not part of the University. It was independent and had control over its own finances. Unsurprisingly, it was quite vocal because its finances were not affected by the ferocity of its feedback to the University. USSU was not only an events organiser but also played an active advocacy role for the students (and, as it will be hinted later, sometimes beyond students).

USSU’s election system was simple. There were no faculty or non-faculty clubs. The students voted on who to sit on the USSU Council and the USSU Council will choose the USSU President among themselves. Although the students did not directly choose the President, they had a say on the candidates running for the USSU Council without being excluded along faculty lines.

Alas, this situation changed dramatically in 1975. After what some would euphemistically call “labour-related incidents” (you may Google “Tah Wah Piow” if you wish to find out more), the Government stepped in. Parliament passed the University of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1975. The Act abolished USSU’s independent form and control of finances. It was made a part of the University and finances couldn’t be touched without the University’s approval. 

More critically, the University changed the USSU constitution and election system entirely. The University created faculty and non-faculty clubs with individual management committees (MCs). USSU’s Exco members had to run for the Council directly from the student body of such clubs. The Council would then comprise the Exco representatives (Exco reps) and some representatives from the clubs’ MCs (MC reps). The Council will select the USSU President and other top Exco positions from among themselves.

The implication of this change to the election system was huge. The USSU President can now run through a small faculty without a majority of the students being able to vote for him/her. Unlike the pre-1975 system where all students at least had a vote on ALL the candidates’ (including the presidential candidate) ability to sit on the Council, the post-1975 system meant that any presidential candidate can just ensure that his/her faculty or non-faculty club likes him/her (e.g. Computing Club), then just garner enough votes on the second stage among the Council members to get the presidency. 

As such, there is no longer an incentive for a presidential candidate to listen to students from all faculties. All he/she needs is to ensure that he/she gets enough MC reps’ support. Due to this byzantine election system, presidential and Exco candidates started to put more weight on their predecessors’ and MCs’ concerns because they play a huge role in getting them elected, not the general students. NUSSU’s responsiveness to the general students’ concerns thus dropped.

This two-stage election system persisted, with minor tweaks, in USSU and its successor NUSSU for almost 38 years. In 2013, the system had another tweak, but that tweak altered the election dynamics significantly.

306,"I miss you. If you'd asked me a month ago whether I would find myself here crying over you, I would've laughed it off. But here I am tonight, wishing that things would be the same. You're not gone, but things are really just a fragment of what they used to be. It's strange to have this depth of feelings over a friend, but that's the way I've always been, I invest too much and end up hurting too much. Maybe I thought that I was special, we had that connection I haven't had in such a long time, I thought that maybe I finally found the friend that would be with me through it all. I guess everyone likes to feel special, so maybe I just tricked myself into thinking that I was. Now I've realised that it was only special to me and not to you, watching you showed me that it's just you, it's something you can do with anyone. You just have that special ability to get close to someone so easily, it wasn't anything special about me that made you open up to me, it was probably just the drinks. It hurts to see a friend slowly replace you, but then again it's not like we've known each other that long, it's barely been 2 months. Why do I never learn, such friendships always crash and burn after a while, we get too close too fast and soon enough we can't keep up with things and people move on with life. You always said that people have their reasons, and friends don't need to talk every day anyway. I miss things so much, but it's so easy to tell that your interest is gone, and I don't want to ruin things by holding on to something that's already fading away. I always thought that all I wanted was to see you happy and see you get better, but maybe I was selfish and I wanted to be the one to help you get better. I wanted to feel needed and special. Seeing other people do it makes me wonder what went wrong and why I wasn't good enough to cheer you up. I really tried my best, I gave 200%, I thought that I wasn't expecting anything but I guess now that i think about it maybe I was. I was hoping that you would be able to be there for me too, I was hoping you would stay. I liked that you appreciated me, I liked that you seemed to need me around. But someone like you already has so many friends, so I wonder what made me think that I would be any different from them. I fooled myself into thinking that I had a special place, and now I'm suffering for it. It hurts, and I'm realising how immature I am through all of this, I promised things like ""it's okay I won't expect anything"" and ""I just really want to see you happy"", but maybe it was only if I saw myself still part of that happiness. I really hate myself for feeling this way, you were the first one I opened up to in a very long time, and I think I just poured my heart out into this friendship without worrying about the fallout. You told me there would be rainbows, and there were, but I realised all rainbows are temporary anyway, they only last a while after the rain. Thank you for being with me through that storm, and thank you for your rainbow that lasted a while, it was full of colour and something that I hadn't seen in a long time. I'll always remember it, you saved me when I didn't even see the need to save myself. I'll miss you for a long time but take care my friend, I still hope for the best for you, and I hope you'll be able to smile brightly once again.

After my A levels, I was hell-bent on going the UK to study. Initially, I set my eyes on PhilosophyPoliticsEconomics which is like the key or gateway to a political career (almost all UK politicans graduated with a PPE degree). Then I had a change of mind during NS to ditch politics since it is such a dirty affair and pursue Physics and Philosophy. It must have been due to reading too much on Einstein, Nietzsche and Spinoza which forced upon me a particular existential perspective that I simply could not refuse.

Fast forward a few years now I'm doing engineering and econs in NUS. You can say it is a downgrade in the degree of rigour as compared to physics and philosophy. I am not at where I once wanted to be, I was not able to achieve my 'dream'. But I am really glad I ended up in NUS and the school's been treating me well so far. I'm really thankful to the friends I have and I feel I am not losing out on the quality of education compared to any russell group universities (I'm only salty because of the duration of DDP). plus there are so many amazing people in NUS too!

Maybe NUS/NTU is the burial ground for people who failed to get a scholarship to go overseas, but going overseas to study is not as important to me as getting a good education. Playing with the cards you are dealt with is more important than being bitter and asking for a wash (unless you've got less than 4 points and you're playing bridge).

316,"My wife and I met at some multi-day event in NUS. More specifically, we started talking to each other on the last day of the event.

Recently, we were reminiscing about how we met when she asked, “How come I didn’t see you around for the first few days despite us being on sister organising committees?” I replied that I was busy running around coordinating the event and handling logistics.

The truth, however, was that I was making out with my then-fling in some far-flung part of the school during those disappearances (got my friends to cover my duties). Fortunately, that fling ended before I started dating my wife, and that was the last fling before I decided to be a guai boy.

317,"Hello guys, today I wanna share with you my love story. Basically I met my bf 4 years ago and we hit it off quite well, he never officially asked me out but we went out 1-2 times a week. After 6 mths I couldnt take it anymore and asked him if we're together, to which he said yes ur my girlfriend. 

But somehow this left a bad scar on me?? Cos when u tell ur friends/parents that ur attached, they'll be like ohh tell me the details, how did he ask, where etc? And I had to lie and say like I cant really remember how he asked me haha. And some will continue on with ""ohh its okay at least he's the one that asked u out :) ""

While we were dating, he hasnt been the most gentlemanly to me either. Like will force me to pay for meals, pretend to be sleepy, tired so that he wont have to send me back, never answers my calls or even gave a call back, will purposely ""gek his hand into a fist"" when I try to hold hands with him??, when I talk to him, wont reply and wont even give me eye contact, usually I have to shake him and be like hello u got hear what I say? Then he will be like uh yeah. And there was even once I caught him using tinder to ask other girls out, but I'm nt sure if he deleted those chats but he said he never went out with them and I believed him. Basically just the worst boyfriend ever. I complained to my friends so much until they dont even wanna listen anymore and all they can just say is like "" Just break up can anot"". I did try, but like everytime I decided that I'm nv gonna reply him again, theres this small ""what if"" that keeps resounding in my head. and I always end up calling him and making up with him again. 

Fast forward 1 year, we still fight alot, but I realised that actually everything I complained about last time he doesnt do it anymore.

Fast forward to now, we seldom fight already because most of the things I'm uncomfortable with I've ironed out with him in the past. 

I once read this analogy on NUSWhispers, it goes like this "" Love is like u want to drink cold water, I have a cup of water and fan it 1000 times but another guy walks past with ice cubes and u go to him immediately. Sometimes u just cant help it, that u dont have what the other party wants"" 

I used to feel that way about my bf too cos I dont really want a relationship where we do our own stuffs, and share what we feel like sharing. I want a closer relationship like shower each other with concern and at least know what each other is doing. But as I keep complaining, or maybe I should call it ""feedbacking"" He slowly starts to understand me more and in a way becomes more sensitive towards me. Basically not everybody can fit you perfectly like a jigsaw puzzle, sometimes u really just gotta talk it out even if it make you seem petty, but if it makes u feel uncomfortable u should say rather than trying to push ur anger onto something else. 

So recently he just proposed to me I'm 26 and hes 29. Its so hard to believe that I'm marrying this asshole guy from 4 yrs ago. Now hes much nicer to me and everytime I tease him abt how bad he was to me last time he'll just be like ""got meh?"" 

So I just wanna advise my juniors who are struggling to have a little bit of faith and keep talking out ur troubles. Dont give up so easily.

318,"To my dearest friends:

I dread the day that our friendship become fragile to the touch of a few insensitive words that occasionally slip out of my mouth. That the attachments we have become weak and non-committal, that we start to find excuses to skip outings because it is more convenient. 


I'm not naive. In my head, I know that people will eventually have to leave you, whether by choice or as a result of life's inevitable and unpredictable events. In fact, i can already feel it happening in gradual,  measured ways as everyone blossoms out of their gawky teenage selves and metamorphosize into the beautiful, mature and purpose-driven adults they are.


Eventually, we all become faded traces in each other's histories, photos from birthday celebrations and wonderful outings become merely reminders of my footsteps and presence in their lives. Pictures of a group hug become a dish served for the taste of nostalgia, but not a drive to reconnect.  


And they'd walk with new partners, possibly better companions, who would leave permanent marks on their lives. 


I really wish my friendships will last till we all become grey-headed, sitting in the familiar circle, as we used to, in the humidity of our old classroom where we giggled at the jokes we make. 


I hope that the pursuit of ambitions and dreams will not erode the purity of our bonds, and that we can remember how it felt like to know that this bunch of people is who we call family. 


That we'd always have each other's back, as we promised in the last line of every birthday card we made for each other.

319,"I first met her in my 2nd year. Being an introvert and in Engineering school, I am naturally shy and have never asked a girl out. I mustered all my courage and asked her out. Somehow I could click with her. She is caring and as an extrovert we made a great couple. 

One thing lead to another, we graduated and one fine day I went to meet her parents. Till that point, I have not been to her house (usually see her off at the MRT station as we take trains after our paktor sessions). That day was the first time I realized she was staying at a landed property. It was massive with a car parked in front. I was proud that my future partner is a humble girl who didn't showed off her wealth. Met her parents and it went smoothly but little I knew that it will all go downhill from there on.

As I was serious about the relationship, I told my parents and got them to meet her parents too. They were happy for me. Then came the series of accusations.

The next day, my gf asked me why my mum ""looked"" angry when meeting her parents? I told her how to ""look"" angry, the conversations went well what and my parents were actually worried I was single till then , why would they be not happy?

On another day, my gf told me her parents are concerned that my elder sister is a divorcee (not actually, she nulled her ROM with her ex-fiancee then due to some misunderstandings but have since remarried and happy in her relationship).

Everyday she picked on something to complain. The sweet and caring girl I got to know has turned to a serial nagger. At every opportunity she will talk down my family. We were going to apply for BTO at that time but she suddenly didn't want to proceed and wants me to stay at her mom's house as it will be more convenient. 

I am working as a programmer and is usually dressed in jogger pants/jeans, t-shirts and sneakers. When I wait for her outside her workplace, her colleagues would pass comments on my dressing to her before driving out while we walk towards the MRT station. Everything became a issue for her. I became not good enough for her :(

Then I realized, it is not her but her parents who are manipulating her.

My parents are blue collar workers who work hard to bring us up. I am proud of who they are and what they do. But apparently these people looks down on them just because my parents do not live in landed and drives a car. 

But my gf parents was very nice to me. So I realized they want me but do not want my parents just because they are not atas enough for them.

I didn't even need to think for a decision. I quarreled with my gf and ""said either you choose your parents or me. We are both graduates and can form our own family and do not need your parents to like or dislike my parents.""

The very next day, my gf's mum called me over. Up till that point she was nice to me, that day she shouted at me. Scolded me for quarreling with her daughter and even talked bad about my family chiding them for not bring up me well and said she is doing me a favor by approving this relationship.

That day I have made up my mind, my gf then is now my ex-gf. Middle finger to her family.

I attended neighborhood schools and had friends from all races and I was happy in life. Then I went to NS and it was also a happy phase in my life. I went to Uni and saw lots of so called high SES people there. I encountered foreign students who upon first meeting me wanted to know what is my family background is to then decide whether to be friends with me or not. Same with many girls i came across.My ex gf is an exception. One nice girl who have born into the wrong family. 

I don't understand people's obsession with wealth and power. Whether you have rolex or casio, the time is the same. Whether you travel by Mercedes or BMW (Bus, MRT, Walk) your destination doesn't change. Whether you have iPhone X or Nokia, the people who call you remains the same. What a human needs to fulfill in life is need and GREED.

Hope our society can change for the better. Had enough of my interactions with the high strata of people. I am happy now working and interacting with real people and not wannabe people who are bloodsuckers in disguise.

Godspeed!!

322,"In the hype/trend/multiple posts about the 'outfit' and 'what you wear to class' issue, let me voice my own few cents. I don't usually do this but I am writing this now cos this changed my life. greatly.

I am your normal girl. Looks department would rank me barely a 3/10. I have decent features (thanks mum and dad), but just a normal nose, single eyelid and small mouth. That sort of thing. And it bothered me for quite a while. All classes have those very pretty and beautiful girls and I was always nowhere near them. I was just plain and simple.

So imagine the shock when someone told me that I was attractive to him. I told him about girl A's straight hair, and he said he was the type that prefers curly/messy hair. I told him about other's eye, he said he likes girls with glasses. I pointed out the dresses and high heels, and he argued and said that t-shirts and slippers are more 'casual', and he likes casual. I would later clarify that he didn't have any feelings for me. So all that talk wasn't some bs to pacify me. 

All I am trying to say is that, different people like different things. That alone should be simple to understand, but we usually forget it. That person taught me the difference between what is beautiful, and what is attractive, something which I would never forget. I never felt so flattered that someone found simple things so attractive. 

The guy I mentioned, he won't even have the chance to read this. And I probably won't find a suitable timing or occasion for this to pop up in a conversation with him. But if this gets to him, I just want him to know that: he is a really sweet guy that is nice to girls that he isn't even interested in romantically. And just because of that, he made me feel confident of myself. Whenever I do feel insecure, if it creeps up to me bit by bit, the words in his letter to me from graduation helps me get back on my feet. I think it's a nice message to send to others out there too. Because no matter how small an action it, it can create a ripple effect. Something small can have big effects. Be it good or bad (something else he told me).

I hope he never changes. And the world needs more people like him. Thank you, number 14 (his favourite jersey number and what we call him from time to time)

326,"We are year 2 engineering students. NUS sends about 2000 students on exchange every year to about 300 partner universities however that wasn't the case for us. This semester when the applications were open for round 2, none of us received the email to apply for it, neither was the information on the student exchange website nor was it on the external study application for us. On the school's exchange website, it is stated that the application dates are from mid of February to end of March; but the application was sent on the 4th of February and it ends on the 18th of February. 

2 students found out from the EE office about the dates but only 10 days after the deadline ended (28th of Feb). After raising it up to the office and making noise, the deputy head of the EE department intervened and made sure we received the email; as we did on the 7th of March with the deadline till the 21st of March. The number of vacancies was tremendously low, seeing how everyone who applied in round 1 has taken up the slots. With all the time wasted, we are sure that this meant that interviews have already been conducted and students already selected from the first email. 

We were given interviews on the 4th of April, well over the selection period. Today, 26th of April, we received an email from the department stating that we are all rejected and the school is unable to offer us a placement of our choice and to try to apply for round 3 instead.
Now, this is quite an issue, as we feel that we have not been done justice. Firstly, we did not get the original email meant for the exchange. Secondly, we were given 'pity' interviews which made no contributions to our case for exchange. 

NUS brags about how students can go on exchange and such yet this still happens. You may say that we are being salty about this. But we just feel injustice and hope that this won't happen to anyone else. 

Most of us are direct polytechnic students, meaning our only opportunity to head to exchange is either in year 3 sem 1 or sem 2. Now we have none, thank you NUS, for this wonderful ""NUS experience"".

As I graduate with my 3.6 CAP, one would assume that my shitty grades means that I've got an amazing social life.  Well, I have made absolutely no friends in nus. I have joined various CCAs, stayed in hall, been in many committees, worked on group projects and met a lot of people. After the commitment is over, the people I met become yet another bunch of strangers nothing but contacts in a whatsapp group, dead and never to be heard from again. 

When I joined I expected uni to be like what I saw in American films with people running around naked and doing drugs. Reality was harsh. I spent most of my time depressed, lonely, masturbating and watching youtube videos hours and hours on end.

Maybe it's me who is the problem. Maybe it's the system. Now, the only thing that matters is that I am done with my life and now approaching adulthood, prepared to be stuck in a money making machine till I die.

328,"Its 2:58 am now and I can't stop crying and can't sleep. My friends should be all asleep right now. Old memories keep flashing in my head.  My close friends knows I cry alot. And on my worst I cry every day for a sem. I don't think I have depression because other than constantly crying when I'm alone, I am not suicidal, have a normal appetite and love hanging out with friends and exercise moderately. I started crying alot since my horrible relationship ended up with him cheating on me and blaming me because I was weird (according to him). And that was a few years ago already. But I think I should stop thinking about this *speechless* guy who often blames me for alot of things even during the relationship. Whatever.

I also can't help to rmb a long long time ago when I made my first guy friend (before I knew my ex). We were sitting in an empty lab at late night doing project and I told him I feel that amongst people in I know in school I feel that he is actually the closest to me and that we have alot in common. I actually have some feeling for him then. His reply back then was he feel that it is *nothing* and its very common to have ppl be common or smth (with a serious face and distracted by other things). I took that as a rejection so since then I often told him he is my best friend irregardless what kind of friend he sees me as. The strangest thing is he avoids me because of what I said. Like we can be in the same clique but he always choose to sit furthest from me. In outings he will choose to absent himself if I went. When I asked him questions face to face he will redirect me to another guy friend and he only would reply me through a common friend on text. The only time he actually unignores me was when I was having my phobia acting up. Once he happened to saw me and he immediately left his other friends to cater to me. He also tried to help me overcome my phobia once. My other friends suggested he might have liked me but when we were in a clique he often commented about another girl whom I knew too as his crush so I dont think he actually likes me. Now he doesnt even reply to my messages anymore. The strangest thing that have always puzzled me. Haha after typing all these I feel nice and sleepy again and time to sleep.

Hey, i am worried about that as well as a simple typo can make an error of 10x. 

However, i do feel that if the mistake was made it is actually our fault. There are multiple chances built into the app for us to detect and correct the error.

That being said, i would like to highlight an incident mentioned by my friend. He actually paid more than required at Sci Canteen Uncle Wong's stall, but the uncle kindly returned the excess via cash. I believe that there may be many of such cases happening in our canteens or even in Singapore and many vendors would be glad to return the excess amount if we are polite and let them know that we accidentally paid more than necessary. 

So let us just be more careful when paying and believe that vendors would be nice as well. Cheers!

341,"Some reflections:

A girl rejected me some time ago. She was my friend. We were in the same classes. We had the same clique. We were closer to each other than to the rest. She seemed interested. I wasn't strongly attracted but I thought we were worth a shot. She said she was attached. Naturally that hurt (and was a little surprising). I tried not to let it show. I wanted to avoid her for a while but stay friends. A little later I asked if she was alright if we chose different classes. She agreed. I thought that was reasonable.

I chose my classes first. She chose the same ones.I didn't want to change. Neither did she. We had a fight. Neither of us changed at deadline. I thought she chose all the same classes on purpose. I was sore and feeling entitled. I thought all I did was ask her to choose different classes. I didn't realise I was forcing her to plan and commit to a schedule months in advance just for my sake.

The next day she cut me off. It hurt more than the rejection. I tried to reach out to her the first few days. Then pride took over and I wanted nothing to do with her. She was a bitch. End of story. I put her out of my head. I met with friends, met new girls. I studied, worked, had fun. The rest of the break was good. Our old friends stayed with me. Later I rescheduled some classes with them. I didn't reschedule because I realised I was an idiot. I rescheduled because I couldn't stand the idea of seeing her.

Later I saw more clearly what I did, for more clearly what reasons. (Nothing special caused that. Just time passing). Asking to choose classes was akin to forcing a commitment. Even if it wasn't, I should have known that's how she would've read it. I had no reason to expect her to swap classes to suit me. I should have dealt and swapped myself. I made bad decisions because I got emotionally charged and worse I didn't recognise it. I should've waited and calmed down more before I next spoke to her and decided what to do. Last, probably as a general rule, I really shouldn't shit where I eat.

I want to say the story ends well. Maybe we started talking again. Maybe I apologised. Nothing like that happened. We don't talk. We don't see each other. I don't see that changing for now. I've decided I'll stay open anyway. Most of this mess was my fault. She was my friend first. I miss her.

(For the record she did a lot more wrong things than l say she did here. That doesn't matter. You get more done taking more responsibility and making more changes than you get playing blame games.)

The other day during lunch, my colleagues and I were talking about our uni days, most of us were from NUS FASS (but we were from different batches and we haven’t met then). My colleagues talked about their regrets, and what they wished they had done during their uni days.

Looking back, I think I had an awesome uni experience. I did almost everything, I went for freshman camps (Arts camp and Union camp), I even signed up as camp counsellor in my senior year. I stayed in hostels, I went for language immersion, I went for exchange, I travelled. I studied a major that I truly enjoyed, I did modules that interest me. I did modules like Forensic Science which was very interesting, I did Singapore Film and made a short film of my own. I did a module (which I can’t remember the title) that had field trips, including overseas field trips to Malacca and Kuching.

I joined 2 ECAs as regular-attending member, joined the exco for one of them in my senior year. I served my student body community, I performed in the UCC. I blogged, and made friends with other bloggers, and joined a blogging community. I went for suppers with my friends, went drinking, went out and had fun.

It has been almost 2 years since you left me after the end of our 1st year in NUS. now that we're both in Year 3, you have moved on but you're probably surprised that I have been single since we broke things off. Even after 2 years, I'm making self-discoveries every now and then as I look back upon our relationship ever so often. My recent discovery made me realise how toxic I was as a person as I now first-hand experience someone toxic. If you do see this, here goes...

Dear ex,
you'll always have a special place in my heart. Always. Even 22 months on. I still talk about you as if you are still a part of my life. im in a situation now where I'm faced w a toxic person and it made me realise what a gem you were and how toxic I was to you. And I'm Glad you left me, no doubt about it. I'm not saying this because I want to seem like the ""bigger person"". But I realise now how wise you were and how much you loved yourself as a person to leave me although it was tough.

Now I need the kind of self-love that you had. I need to learn from you. I'm still learning from you 22 months on even though we haven't really interacted since then. 22 months on and your love and selflessness stays on with me.

Even after saying all these, I don't really wish to get back with you because I knew that back then we weren't meant to be. I believe you were sent to me to teach me a lesson, and I hope you learnt a thing or two as well.
I'm still apologetic towards you for whatever I have done to have made you feel neglected. I don't think we're ever ready enough to meet each other and hold a conversation. But I do wish you all the best in your current/future relationships. I want to see you happy, I say this from the bottom of my heart. Know that your love didn't go to waste because you made me a better person. I'm no longer as spoilt as I used to be and I am more considerate to the people around me :) I'm definitely more rabak too but I hope one day I'll find a reason to settle down, and I hope whoever he is will be as good, if not better, than you. Because you showed me what it means to be treated with love and respect.

Yours truly,
Your once-habibi/darling

You must be a great lover or else people around you will not have assumed that you must be in a relationship. 22 is a pretty young age. Wait for the right guy before 'diving' into the water. Meanwhile consider the criteria that you are looking for in the guy that you want to be in love with in the long term. This includes character, values, goals in life, religious affiliation etc. Not easy isnt it. Dont lose heart though. Time is at your side. Just that finding an ideal one indeed is not an easy task.

352,"Hey, 

 
I'm choosing this method of getting in touch with you because i believe there is no simply no other way to do so.
 

First, let me first apologize to you. I know that no amount of apologies i say would be enough to make you feel even the slightest bit better. However, i still must say. I am sorry for i did what i did, in Canada, in Japan and back in Singapore. 
 

So, what did i do? 
 

While the things i have told you previously are true, i did in fact hide certain facts from you. At this point of time, even though it is too late, i would like to own up to my own mistakes. 
 

I cheated on you while in Canada. I did what i know i should not have done with another man, away from you, and still claimed that i love you. It is also a fact that I slept with Nicholas. It was a conscious choice on my own. I did it because i thought i could contain it purely to my exchange, and i convinced myself that no one could see it, no one would find out and that everything would be the same when i came back to Singapore. 
 

I was immensely flattered that beyond you, i was still attractive to another man. Initially, i simply loved the attention he gave me. He was a good person who would always lend a helping hand to others and would go the extra mile just because he cares. Nicholas encouraged me to be loud and crazy. He wanted me to be. We feed off each other's energy. I always felt so safe and reliant on him. Slowly, i fell in love with his attention to details and how he was able to read me like a book. He showered me with concern and was always very straightforward with his compliments, his need of my attention and his love. 

 
Here comes the hard part: Nicholas and you are completely different individuals with extremely different personalities. I loved you for your quietness, your cool exterior and how you always looked like you knew what you were doing. You showed your concern for me in little ways that catches me by surprise at times. That being said, it was still true that it was always a struggle over your lack of initiative which many a times, ended up being the main reason of our fights. I was loud, and a little too loud for you at times as well which made me feel embarrassed and I feared of judgement. As you said, it might have progressed for the better over the years but having met Nicholas made me reconsidered if such compromise was what i really wanted. 

 
Before I knew it, it was too late. I fell in love with him and his drama. I left for Japan thinking that this was all just an exchange fling. I left for Japan, and I left for you. I thought I could come back to you and I thought I would and that there was no other way. If it was only so easy to lie to myself. We kept going back to each other, no matter how hard we tried.


And at last, I made the decision to leave you. It was motivated by two reason. Firstly, I couldn’t bear looking at you in the eye. I know I have done you wrong. Secondly, I was in love with another man. I cannot look at you the same anymore. This decision was independent of whether or not I had Nicholas in the future, which is true because even when I knew that he was going to try and salvage things with his girlfriend, I did not come back to you. When I left, I told you clearly that I had already fallen for someone else and that I could not compromise any further. These were not lies. What I did wrong was not acknowledging that I had cheated and that I had done wrong. By hiding these, I only sought to protect you. I did not want you to know bad a woman you have kept by your side and how she done you wrong.


The purpose of my email is to admit to my mistakes and to give you the closure that I owed you. I hope that, if you still have any questions, doubts or anything that you would want me to do or know, I am still able to meet you face to face, drop you a call or anything that you request. This would be valid till 18thFeb, and from that day onwards, I will have considered myself having explained sufficiently to you and I will move on, never to discuss this issue again.


This email, and the information pertaining to it, is up to your discretion. If you feel the need to share with your friends, then go ahead; if you want to share with our friends, go ahead. I no longer have a right.

Lastly, please know that, in that 4 years of relationship, I put in my efforts and poured in real feelings. My love for you was real. Please take care of yourself.

353,"My mother grew up in a family that clearly privileges the males in the household disproportionately more. It doesn't help that she only has one male sibling. 

The only male heir was the centre of the entire family. He was the youngest, because they tried several times in hope that they would conceive a son.

She is the eldest sister. And being the eldest in the 60s-70s meant that she had to shoulder a huge portion of the domestic chores, caring for younger siblings, etc. She was her mother's best helper, the one who knew all along the silent hardships and untold sufferings that my grandma kept to herself. 

But my mother, despite all her contributions to the family, was not well-appreciated. 

She never got to eat the drumstick during special occasions. She never got the extra dollars to get new clothes for the year. What extra resources was available in her poor household went to the golden boy. The one who had the right biological composition and genitalia to become the symbol of hope and progress for the family. 

She grew hard under the abuse and indignities of favouritism. She knew that it was unfair her and her sisters were doing so much but her brother remained the only one who was praised for tiny steps. 

She even had to fight to pursue her education in diploma. She got it on scholarship, much to the resistance of her parents. 

Even though the diploma education was sponsored, it was not free because it took up two years, and time is money because she could have been working to provide for her brother's education. I am glad she insisted on the diploma for herself. At least she could break out of where she came from and to Singapore. She was most successful amongst her siblings to break out of the poverty trap.

And, when my grandma suffered a stroke, she depleted all her CPF savings (10 years of slogging her guts out) to pay the high cost of hospital treatment and nursing home fees as a PR. 

Fast forward, my mother, now a 50 years old woman is now living a relatively adequate life. Not rich, not even close. But just enough to live without fearing  insufficiency.

Both her children are in university. Intergenerational mobility seems to be looking promising for her. But as her daughter, I see and experience it - the continuity of the ""son privilege"" tradition.

I cannot believe my mother would continue to practise a habit that she suffered so much for. My mother loves my brother very much. It has reached a point she doesn't bother to cover up the bias. I used to beg my father to persuade her to love me a little more but that was ten years ago. 

How does she not understand the importance of treating and loving your children equally? Does she want me to go through the exact same troubles she had when younger? 

When you play favourites with the children, you divide the family inevitably. You estrange your child from yourself and the siblings from each other. In a nuclear family with average one two children, can two siblings afford to be on bad terms? Who will they rely on as they become older? 

Why wouldn't she think of it? This is the part that infuriates me the most - not even the actual favouritism. But the very fact that you have first-hand experience of being the neglected child and yet you CHOSE to let it happen again. 

I love my mother, but maybe because I feel obligated to. I love my mother in a way that is never consistent. How can I be consistent? I get food, shelter, warmth and free home Wi-Fi. 

But I don't have love.  

Oh. And she doesn't keep in much contact with her brother ever since.

354,"All this saga about who foots the bill. 

I had a few suitors but I fell deeply and helplessly for my man (in case some dudes think that I am below average, I am clearly not). As a girl, I insisted on footing most of the bills, as I was on a scholarship and was also teaching a few tutees. I felt that my bf then shouldn’t be using his parents’ money to pay for our dates. He still insisted to pay for important dates e.g. Vday dinner using his savings (he was in his 4th year, not in scholarship and not teaching tuition).

Fast forward, we are now married for the 7th year with an ever curious daughter. He foots almost all the meal bills as the husband when he becomes financially stable, I foot the bill as and when I feel happy to treat le hub. We both contribute to support our small family. 

So not only guys can pay the bill, and I am nothing near a feminazi, I support and respect my hub as the head of our house. just felt that it is only right to fend for ourselves as a couple back then.

356,"For fellow commuters of the NUS shuttle bus:

To those who refuse to move in and take a seat on the NUS shuttle buses, please stop doing it. There is nothing at the back to be afraid of. Should be put dollar notes there for incentive? 
 
Watching the illogical emptiness at the back of the bus while gripped with desperation to get up the bus is immensely frustrating. 

Everyone (98%) is going to get down at Utown, KR mrt or some other common nexus point in school with high flows of human traffic. So don't worry. You will get off the bus. Even if you are at the back of it. Trust me.

To those waiting to board the bus, stop crowding the entrance. Surely we don't need an entire research to prove that blocking the entrance of the bus where people alight will cause only greater inefficiency. 

Don't ""tsk"" if someone steps on your foot as a consequence of where you are standing. You are more likely to be stepped by standing there. Sounds harsh, but it is true. 

To those who like to talk and chat WHILE boarding and alighting, please hold your conversations until you are in the bus space or outside. We all want to get up and get out quickly. Nobody wants to hear about your one night stand or whether you are hungry. We can't leave if you keep turning your head round to continue your talking while shuffling 0% out of the bus.

To those who swing wildly while clutching onto the dangling handlebars, your bag smashing into my abdomen and ribcage hurts. Please try to gain some stability and balance. I know its fun to swing around but it hurts me.

Let's make our trips around school a more pleasant journey!

357,"This happened when I was 13.

I had a huge crush on this cute girl who had just joined my Mathematics tuition. She coincidentally lived in the same residence as I did, only two blocks away. We eventually started talking more, and became good friends.

Few weeks passed. Winter came and in my city, it’s during this time of the year when people pick up badminton as a casual outdoor activity. Our residence had a common multi-purpose sports court for everyone, and almost every evening, I would find myself playing there with my friends.

One particular evening, I was surprised to find her at the court, along with some of her friends, as she usually did not come to play. In fact, this was one of those few occasions when I saw her outside our tuition classes. Now, at that time, I was a very timid and self-conscious person. And she was kind of my first crush. And this time, we were meeting outside the constraints of a classroom without any textbooks and notebooks or any kind of academic talk between us. And she was in the company of other girls. Conclusion: I was too shy to talk to her, let alone ask her to play badminton with me, although I so wanted her to. :O

She stayed around for sometime, played with her friends and some others, and eventually started on her way back. I had stayed put in a corner and stared at her playing half the time (the other half, I tried focusing on playing with my other friends), trying to hide all signs of nervousness. She looked at me with a confused expression, and then left. My mum called me for dinner a little later, and I left too.

At the dinner table, I could hardly eat a morsel, kept thinking that I should have asked her to play. What if she never comes to play again? Will I find another way to talk to her outside classes again? Mum noticed I was hardly eating, and appeared surprised as she had cooked my favourite meal.

A little later, I heard a familiar sound from the sports court outside (my block was the closest one to the court and I could see/hear everything from my home). I went to the balcony and there she was, back at the court! It turns out that her younger brother was still playing and she had come back because of him. Thank you, little one!

I hadn’t finished my meal yet, but I just had to go back and ask her to play before she leaves again. What happened next shocked my mother like anything (and me a little later, because I couldn’t believe I did this). I rushed back to the dinner table, found there were still 3 chapatis and 2 veggies to finish up, and I literally gulped it all down my throat in less than 1 minute. Mum stood at the threshold of the kitchen, open-mouthed. Then I yelled, “I am going to play!”, grabbed my badminton racquet and rushed out the door.

Yes, I asked her to play. And yes, we played a good game. Finally. She won. And I went back home and puked.

My question is what is the best thing to do with this old laptop? It is structurally still ok (never been dropped, no breakages), so should I attempt to donate it, resell it on Carousell for a nominal sum to someone who could still get value out of it, or drop it into the e-waste recycling bin at NUS? I've removed the hard disk so there's no risk of data breach etc.

Anyone with any advice?

Thanks!

True pain isn’t an intense inferno that gets extinguished by a torrent of tears.

It’s the fiery flickers that somehow linger, and nimbly evade all efforts to wipe them from memory. 

They return as they wish, searing the heart, not so harshly to summon the teardrop firefighters, but they singe sufficiently to peel open the wound, never allowing the burn to fully recover.

And that harrowing idea of not being able to truly move on is the pinnacle of pain, sending the fragile heart into swirls of despair. 

I have always seen Jenny (not her real name) in school every now and then, but I didn’t pay much attention to her. Undoubtedly she looks beautiful, but I don’t fall for girls I don’t talk to. 

One fine day my stint as a teaching assistant ended, and my professor asked if I could recommend a replacement. Just as I walked out of the room, I bumped into Jenny. I conveniently asked her if she wanted the job, and since it was near dinner time, she asked me to share details and experiences about the job over a meal outside.

We had an enjoyable dinner session and had flowing conversations. As we left the restaurant, she found the view of the Read bridge (at Clarke quay) and it’s surrounding buildings enthralling and wanted me to take a photo of her.

Since my phone supposedly had a better camera, I took the photo and sent it to her via WhatsApp (and that’s how I got her number LOL)

Over time I talked to her more often, to the point where it was almost daily, either in real life or online communication. I found her really fun to talk to and to my pleasant surprise, we appear to share similar values and opinions because I always felt I was an oddball. I could tell her all sort of bizarre opinions of how society should function and almost all the time she would be in broad agreement. And she’ll tell me of how her peers sometimes criticise her for her choices and I could see no fault in her. The best part is: I wasn’t even blinded by love/infatuation because I didn’t even have romantic feelings towards her then. It was only after my friends shipped us together then I started noticing that she’s really attractive (not just the physical sense, believe it or not, I sometimes forget how she looks like)[somehow after I got to know her I bump into her in school less often] The seed of romantic thought was planted in my head, and slowly metamorphosed into intense infatuation (I still prefer to call it love)

In the next few weeks I tried to drop hints that I liked her and asked her friends to find out if she feels the same way. Unfortunately the report was discouraging (in terms of romance) because all she said “he is very good friend”. Regrettably, my rational mind had left me so I downplayed the response and exaggerated the “clues” she seemed to drop that there is a possibility of a relationship. (Handy tip: it might be a good idea to ask disinterested parties for their opinion on certain messages, sometimes in exhilaration good friends may also be influenced and mistakenly view innocent messages as “mega hints”)

As time went by I was thinking of the optimal time to confess. Some of my friends suggested confessing soon because “wait too long and you’ll be even more fearful of confessing because you wouldn’t wanna destroy the friendship, hence trapping yourself further in the friendzone “ while others were saying “it’s too soon, it’s only a few months since you actually interacted with her”. I personally wanted to wait longer but I soon changed my mind (partly cos the friends suggesting I confess sooner were “louder” about it, but of course I was convinced so I went ahead with it, I don’t blame them at all)

So on that fateful day I asked to meet her some iconic place in school. (no details or else she’ll know who I am) Depsite being armed with a bouquet of roses, my heart was shivering like a soldier facing a tank. And sure enough, my heart was blown to pieces by her devastating “No”

Thankfully, she handled this well and it wasn’t awkward. We continued being friends and still chat once in a while, not so often however, especially since we don’t really take many same classes. (Or is that just my excuse to avoid the pain, I’m not too sure)

Initially after a few days, I no longer felt sorrow and I naively thought I have successfully got over it. (I always thought I was half a robot) 

But whenever I see her social media posts I feel a slight jab of pain and when I see couples together laughing to one another, I feel another poke. And when people who I didn’t tell about my feelings ship me with her, I force a smile while fighting back tears and say “nah we aren’t meant for each other”

These stabs don’t pierce deep, but they come every now and then, and I realise I cannot truly wash away this cinder of agony. But it’s alright, I would do it again because the marvellous memories we had together are worth so much more

Jenny has a boyfriend now. I’m happy for her and hope she won’t need to message me after midnight asking me for advice and pouring out her sorrows. I’m sure she doesn’t need to, she seems so happy now. 

As the clock reaches midnight, I check my phone, smiling gently as I see no request for help. I turned off the lights and drifted to sleep, hoping I’m one step closer to getting over her

368,"Hello everyone on NUSWhispers, to my juniors and everyone else whom I'd come across during my time in NUS, I hope you're all doing well. 

Seeing my Geography juniors celebrate and commemorate the end of their Honours Thesis journeys was touching and served as a really nice reminder about my university life, and how just one year ago, I made a HT that I was really proud of personally and that served as a real defining marker of my university life. To all of you, my heartfelt congratulations to you and I hope you guys enjoy the last semester - you'll all miss undergraduate life in different and multitude of ways, just like myself right now.

Now one year on, I find myself in a different place, pursuing my Masters in this subject which I find myself loving. I made the decision to move overseas for academic reasons (to pursue a research interest that I felt was better in this overseas university as compared to NUS) and personal ones as well (the feeling that I did not really belong to society in SG, at least for now). But it is the latter reasons that get to me, for in this famous city that I am in now, I do feel quite lonely and rather frustrated at times. My masters' coursework, for all the love I have for it, is decent but unexceptional, which means that the chances for an overseas PhD are pretty slim and almost unrealistic if it continues this way. My social life was deceivingly quiet back in NUS; yet right here 11000km away, I feel like I'm wandering around too much on my own in this cool weather, doing the same things on my own almost every single day. It does feel as if nobody really knew me here, again. 

In short, my life as a postgraduate is such a huge departure from undergraduate life: I miss the noise of that youthful life, the cheerful, emotive and humane faces and struggles that I used to see and share when I was a little younger. It is this kind of youthful and accessible atmosphere that we often fail to cherish, but since many of you have had great clique or group experiences, you all have something that I'll never truly have as an undergraduate: a sense of real togetherness.

And perhaps, being away from SG does make me realise how Singaporean I am; how I still crave for that Singaporean touch and presence. As I type this far away on my own, however, I don't feel as if I can connect to the Singaporean students in my university; no Singaporean I know is doing the programme that I do. People here are almost like the salaried employers back in SG; minding their own business or simply being overly business oriented. Yet here I am, just sauntering around, not knowing what to do, with a thick jacket and a worn-out camera. And yet I feel more Singaporean than ever, no matter where I'll end up living at in this big, big world.

So to my juniors and everyone else whom I know, enjoy this journey while you still can, for all of your futures would diverge in ways you all may not imagine or even conceive of. Some of you would become writers, others becoming doctors, some being aspiring hawkers, plenty being civil servants, teachers, policymakers, in Singapore or otherwise. But wherever you go, you may be just like me: choosing to be far away to seek a new life for some time yet feel as alone as I did before, like a flaneur in a sea of crowds that one cannot associate with. Yet, I implore you to take the unusual steps, of seeking out your own heart like I did, and acting out through your own will in the ways that you can.

To be honest, I am a fortunate person in so many ways, yet so deficient in many others, like how I might have outlined here. And like you, senior here does not even know his future, feeling like he's perennially lost and confused, and trying to turn back the clock and be young again when it's no longer, ever possible. And yes, I am still very afraid of my job prospects, wondering if anyone over here or there would employ me and decide my future. But don't worry, at the end of it all we're all finding our paths in life, in intimacy and love, in friendship and kinship, in academics and corporate or individual pursuits, we're all still finding, learning, loving, and ultimately missing things, wherever we are.

And if you're out there struggling with life or needing someone to talk to, you know that your seniors are here, like myself, to help you all out and figure life out together. There’s always a DM or a chat, if you’ve already known who I am here.

Till then, enjoy the world, for it is a beautiful place, no matter the chaos and despair we inadvertently read of.

And to everyone else, enjoy NUS or the other academic institutions you are in. Student/undergraduate life is a hidden blessing, really.

P.S. It is always fruitful writing about the world, and writing the world :)

We belong to the same group of friends since our JC days. We were not particularly close to each other then even though our group of friends hung out together pretty often. My memories of those times were of me teasing her with another guy who was rumoured to be pursuing her. Her only responses were those of exasperated denials.

We got closer when I entered NS and she entered university. We started talking more and she shared tips on how university academic life is like. From time to time, she would also share her views on her scholarship and how it seemed to both widen and constrict her options. When I was required to bring a partner along for an NS social event, I did not hesitate to ask her. She agreed, much to my elation.

We continued our interactions even after I left NS. When I entered university, she was the ever-helpful senior who passed me seniors’ notes from her friends even though we are in different faculties. Once, she even lent me her textbook for a common module. We agreed that we clicked well because we were both pragmatic souls and that our outlook in life (at that point in time) were similar. That said, we never revealed our interactions to our common group of friends and during outings with that group, we did nothing out of the norm.

During my second and third years, we gradually hung out with each other more often. However, the interactions between us seemed to have an invisible red line, one which both of us are very conscious not to approach, much less step over. Once, I drove all the way to the other side of the island to deliver an apple pie to her house. Another time, we went to the Marina Barrage and sat down back to back, just enjoying the breeze, silence and each others’ presence (and smell) till the wee hours of the morning.

I often struggled with that invisible red line and whether I should take the initiative to try stepping over it. A big concern was our common group of friends - what would happen if things went south? Would it fracture the group? Alas, such concerns were unnecessary. I confessed to her one night at Holland Village that I had feelings for her and whether we could be together. Her reply was that her character was not suitable for me and if we were compatible, we would have gotten together since JC days. The red line has been clearly and visibly marked with a No Trespassing sign erected on it.

Fortunately, that botched confession did not affect our friendship nor did she make it awkward for our occasional group outings. We moved on and got busier with our respective lives. She graduated and started working for her scholarship organisation. I was heavily involved in my CCA during my last year of university and was also busy preparing to enter the workforce. I got attached and so did she. Our group of friends still meet up from time to time.

By the time this is published, I would have attended her wedding and witnessed her walk down the aisle with her husband. In writing one’s life story, there would be co-authors. Some co-authors leave after some time, some will continue writing your story together with you till the end while some will help you write a chapter here and there, but never together with you till the end. She belongs to the last category.

I know what I should feel when I see her in walking down the aisle in her wedding gown with her beau - pure platonic happiness that a friend has found her happiness.

However, in the deep recesses of my heart, I know what I will feel - a tinge of hypothetical what-ifs and a twang of curiosity about how we would have turned out in other parallel universes.

377,"As 2017 is coming to an end, I can't help but to spend some time reflecting upon myself whenever I'm taking my 30 mins drive to and fro work for the past few weeks.

I'd say, I've spent my first half of 2017 happily as a final year student, full of confidence. And the second half (from Aug onwards) as a working adult, full of agony.

At the point when I entered my final semester, I've already became the more lao jiao (old bird) fella who knows the system at NUS and is no longer so concerned and hard up with my grades. 

Even with FYP due before the end of the semester, I still don't feel as stressed as before and somehow I felt that I'm still in control of the situation. I no longer stay back till 2300 every night to study and do tutorials. For most nights, especially after those with evening classes, I even went about having dinner at various places or to play pool with my friends.

I had a brief shot in attempting to bud off a relationship with someone and spent a good 3 months period dating her.

Everything was wonderful to me for the first half of the year until August came. That was when everything became gloomy.

Things didn't work out with that girl and that's also when my ""real"" work starts.

My work is too demanding and the hours are insane. It doesn't help when I was simultaneously trying to nurse myself out of the heartbreak.

I see myself working14 to 16 hours a day. And work related messages just seem to come in every time, even during my off days. 

Nevertheless, 5 months have passed and I felt that I have learnt a great deal of things through this period.

1. Don't fret too much about girls. If there is a good one around whom you think that you like, seize the opportunity and make your move. But if she is not interested in you and is someone you can't be yourself with, just fuck it and move the fuck on. It is pointless to beat the dead horse and expect it to run. It is even more toxic to lose yourself over someone.

2. Work never ends, but the last thing we should do is to complain and whine too much. Just man the fuck up and start establishing control onto the situation. You will be surprised how much you can achieve, as long as you are willing to work.

3. Most of the problems we face are not exactly problem as long as we have the solution or exit strategies for it. 

4. Be really alert and wary over all your colleagues, regardless if they are your superiors, peers or subordinates.

Looking back at how I've transformed over this year, I'd say that this year has indeed be a rather turbulent, yet significant one for me.

To all my juniors who are still in school, don't fret too much about results. I've been seeing lots of crap about S/U and grades. I'd say, all these talks mean nothing once you are at work. 

If you are a first class standards*, good for you. Good luck in excelling at work too.

(*I know NUS has this new High Distinction, Distinction, Merit thing. But let's just be clear that employers still recognise the old system.)

For those who got grades below the second upper standards, don't get dejected. Perhaps you are just a B average student or a B- or C+ average student**. That's nothing to be ashamed of. You will eventually still find something you are good at and will still be able to excel at work, as well as you are willing to put in the efforts for it.

(**I was also caught at the 3.8+ zone before and resided to my fate of being a B average student. But funny as it seems, once I accepted reality, I whined and bitch less, got really focused in doing my best in year 3 and still managed to pull my grades beyond 4.0 by the end of year 3.)

As for all these relationship/ romance talks, I know that it may seem as though like uni is a best chance to find a partner. But let's just be clear that there's more to life than finding a mate. Perhaps it is more important to work on yourself, your career, your current relationships with friends and family, before you start screwing around with romance. It is just not worth it putting so much attention over all these stuff  all.

Good luck and I would like to wish everyone a happy 2018!

380,"#44823 and #44762: I had a similar problem this year after living in UTown for some time. Began to get gastric pain and severe bloating before and after meals, which soon got worse to the point when I had difficulty breathing and dizziness because everything literally felt so full of air down there. It gets worse in the evenings and when I lie down to sleep, and I keep getting this choking feeling in the back of the throat as well. Couldn't sleep at all some nights because it felt like I wasn't getting any air whichever posture I lay in. Been to ER twice because of breathing difficulty in the middle of the night but they found nothing wrong with the ECG, chest x-ray, blood test and oxygen level. The doctors at UHC said it's acid reflux from the stomach, though they don't know what's causing it and they've referred me to the specialist at NUH next month. I've been on Omeprazole 20mg since November and it helps a bit - I understand there isn't any other medicine they can prescribe at this point. 

Just wanted to say that if you have this condition you need to be very careful what and how much you consume - I find that coffee/strong teas, spicy food (curries in particular), artificial food (like instant noodles) and strangely, tomatoes aggravates the problem very badly. Because you would need to take small meals throughout the day to reduce the bloating, keep track of your calorie intake and usage to prevent your weight going through the roof - mine shot up by 5kg in two months and I'm desperately trying to bring it down somehow right now. Plain yoghurt, warm porridge and soup with a small serving of noodles seem good for soothing the stomach without piling on the carbs. 

Last tip is that if you are on Omeprazole and/or antacids like magnesium trisilicate, those are ridiculously expensive in Singapore so if you can drag yourself to a pharmacy in JB you will be surprised at the price difference. It's also available over-the-counter there - just get and keep the product leaflet in case of queries at Customs. 

Hope you all get and stay well soon. No idea what's causing this problem - hopefully the guys at NUH can tell more when I see them next month. Just putting this out there to let you know you're not alone, and hopefully this helps in some way.

386,"I recently met a girl through online gaming and I fell really hard for her. I think she kinda did too. We’ve been playing dota, overwatch, WoW, etc, together for about 4 months now. I asked her for a date and intend to confess my feelings for her. She dodged the subject for a few times and I asked her if it was because she’s attached. She said no, but she thinks I wouldn’t like her in person. I reassured her I wouldn’t because she’s really nice online. 

She’s from NUS too and we agreed to meet after her final paper. But now, I’m so disgusted at myself for being a pig. I finally met her, but she was far from what I expected her to be. My image of her was kinda shattered and I didn’t pay much attention to her during our date. I was in shock or something, I don’t know. She obviously noticed and she ended our date immediately after dinner.

I couldn’t bring myself to go online for a few days. I’m really ashamed of myself. Today, she texted me “I told you that you wouldn’t like me once you see me. I was right. I know I don’t exactly look flattering. I’m sorry.”

Afterwards, I couldn’t find her online. I think she blocked my number and cut off whatever means I had of contacting her. I’ve never felt guilt this way before. Why is she even sorry when I’m the terrible person here? It feels like she must have experienced this a lot. 

To YM, I’m sorry for hurting you like this, I’ve sent so many apologies via whatever means I had. I’m sorry for being a visual animal and didn’t even try to be subtle about it. I liked you and I think I still do. I didn’t know what I was thinking, but I’m just sorry. Gaming with you was a pleasure and I’m trying to reach you not only because I want to make it up to you. But I really want to officially ask you out. This is not guilt controlling me, it’s not pity either. Please give me a chance to apologise and you can decide if you’d allow me to make it up to you.

Since Christmas is so soon, I was thinking back on how much you've given me. The beautiful notes you wrote and photos we took together were the best. However, due to circumstances, we just had to end things. Moving on was not easy for me. I can't imagine how much more you'd suffered.. I hope by now, you've completely gotten over me!

Turns out that's only half true! Singaporean girls are really open and friendly. I had no problems chatting anyone up and made a few intimate friends. But the Singapore men are generally more reserved. Perhaps this is because my faculty has many more female than male, so I did not get a good sample.

393,"Recently I’ve been reading absolutely idiotic confessions about young people (I assume) who are unable to accept that their bf/gf have had sex with others in their past before. Let me share a story that could change your feeble minds. 

S was young, beautiful and tender. I was on a break with my gf then (Think Ross/Rachel). She had a stable bf whom she already was engaged to. Nevertheless I went ahead to charm her off her feet. I succeeded. We were on my bed, doing the deed when her hp received a msg. We stopped because she wanted to see. Her bf had sent her a msg that was so sweet, that they have received their hdb ballot number. And it was a good number too, mind you. They were gonna be the earlybirds who could have the pick of the lot. 

She stopped and stared at her Hp. I slowly reached out to her hp, took a glance at the contents, slowly put the hp away. I went to kiss her, closed her eyes, took away the cap I was wearing and we continued to do it raw. 

“Wtf” must be going on in many of the readers’ minds right now. Indeed. It’s a true story. My point of sharing the story is very simple. THE TRUTH IS ALWAYS BRUTAL. 

No one, not her current bf, now husband and father of their 3 children, would have taken the news in their stride. No man could have endured this take of how their girl has betrayed him and would be ok and retained the relationship. THE TRUTH IS BRUTAL. ALWAYS. 

We didn’t work out in the end, I went off with my gf (which we were on break with). S continued with her bf, whom of course she probably didn’t share this juicy nugget of a jem of a story with. So they ended up in blissful marriage. 

Moral of story: the truth is always brutal. Don’t see it as lying to yr current squeeze. See it as protecting yr current squeeze. Then get imitate with him/her and add 1 more to yr list which you can then be guilty about after you are married. 

Yes I’m an asshole, no I have no STDs, do u even know what the odds are lol!! I’m charming as hell, and if the guys are still gonna reject the ladies because of their past, trust me, there are charming guys like me who doesn’t give 2 roots and then proceed to bed’em anyway. Grow a pair... and use ‘em, young runts.

At that time, I was dating this girl called C, we met in JC1. C was (and is) really special to me, we had amazing chemistry and spent a lot of time together. Well in NS, A excelled (encik/officer liked him, OCS etc) however I wasn't envious about what he had, after all he probably deserved the good treatment he got. I was just grateful I had C. During our ORD meetup with our BMT bunkmates, we had a party where some of us brought our gfs. Of course, I brought C. Turned out to be a big mistake, I found out (much later) that they had exchanged Facebook contacts and had been getting to know each other after that party. Oblivious to what was happening, I continued to go out with C. Things changed rapidly when I joined NUS, where C suddenly became cold towards me. I didn't go for FOCs because I didn't want her to be jealous or worried (my faculty has a high girl %). She did go for FOC for a different faculty, where life decided to be kind to A and C, placing them in the same group where I'm sure they got to know each other better. After her FOC, I met C about four times, with her getting more distant, finally choosing to break up with me via Whatsapp. It's been 3 years and I only learnt a few months back that she broke up with me because A was rich and good-looking [*paraphrased] and she felt like she was being short-changed with me. Despite A's value, I have also heard that A and C's relationship is on the rocks...

Neither has a day gone by that I have not experienced the crushing pain of being apart from you. I acknowledge that I was not the perfect boyfriend that I could have been. I also want you to know that while I am unable to change my appearance beyond a certain extent, I am determined to do my best in life and earn enough to make us both comfortable, prosperous and happy. Wherever you go C, my heart will be with you...always.

Singaporeans are basically gold diggers. All my friends talk about is about money and being rich one day, some of them even like to show of their flashy cars and branded goods as though their self-worth is tied to their wallet or their car, or house... Some people who even behave differently because they think they are wealthy, I know of people who boast of not taking public transport and how much their parents make. Well, as a person who's bank interest probably surpasses some people's net family income, I find this kind of behaviour extremely disgusting. I don't see the problem with taking public transport, or wearing cheap stuff, in fact I do it all the time... 

Moreover I do these kind of things because I see how some of my friends worship money like a God, and always attempt to leach on wealthy people, or want to make friends with them, not knowing that I am of considerable wealth myself. 

I've become really afraid to reveal my ""true"" identity because I don't want to be treated differently. To have friends ask me for drinks etc and treat me ""better"" to gain my favour. I don't want to have gold diggers surround me like flies and I don't want people to view me as a walking money bag. 

Thus far, I've never brought any of my friends to my place because I don't want them to think differently of me. I'm always more guarded about my background, and am generally more introverted because of this. I know other wealthy people in school who also do this, we walk amongst you but hide our true identity because frankly lots of Singaporeans are superficial and materialistic, and we don't wish to be party to this culture and be made used of.

I'm currently a postgraduate who can be described to be studying in an Anglo-American nation, but yet I do miss undergraduate life very much (even though it is Week 12-13 back in SG now and I know finals and more deadlines are coming but that's life right sigh). #40082 is a very very familiar confession, and some of you here who read these confessions know who I am (just saying hahaha).

Anyway, I just want to get this matter out of my head and heart, and I hope you guys would hear me out. There's an angmoh girl in my postgrad course whom I've been feeling kinda weird towards. She's really beautiful, very family-oriented and mild-mannered, though rather shy, quiet, reserved and currently difficult to hang out with as she lives a couple of hours away from the city I'm studying in. We literally take the same masters courses, so I'm the person she arguably spends the most time with during her time in school. This has led to us having a lot of time with each other within the school premises; she's been randomly showing me photos of her family and her trips to Asia, while thinking that I'm doing great in my coursework assignments, she keeps asking me for help on schoolwork. I honestly think I'm just mediocre in class though. Hahahaha sigh.

The thing is, because we never spend much time out of class due to her steadfast commitments in returning home before dark every single day, I don't know how to concretely-feel about her. I;m attracted to her; sometimes I just like to look at her and think about how beautiful she really is as a person, however I'm also not sure on how she's feeling towards me. Dialogues about our families and personal lives seemed to be punctuated with intermittent pockets of silence, yet I feel strangely comfortable in her presence. Our online conversations are often about work and there is some initiative in talking from either side though I'm the more active texter, yet her replies can be very inconsistent and are more on the shorter side. I don't know if she's becoming a really good friend or a potential lover, it's just confusing to me.

Perhaps her current evergreen status (just like mine) might explain her unclear actions, but I have no clue. She's open to me visiting her hometown and would like it if I let her know about it. I'm thinking about that possibility, yet I secretly wish that she would have some initiative on her own part too. Kinda sucks if she keeps going back home without a chance for drinks and hangouts after classes right...

Maybe I'm thinking so much about love because I've never really experienced it; maybe it is because of an everlasting fear that I'll live a life that's on my own for too long a period in time. Maybe it's because I haven't really been able to have many real friends cause people just don't even bother replying my texts or keeping me company; I've been eating and hanging out so many times on my own. Heck, I don't even know where I'll end up in life; having a life companion could help sort my future and direction in that respect. 

I guess I can take comfort in that I have some really nice Christmas light decorations that fill the main shopping street in the city I'm in. 

Perhaps, lights would guide me home, wherever my 'home' may be in this messy, contentious world.

Till then, all the best for those assignments and exams and holla out to me when you're in the same city as I am. I would really love to have more friends, and more company to get me out of my studying compulsions...please say hi!

The conversation was brief and I want to get to know him better, though I did not ask to exchange contact as I thought that would seem a bit eager. However, I'm stuck with what excuses I can use to start a conversation with him the next time  I bump into him without appearing desperate! Advice please? :) PS. I heard from a mutual friend that he is a joker and fun guy around his guy friends but is shy and introverted towards girls.

404,"Bung and I had a special relationship. We met each other during BMT in army and we were the best buddies. We had the same frequency and the same goals – to get through army as painlessly as possible and to avoid wasting cheap breath on army life when we could talk about everything else under the sky. Not that I had any friends to go out with on weekends, but we both knew that there were more beautiful shades of green than the one found on the uniforms that I always told my mother not to squander non-existent pride in ironing. Bung was gay, but not openly so. Within the somewhat toxic dynamics of our platoon, I was the only one, among all our army mates, whom Bung trusted his secret with. I accepted his queerness as I accepted my own fate as a loner in life and the odd one out in the platoon, albeit a rather lucky one. The reason I say so was Bung. Although we needed each other for rather separate reasons, at least one was quite similar: to better understand and overcome our inexperienced but clear-minded state of loneliness. 

Wednesday afternoons at the UTOWN swimming pool was how we stayed in contact after we ORD and entered different faculties in university. It was the time of the week that I looked forward to the most. After all, Bung was my only friend. But that was about to change. 

Bung found himself a boyfriend who studied business like he did. The protected time we both treasured during the only free timetable slot we had in common demanded no further protection from Bung for his heart had been toughened since army, by an inclusive environment towards his gayness in university and with newfound strength came readiness, readiness to forget the warmth that I had always provided while others cast strange gazes upon him, readiness to put love above friendship. And so, I became alone again. 

Bung would have trysts with his lover on Wednesday afternoons at the same pool. Long conversations, friendly lap races, random body contact and suggestive smiles were evidence I gathered. He made no publicity of his relationship but did not hide the weekly rendezvous from me. After all, I would have found out anyway. To avoid creating awkwardness between us, I changed my swimming sessions to Monday evenings. Life went on as usual, but there was no longer anything to look forward to in the week apart from meals with acquaintances that would often lapse into awkward silence, especially around me, and CCA sessions that just got more boring with each passing week. Still, they were better than nothing. Hall parties, stayovers, clique move outings – those existed only as images that I conjure while fully submerged in the pool, images that disappeared the moment I came out of the water to catch a breath, only to be replaced by the sight of the setting crimson sun, as if a portrait of my descent into oblivion in the midst, ironically, of throngs of vivacious swimmers. 

I found the purity of my solitude reflected in the clearness of the pool. I once thought: if I dropped a blot of ink into the pool, the pool would remain clear as crystal. Yet if I dropped a blob of ink into a small puddle lying beside it, the contamination would be visible even to the myopic eye. I wished that my mind and soul would amalgamate from puddles into a deep pool impervious to the fleeting happiness of others that I could only see but not experience. If I could get by without any oasis of knowledge to seek refuge from in army, other than that which existed in my own mind, I should be happy in the enlightened university environment. Yet time after time, I found myself descending to the floor at the deep end of the pool, where I would close my eyes and pretend to be dead. But my legs wouldn’t let me continue the pretence. It would waggle my body out of depth in a natural act of survival. It soon dawned upon me that once you have mastered the techniques of swimming, you cannot unlearn it. Once you have learned your true nature, you can only struggle to escape it. Once you have learned to survive, you have no choice but to keep up with the pretence of being alive.

407,"Hello, I'm the OP for #43063. Thanks for the words of advice and encouragement. Just to clarify, not sure if the post is intended to serve as a memorial for Jamie. Maybe it is, because they're words that I could have said to her when she was still alive. 

Both the boyfriend (known as YS in the post) and I have no idea that she had cancer. He was only informed about her passing and her suffering from cancer from their mutual friend. And that mutual friend (along with the few mutual friends they both shared) have no idea that she had cancer. Apparently she kept it very limited to only her inner circle. Therefore, it came to us and everyone else as a shock. 

I am still slowly coping and accepting the fact that her death wasn't my fault - we didn't see it coming, and it was inevitable. Though I do still think sometimes, someone as bright and talented as her shouldn't have gone so soon, and someone like me should have been replaced instead. 

There's one commenter who wrote that 'people only care when someone dies' and you know what, that's the ugly truth. Because we take it for granted that everything in the world will work out as what we thought it should be, and when something unexpected happens (such as someone dying), we start to care. And that's a bad thing. 

I know this is a very cliche thing so say, but please don't take things for granted. I learnt it a hard way - because all I could think about now is how things would have been different if I didn't do what I did and let emotions got in the way of my judgement. If I initiated the idea of establishing a friendship with Jamie then I wouldn't be feeling this way. Probably her journey to battle cancer would have been less sufferable with two good friends by her side? Now I can't help but to think that maybe, before she goes, she wanted to fulfil the wish to talk to YS but she couldn't. All because of me. 

Till then, Jamie is still deeply knotted at the back of my head, and slowly but surely, I can stop blaming myself for what happened and move forward with our lives - particularly with my relationship with YS. But for now I just need time.

The guardian seemed embarrassed about the kid's behaviour as his ""nature"" required him to touch our equipment a lot. I hope we as a society can be more welcoming and understanding about such children. I believe, that such children are more than or equal to normal children and deserve respect. This is a confession that I could not do much to make the guardian feel comfortable and that we were perfectly okay with the kid playing with out setup ! We must support children irrespective of how they behave. They are the future ! Though this confession may not necessarily reach the guardian, I wish to urge other members in NUS community to be more understanding and supportive of people who have slightly less money, etc than others.

410,"This is something I need to get off my chest, and it's been bothering me for a few months now. 

Okay, so boyfriend and I have been together for 6 years now. I've known him since primary school, and we only got closer from Year 1 of polytechnic because of mutual friends. So during poly days, he used to chase after this girl (let's call her Jamie) who studied in a different course. All I know about her was she rejected him few times because she liked another guy or something like that. Judging from what I heard of her from him, she's a social butterfly, and she is a very talented vocalist. She totally owned people in karaoke and even took part in singing competitions. 

So we graduated. Boyfriend and I decided to make it official as a couple. I entered the workforce while he waited to enlist in NS. During that time, Jamie asked for his help because she needed to take part in a singing competition and he was a musically inclined person so he's like the right person to go to. I was busy with work for a few weeks during that time so my evenings are spent at work and he spent his time with Jamie at the recording studio few times a week. After the busy period was over, he still helped her out and I was fine with it (no harm helping out a friend right?). The competition was over, then after that I didn't hear anything about her for about few months. 

That one night, he went to shower at my house and I was using the laptop when there's a Whatsapp notification on his phone. I peeked at it, thinking it was one of his many group chats and whatnot, but nope. It's from Jamie, and it read 'Hi! What are you doing?'. Mind you, it's like, going midnight and she was texting him. 

I was confused? I mean, he didn't mention anything to me about her ever since the competition was over, so I assumed there was nothing going on between the both of them. When he came back, I asked why Jamie was texting him at this hour and he just said that she randomly texted people when she's bored (oh okay). 

Then I found out... that he was indeed texting her like, secretly without me knowing for like many months - asking him about his NS life, whether they can catch up for lunch one day and she even go to him for her issues with guys. He mentioned she initiated the chat the whole time which was true (he gave me permission to scroll through his chat) and he was just being a good friend by replying her. There was one instance where, he was out with me on a Saturday and she initiated a text. He replied that he was out with me and she gave a SAD emoji as a reply. 

I don't know, maybe I was just jealous. Could it be things were beginning to rekindle after the many days spent preparing for the competition? Maybe she started to see something in him, and maybe he liked the fact that she was beginning to reciprocate his feelings towards her? At that moment I exploded, I questioned his feelings towards me and her, and if he still feels the same way back in poly days when he chased after her. That maybe, I was just a rebound in order for him to get over her. He denied everything, and he has zero feelings for her and completely moved on. 

I told him that I don't want Jamie to contact him anymore because I don't trust her and her motives. He agreed to it, and he did called her but at her end, she was very unhappy. She tried to convince him to stay as a friend, and she feels most secured with him and shit like that (I ain't buying anything at that moment tbh). He told her straight to the point that he doesn't want anything to do with her anymore. We argued that night, because I was feeling insecure and he treasured every friendship he had, even if includes someone who rejected him. 

So from that night onwards, there was no mention of Jamie. We moved on, we had happy memories together for the next couple of years until something happened. 

He was on an exchange to Europe, and that day we kinda argued on Whatsapp, and honestly I forgot what we were arguing about. Probably because of the time zone issue so we only talked to each other like, for a few minutes each day. Tensions were high, we were typing furiously on the keypad and suddenly he just typed something along the lines of, 

""You don't know Jamie passed away recently? No right?""

I remember I didn't type anything for like a few minutes. The argument suddenly died down to focus on Jamie instead. I asked why, what, how but he only said,

""Why do I need to tell you? You don't care about her''

Long story short, I found out that she passed away due to cancer a few weeks after his exchange started, and he didn't manage to say his goodbyes and attend her funeral. He did visited her after he came back to pay his respects. 

Honestly, up to this day, 6 months after her passing,  I was still affected by it. I remember I couldn't sleep for a night or two because I was bothered by it. He could be feeling guilty because he wasn't there for her as a friend through her toughest moments, and he could be resenting me for it because my insecurities drove their friendship apart.  We didn't talk much about it; he's the type to bottle emotions up and deal with them by himself. Sometimes I want to approach the topic, but I don't want to anger him and opened this highly pressurised and huge bottle of emotions he's been keeping within himself because well, 'I don't care about her' as quoted by him. 

Life went on as usual, we still went on dates and holidays, and recently celebrated our anniversary. I did casually bring up about Jamie's passing, and how he's coping with her departure. He said he moved on from it; he wasn't feeling depressed and sad anymore, but I can't help but to feel otherwise? At the back of my mind, sometimes, I do think about her. Even though maybe, to him (and maybe to you too), I have no right to. 

To Jamie, I don't know you well, and if I would have known you would be gone so soon, I would have taken a chance to get to know you instead of forcefully ending the friendship you and YS shared. It made me realise that I was just a person harboring so much negative thoughts towards you, when you yourself is a person that possesses so much positive energy and strong spirituality - something that probably, maybe, why he fell for you many years ago. Now I keep wondering if things were different if I hadn't did what I did. Maybe you might still be alive and well. I apologise for whatever hurtful feelings I caused towards you and I hope you could forgive me too.

May you rest in peace.

416,"Here's my story

After being single for close to three years, I met my then-boyfriend (Let's call him Ben) in 2012. Like most relationships, the ‘honeymoon period’ was smooth-sailing. But two years into the relationship, he received his enlistment letter.

While our friends broke up with their partners during NS, we were adamant about staying together to overcome this hurdle. It was only a little distance after all, and we’d still get to see each other over the weekends.

But what we didn’t factor in was how our different phases in life would affect our priorities and lifestyles.

I was accepted into a local university when Ben entered the army. While his ‘freedom’ was taken away from him, I was attending crazy university camps and partying every weekend.

Although our lifestyles were different, we made an effort to update each other via text. But with the overwhelming stress and tight schedule in university, our text messages became less frequent.

Ben didn’t cope well with the separation. His camp buddies often fed his paranoia and he even became too clingy because he was fearful of losing me.

As time passed, Ben and I found it difficult to relate to each other. Conversations became shorter and I found myself missing the physical comfort of having a man beside me.

This was when I met his best friend. (Let's call him Leo)

Though Leo was also serving NS, his vocation allowed him to text and meet up more frequently.

Whenever Ben was away or busy, Leo would keep me company. Of course, my boyfriend wasn’t happy, but I told him he was simply “over-thinking” because he couldn’t spend as much time with me.

I rationalised, Leo wouldn’t do anything because of the ‘bro code’, right? I mean, I was just chilling with a good friend Ben personally knew and trusted.

While I wasn’t blind to Leo’s good looks and charms, I often reminded myself of the boundaries I had to keep.

But without realising, the more I depended on Leo for comfort, the more blurry that ‘friendzone’ became.

The affection, attention and reassurance I received from Leo was the feeling I missed; the same emotions I felt at the start of my relationship with Ben.

Eventually, I started developing feelings for Leo, and so did he for me.

Despite our mutual attraction, I brushed our feelings aside because I didn’t want to ruin my two-year relationship with Ben. I was also acutely aware of how wrong it’d be to cheat on my boyfriend with his best friend.

Until one night, Ben and I fought, and our argument pushed me over the edge.

I had just returned from a two-week school trip when Ben got himself in trouble with the authorities. To cope with his disappearance, I turned to Leo.

As I was ranting to Leo while lying on his bed, I felt him inching closer, and I let him kiss me.

With all my pent up emotions, I wondered why I was staying with Ben when there was such a good guy in front of me.

One thing led to another and I ended up sleeping with Leo that night because of the physical intimacy I craved for.

After the deed was done, I felt ‘normal’, as though I knew it was going to happen and I was okay with it. But it didn’t take long before the reality of my consequences sank in.

Leo gave me three options: to tell Ben, break up with him, or keep the secret to ourselves. I chose not to say anything because I wasn’t sure Ben would be able to handle the blow.

To cope with my guilt, I started wishing for Ben to hate me, so I would intentionally stir up fights and try to break up. He asked if Leo was the reason I was behaving this way, but I denied it and blamed it on our unresolvable differences.

I wanted him to hate me for being a bitch, than for being a cheater. We broke up eventually and I stopped talking to Leo.

Three years later, I confessed and apologised to Ben. While I did it to ease my conscience, I also felt he had the right to know the truth. He said he forgave me but deep down, I don’t think I deserved his forgiveness.

While you can’t control feelings, you can control actions. I could have controlled the relationship I had with Leo but I let it slip out of hand and ended up hurting two people at the same time.

It’s selfish to say I had feelings for them both but I was torn between which I valued more; something old and familiar, or new and exciting.

No matter how stupid it sounds, I was in love with two people, which I know was no excuse for my wrongdoing.

I cheated because I liked the attention Leo gave me. He was there for me when Ben was absent.

Even though I often called Ben “needy”, “clingy” or “attention-seeking”, I realised I was no better. While Ben turned to me for support, I simply ignored him and turned to Leo.

If I could turn back time, I would have avoided the situation entirely. I should have worked things out with my ex rather than choosing another guy as an outlet to vent my problems to.

Even though my feelings for Leo were genuine, I wished I ended my relationship with Ben before any of this happened.

If there’s one thing I learned from my mistake, is that there’s a difference between loving someone and loving the attention you’re getting.

422,"Here's my personal story,

Back in those initial carefree days in NUS, I fell in love with a girl.
It's been such a long time since I've met someone who moved me
We chatted for weeks, talked about our problems, 
Our deepest problems, things I've never spoken to anyone about.
I dare say we even crossed many emotional boundaries.
We studied day and night together, had breakfast and dinners together.
My thoughts were with her the entire time
I thought she was the one. 

I even started putting in some thoughts for our future.
When will we eventually apply for BTO?
How long will it take before our combined income exceed the eligibility?
Never had I thought everything was set to go downhill

Everything changed when she met this guy.
She started being disinterested in me.
All replies were short
I was devastated
When I needed her the most, she vanished

I beat myself up,
Cried many sleepless nights,
Couldn't focus on schoolwork for weeks
Finally decided that the only way to move on was to speak to her face to face about the issue

It was a painful experience, I tried my best to be as unemotional as possible when I spoke to her about our relationship/friendship.
She admitted she only saw me as a good friend and that she was dating someone else
We decided to remain as friends.
Yes, it was still extremely painful, but I thought at least it will help me move on.

However, nothing changed.
Her replies were still as disinterested and short.
I've tried to convince myself countless times that she's busy
Sometimes I thought, maybe it is no longer appropriate to talk to her about many things because she is attached.
Other times I thought, maybe she just wants to distance herself so as not to not hurt me.

I'm slowly sinking into this realisation that things will never go back to how it used to be.
Friends come and go.
Invest emotionally into someone who reciprocates and deserves you.
I'm really shocked and disappointed that it has to end this way eventually.
It's an outcome I've never once expected.

So the point of my little tale is - if you're wondering whether to confess or not, angsting about mixed signals and worrying about ruining friendships... Just go for it!

I fell in love with my best friend from JC, but we are both girls. It was really the dream, and even when I looked back at the pictures, I realised I was and could still be very much in love with her. Spent 2 years very closely together, truly explored love with naivety and innocence. We understood and took care of each other, knowing that we could live this out the rest of our lives. 

But just before the A levels, I took my stand that I do not want a same-sex partner, no matter how liberal and accepting society is becoming, with PinkDot and other international movements. 

I suppose it's an internal struggle, when one chooses to repress emotions and attraction, or even the desire to be attentive and loving to another human being, just because one knows that there is so much more one can do so much better than guys who are not doing what one can, all for the sake of ""salvation"". 

It was so hurtful. I stopped all forms of communications with her. It was painful, and it's a past I cannot deny. It hurts and haunts even when I try to enter a straight relationship. Was it all worth it?

I don't have a choice. It is worth it.

I still remember the way that you'd smile when we were together, when I used to hold you like it would never end. We were talking crazy, like forever was here, not a worry in the world with nothing to fear. But now, things are awkward and we're not even friends. I'm so tired. How did we get here?

Can we go back to the day that I see? I'm not ready to call that a memory. There's a tension in the air, and I know you can see. Every second passing is slowly killing me. Every day, I pretend like I'm not losing my mind.

428,"To #41653: 

I can sorta feel #41620's angst, his vehemence about the nice guys issue makes me recall my own rejection experiences in the past. I can somewhat draw parallels to his confusions as to why the rejections still happen.

For my experiences, my feelings for the girls' only came about after getting to know them better and keeping each other company more often - daily school interaction, studying together, chatting online etc. At the start, I didn't even think I would like them. I can say only I started to realise their physical ""chio-ness"" after realising our personalities could gel. Then we get that perfect combi of personality and physical attraction. Although yes I naturally also would want someone pretty, I still look lots at the girl's personality and attitude to even get that spark to have a crush on them. That perfect combi is always what I aspire for.

So I thought their keen interest in actually wanting to interact with me (as so I thought from their spontaneous vibes and their initiative in wanting to know me) and that we shared common experiences and shortcomings, I thought after sometime we could be something. But sadly it didn't.

The first girl whom I eventually confessed to rejected me for another guy. That other guy grew to be someone really attention-seeking, shallow and even has that drip of sarcasm and fakeness in conversations with others. I grew to dislike him because back in earlier years when he was still single - he wasn't even this cocky at all and more humble. I can even regret not being tactful enough to let him step all over me by trying his insincere sarcastic conversations on me. Quite horrible. Even up till this day I still don't understand why she specifically chose this very guy over others - like please there were also other decent guys to choose from if u rejected me.

The second girl - Initially, she would only come to me for academic work purposes but further down the road we eventually could converse about other topics like holidays, tease each other etc so naturally that I thought chemistry built up. Later on I got friendzoned but was still deluded we were something. Eventually when I asked her out it didn't go well. And from then on, it was difficult to maintain relations like in the past. It didn't feel as spontaneous as before

After that, it got complicated, I could somehow only bring myself converse online and not in RL for fear of being awkward in front of her. There was lots of up downs - sometimes we could still chat and help each other even in RL as normal and sometimes we wouldn't talk. Yet I still had false hopes that we could still maintain a friendship at least. However, I just could feel the drifting apart because she was sticking more towards our other classmates and looked happier with them instead. It made me feel disappointed and cheated that I was once again contributing one-sided and that all our past fun/memories didn't mean anything.

TL:DR I got rejected twice. All these experiences have since only left me confused with whether IT WAS JUST ME or THEM? Like the first girl - are these honestly the preferred choices today?? Or for the second girl - why the sudden drift away from me even when I still at least want to make things as natural as possible between us?? It makes me feel that revealing your feelings for someone is a mistake. Then when you look at other people, they have it so easy. They just get together... Though sometimes you feel certain people really dont deserve it given their attitude.

Many people supposedly label me as a unique person and even girls in the initial stages can admit they're wowed by my hobbies/interests. Maybe I was too full of myself. I've come to realise that my supposed uniqueness is something hard to accept for an r/s. Now I can't bring myself to anyhow share this part of me to new peeps I meet unless I can tell from their vibes that they wont mind it.

So honestly I just wonder if this ""nice guys"" nature is playing such a big issue in getting someone to like you. Let's not even talk abt F***boys - but must one be really some guai lan show attitude ASS (regardless big or small extent) to get a girl? I honestly can't fathom such a thought and change myself as such coz ik that wont showcase my true self. At most, I can change to be a more tactful person in my daily interactions but certainly not this. Lol sometimes I do wonder if I should change as part of bitterness and that I have nothing to lose since no one can somehow like me.

For myself, I've been trying to think less about this past I had and focus more on my unique interests. Its not easy really, I just have so much unjust, unfairness and confusion given the logics I have witnessed from all this. It does randomly haunt me at times on my chances in future girls.

430,"We broke up last year. It seems like years ago. 

I still remember our late night talks, the first time we held hands and then the first time we walked back together. I still remember, after we broke up, how I would stalk you on social media just to see your face, my insecurities arising when I see you with female friends. Oh, those good (or rather, bad) ol' days.

You said you really liked me previously, then you also said that you didn't want to continue our relationship anymore due to our differences. I guess sometimes feelings will fade, sometimes people who are not compatible get together with each other and then realise that they are not a suitable couple. Sometimes, 'liking' is not enough.

I guess that that very day, you were right. But sometimes I would still think that you are a coward because I was the one who asked whether we should continue our relationship; I knew your feelings for me already faded but I just wanted to give us a last shot. In the end, I got left in a mess because I got dumped by you, by a failed first relationship. I was asking for it -- to be dumped by you -- since I was the one who initiated about the conversation of ""Should we continue our relationship?""

I thought i wouldn't be able to get over you but eventually I did. 

I am so happy and glad that you dumped me because I am now in a very happy relationship with someone who loves me a lot and showers me with love and care. And I love him a lot too. Something that you didn't give because you said you won't do anything for me. Sometimes I would still think of the happy times we have together, but the bad times are much more prominent. Our relationship was a mistake, yet if I were to choose again, I would go through those post-breakup depressing days again because they shaped me to the stronger person I am today.

I still wish you all the best.

To all girls (and guys): Don't get stuck in a bad relationship. Love yourself, don't plea for someone who doesn't love you to stay. You are better single than in a wrong relationship.

Lecture notes/slides in Uni are often so sparse and readings are often so random. I don't know exactly what to study, unlike in JC where there was so much to read but at least you knew that was all you had to study.

433,"[Long post warning]

Freshman year. My first Union Camp. I was in awe of the rah-rah and noisy atmosphere. My faculty camp was much quieter and tame (perhaps not the alcohol part). It was nice meeting people from different faculties as I come from a smaller one. We exchanged MSN Messenger contacts and added each other on Facebook. I had issues with my SP buddy. Some seniors said I was the problematic freshie. Yet, the OG had a fun time. I felt the $70 camp fee was the best $70 I ever spent. Sadly, I missed pool day because it was my ORD day.

Next year. My second Union Camp. I harboured dreams of joining the o-comm and help recreate the good experiences for the next batch of freshies. Alas, the problematic freshie reputation caught up with me. The o-comm flatly denied my participation in any o-comm role. I was deemed not rah-rah nor responsible enough for house head, so they shoved me into an OGL role. I felt down, but decided to make the best of it. I started out being a stickler for rules. O-comm said no crashers, so I followed. The co-OGL’s girlfriend was a crasher, and she felt I was targeting her. Tempers were frayed, but we maturely trashed matters out in a seniors’ meeting. The freshies did not know about it. Both the freshies and seniors had a great time after we buried our differences, however temporarily. I also met great seniors from other OGs . I realised that perhaps being an OGL was, on hindsight, a blessing. MSN Messenger was now out of vogue and we used Facebook instead. I missed pool day again because of rag duty.

Undergraduate journey halfway done. My third Union Camp. This time round, my choice was unambiguous - OGL. The house head was someone I knew from my NS days. The night before camp started, both of us spent hours spray painting bandanas in one of the halls. The bandanas were all but discarded by freshies within the first day. Two seniors in my OG had a dispute before the camp was 2-hours old. One threatened to leave the camp. It was one of my toughest time as an OGL. Luckily, cooler heads prevailed. Freshies had no idea about the dispute. I was chillax about crashers this time round, and the OG expanded by 50%. We had a great time. We spent the last night HTHT-ing, went back to bed for 15 mins and spent the next day at Sentosa till 10pm. Two cans of Red Bull in quick succession helped. Facebook contacts were exchanged. There were also some who started following each other on this new app called “Instagram”. I missed pool day yet again because of some meeting with the university admin.

Senior year beckoned. My fourth Union Camp. The house heads were people I knew from hall and NUSSU. The seniors in the house were a rather united bunch. It helped that a number of us attended another camp the previous week, so we had some practice of camp ‘skills’ (e.g. cheers, ice-breakers). For the only time, the seniors in my OG were people that I met for the first time. It mattered little. We had a fun time with the freshies. Camp programmes were frankly uninspiring, but with a united bunch of seniors, we created our own filler programmes. Freshies said those were better than the actual camp programmes. I was more chillax than ever, perhaps a first sign of age. We exchanged Facebook and Instagram contacts this time round. Also, I finally attended my first Union Camp pool day. 

Student life was almost over. My fifth and last Union Camp. The o-comm asked if I wanted to be a house head. Nope, OGL was good enough, because as one of my former house heads said, “Being a house head is like being in an OG of two”. The ice between the seniors in my OG was not broken until someone Whatsapp-ed a picture of two cockroaches mating one fine night. She was then known as the “Cockroach Sex” girl. We had a fun time with the freshies. We followed each other on Instagram and added Facebook contacts for uploading photos. Late nights felt more unbearable. My energy levels felt unable to keep up with the freshies’. I spent the night before my commencement HTHT-ing, so it was a struggle keeping my eyelids open during my commencement ceremony. I knocked out for 2 hours at home after commencement. Father Age has finally caught up with me. I wanted to attend beach day, but the Cockroach Sex girl insisted that I attended my girlfriend’s commencement. I am thankful till this day to have listened to such advice. I did not attend pool day yet again, because there was no pool day in the programmes.

Union Camps. They were pretty much the constant in my non-academic university life. They were also, by far, the best parts of my time in NUSSU. They allowed me to meet many people I would not have otherwise met and gain people-handling skills, tackled issues that may not always have the easiest of answers and forced the introvert me to open up. The changes in my Union Camp experiences are, in my opinion, a microcosm of my character change and changes in university social scene over the years. I harboured no illusions that acquaintanceships formed during Union Camps would last. In fact, I am not in contact now with the majority of people I met during the Union Camps. Some asked why I kept going back for Union Camps. Was it to snag a partner? (I pretty much freshie-zoned the freshies and I met my girlfriend outside of Union Camp) My answer is simple. The people I met in Union Camps may not be my lifelong friends, but for the 4 days 3 nights that we spend together, I will try my best to give the freshies and seniors a good experience. As long as a couple of them found Union Camp a good experience for them and/or decided to come back for Union Camp in the following years, those early mornings after late nights, those fatigue, those sunburnt-ness and those time spent were all worth it.

P.S. To all the house heads, seniors and freshies I had met during Union Camps, thank you for being an indelible part of my university life. I hope everyone is doing well.

I'm not scared of being judged by guys, I don't care if guys judge my look, my sense of fashion, my grades, my personality, my background. Usually guys won't care unless you mess up with them. 

I heck care about my image in front of guys, I could just put myself on relax mode. I'm not scared of accidentally making a fool of myself in front of guys. Different story for girls, I have to tense up and make sure I don't appear dumb to them.

436,"I always rate Uber drivers 5-star if possible, and at the very worst 4-star, because I know it affects their job and for some it's their ricebowl.

But today my own rating abruptly plunged from 4.92 to 4.75 and Uber does not allow viewing of individual feedback so how would I know which driver I inadvertently annoyed, or how to be a better rider in the future? Seems pretty meaningless to have an abstract system like this when people may be taking more than one ride in a day.

In my case any of the three I encountered this morning could have been the passive-aggressive guy who wrecked my rating afterwards:

1. Guy who was not happy I asked why he didn't take the (toll-free) expressway to the train station - which is the route every other Uber driver took before this - instead of the congested road with multiple traffic lights.

2. Elderly retiree who kept driving slowly, missing green lights and braking hard, all the while complaining that he doesn't do this for money and is ""just providing a service to ordinary people"".

3. Posh-looking lady who seemed passive-aggressive annoyed I was riding for free on promo code to the nearby train station (""take bus very difficult hor?""). Wanted to drive off without even ending the ride to see if the fare was really $0.

Best part is I actually rated all of these people 5 stars before I noticed my own rating had been given a slamdown. 

Now I wonder if my reduced rating will affect my ability to secure Uber rides and/or promo codes in the future.

We will always think of the previous order, how it was better in the past and ask continuously why something like this could be allowed to happen.

Besides answering her questions such as the name of the JC that I studied at & that I m currently studying in NUS, I pretended that I don't remember her & promptly ignored her.

I must point out that the ""me"" back in JC is very different from the present, which suggests why she is interested in me now: 1) back then I was quite fat but now I am very fit after NS; 2) its very rare for people from my JC to study in NUS Law & I happen to be the exception; & 3) I would say that my dressing has significantly improved since then. - thanks to my bros, especially the girls, who give me great fashion tips. (P.S. My personal tip to anyone based on my experience is that a nice watch, especially a Rolex, helps to subtly/ostentatiously say a lot without doing much, hahaha)

447,"Recently I found out someone who I once care about didnt actually find a job after graduation this year. Ok, my ex-bf (and I'm a girl). I feel surprised and slightly disappointed for him somehow because when we were together he couldnt make time for me because he wanted to study hard to get a good job and earn $$$ himself and live the high life. I'm fine with that back then. He was a very hardworking person so I try to be as supportive as possible.

Even now after we broke up, as a person who still care, I feel kind of disgusted that he doesnt seemed to do anything towards his dreams after graduation. He is currently living like a retired life, travelling and buying things to sell on forum to cover the costs, driving (I dont know how to differentiate cars but it looks like the expensive kind with low seater), eat a lot of $$$ food and book locations to host his favourite sport games to earn a commission from the participants. 

Honestly, my first reaction is to scold profanities because I honestly doubt his lifestyle can even be sustainable in long run, not to say a high life.

The only reason that I think he became like that was maybe he found a easy source of revenue. He left me some time ago for an unmarried old woman (many years older than us both) who can match his lifestyle and is desparate to get married.

Ok, now I feel so much better after venting and should get back to study.

449,"I fell in love with a girl I met on the last day of school.

She was in my grammar class. I had never spoken to her before, but she left an impression on me. She was cute, had a bob of hair, wore bright red flats, asked smart questions, and gave good presentations. An English major myself, I had a small crush.

On the last day of my undergrad, I saw her get on my bus. I was sitting at the back. She sat in the middle. I told myself to go talk to her. I told myself it was the last day of school, and that I had nothing to lose.

The A1 stopped at the library, she got off, and I quickly dashed after her.

“Hi!” I said a bit too loudly.

She stared at me with wide eyes, wondering who I was.

“I’m in your grammar class,” I explained quickly. “I loved your presentation on Singlish.”

Her shock turned to delight, and we began to chat about the course, our degrees, and what we were doing after graduation.

She had to rush off, but I saw her later that day in the class that we had together. We had a snack party because it was our last class, and we continued to chat. We talked about books we loved, our time at NUS, and our passion for the humanities even though many people around us didn’t think it was practical. She was about to move to Japan to teach English. I was staying in Singapore  for grad school.

The class came to an end, we wished each other good luck with life after university, and I told her it was too bad that we didn’t meet earlier. I didn’t make many friends during my undergrad, and it was nice to know that someone existed out there who seemed to see things eye to eye with me. She said the same.

We went off in opposite directions, but a minute later, I stopped in my tracks, ran after her, and called her name. She had a smile on her face. I told her that as English grads we should keep in touch. She said she’d like that, so we exchanged numbers and added each other on Facebook.

We ended up chatting online that very night. And the next day. And the next. We met a few times to study for our final. We chatted more – we didn’t do much studying. After our final, I asked her out to dinner. We stayed out until 2 in the morning, walking around the city.

At the time, I had just left a relationship of two years. It wasn’t a good one. There was a lot of breaking up and getting back together. My ex and I knew we weren’t right for one another, but couldn’t bear to leave. We hadn’t been faithful to one another either.

I told the new girl about this. She told me that she had a challenging relationship too. She wasn’t from Singapore, and had an older boyfriend back home who was hoping for her to return and start a family with him. She wasn’t ready yet. She wanted to see the world.

The final we took together was our last final, so we both had a lot of free time. We saw each other every day. We went for walks on the beach, explored the city with our cameras, and, after her roommate moved out, I’d visit every night after taking her home. The first time I went, I saw her large bookshelf. The books on it were almost identical to the ones on my own. We talked about the writers we loved and the ideas we loved. That was when I knew I had fallen for her.

We were running out of time together because she was about to fly back home, and from there, Japan. So one evening, after a movie, I confessed my feelings for her. She smiled and told me that things couldn’t work, but it was nice that we had the time together as friends. Then that night when I was about to leave, she told me not to go. We gave each other a big hug, locked eyes for a while, and had our first kiss.

The next morning, she gave me a call, and sounded very serious for someone I was able to chat so openly with just the night before. She couldn’t sleep, and had Skyped her boyfriend and told him what had happened. He forgave her, but told her not to see me again.

I had booked a restaurant for us that evening because she was leaving the next day. It was a fancy restaurant. I promised her that it was just a goodbye as friends, and after some whining on my part, she agreed. 

We both dressed up for the dinner and had a great time. She had mussels and fries. I had steak. We talked about the serendipity of our friendship.

I joked that I said hi to girls on the bus all the time. She was upset for a moment before I told her that the truth was in fact the opposite: I never said hi to anyone even in class.

She told me she was glad I said hi to her. She told me that she liked that I was brave.

We said bye to one another outside. But when we gave each other a final hug, we couldn’t let go. I didn’t want to say goodbye, I told her. She said the same. After a moment eyeing one another, we kissed.

We went back to her place and I ended up spending the night.

I had work the next day, so our final, final goodbye before she got on her plane was a bus that we rode together. Looking back, it feels poetic that our last goodbye was on a bus. We held each other’s hands so tightly and didn’t say much.

Would things work out? We didn’t know. She had a boyfriend. She was moving away. 

But before I got off the bus to make my way to work, she told me she loved me. From the sidewalk, I waved goodbye to her, and her me. The bus drove off and tore our gazes apart.

As soon as I got to work, I went into the washroom and cried quietly.

Things fell apart soon after. She told me she couldn’t leave her boyfriend. I told her that I loved her, but in my loneliness, I went back to my ex. My ex ended up sending her a message, and told her that I didn’t really love her because I had gone back to my ex.

The girl sent me a final email, telling me that I had betrayed her trust because I had told her that I loved her while I was actually with someone else. She told me that we could never talk again. She blocked me on Facebook so I couldn’t see what she was up to.

Time passed. I’d send her an email every month, telling her how I was doing. She never replied. I eventually stopped.

Two years later, I graduated from my masters. I thought of her again, and decided to make a fake Facebook account and see what she was doing because she had blocked me. It turns out she married her boyfriend back home.

My own relationship ended up a wreck, as expected, but things are better now for me. Though I still think of what happened with that girl every time I pass somewhere we went. 

It was torture for a long time because the house she rented a room in was on my commute to school every day. I’d think about her all the time.

The other day, I took the bus to that house and decided to look around. It was empty and overgrown, because they’re about to redevelop it into condos. I peeked through the windows into her old room and thought back to our time together. I hope she knows how much she still means to me.

453,"TLDR: Freshies, do what you want to do in life, even when nobody seems to stick with you for life. And give back because giving back rocks. (But if you can, please read this essay. I think it's important to consider the points I made inside it :/)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sitting inside the ever-crowded Utown Starbucks earlier this Wednesday afternoon (even more so due to the 1-for-1 promotion), I see enthusiastic freshmen huddling in groups while I continue to miss the hustle, bustle and ever-recurring journeys that university life had brought upon me. As a fresh graduate from FASS, I constantly recalled my days as an undergraduate; the times when I was just like any other undergraduate trying to stay afloat in school, while attempting to be socially and academically relevant as a result. And so I just wanted to share my thoughts with the newly-minted freshmen from my faculty and otherwise, and to give you an insight on what this undergraduate journey may be. (Key word is 'may'!)

As freshmen, you guys and gals would by now, be getting to grips with Week 1, and your first forays into a new and potentially exciting chapter in your lives. You've got, or probably will get, social cliques and groups from orientation camps, tutorial and lecture groups. Many of you would have Whatsapp or Telegram group chats that date from these undergraduate experiences; your phones would be buzzing with people asking for lunch, Starbucks or study outings on every hour of the week. Your lives would seem socially fulfilling and exciting, and your energies are at a high at this point in time.

But university life is a challenging phase not only in the academic sense, but also from a 'social' perspective too. You'll soon see that not many people of whom you're seeing or talking to, would stick with you after the end of the semester, or the academic year. You'll constantly meet new people, without the certainty that you'd consolidate close - or intimate - social relationships with. There'll be too many people of whom you cannot 'tahan' or seem to understand; you'll find their flaws and differences too overwhelming as much as they do so with respect to yourself. You'll see your group chats falter away, with others forming smaller or individual chats that exclude yourself. You too, would watch your seniors, prospective juniors and batchmates take their turns to showcase their exchange or NOC adventures on social media, be it in the USA, UK, China, Laos, Myanmar, South Korea and so on. You'll be left out in one way or another, wishing you could still connect with those of whom you felt were the ones of which you would keep for the rest of university life and beyond.

You'll feel, alone. More than once.

There may be countless times of which you'll feel too different to get along concretely and deeply with anyone, and feel like a stranger who is embedded in a community you believe in so much, yet who constantly seems to be excluded from everybody else without a close group of friends. 

Because I was one of them, probably one of a few.

As an undergraduate, I don't even know who my close friends were or are in NUS. And I still don't. Everyone around me seemed to know me, yet my most common interactions are rooted in my role as the photographer. I constantly felt that I was understood for what I did, but not for who I really am. I often meet so many people, freshmen and other undergraduates alike, yet I don't even know who I can hang out with (sigh ugh! =( ). I feel alienated as a machine, yearning for friendships that I'll never have, resigned to the almost-certain reality that I cannot find a social group here worth calling mine, or an life-partner of whom I could freely express myself as a person and not as an instrument. Yet I constantly did photography because it was something I loved doing, something that satisfies me and other people in the same time; something that produces and gives meanings to others who belong in my community. It was my gateway to reaching out to so many people of whom I could potentially be close to, yet fail to do so because of my own personality difficulties and awkwardness, failings and lack of constant geographical presences. It was bloody addictive, and sure as hell damn fulfilling.

So if you feel like nobody understands you, or cherishes you as much as you do so to them, focus on developing yourself and finding something that gives back to you so much that you can write long essays on and feel so fulfilled from. Be who - and what - you want to be, and people will respect you for that. Love yourself, even when nobody seems to love you. Remember to give back to people whom you love the most; even if they do not reciprocate the efforts you give for them. Strive often to give without accepting anything in return; all of us are not entitled to reciprocate those who make our lives positively in more ways than one. This kind of 'giving' is a huge reward in itself, try it soon if you haven't!

Now, I've formally left undergraduate-NUS life with too many acquaintances and too few real friends to keep (and as I said, I don't even know who so many of these friends can be). But I left this phase of life with a much clearer idea on how I can contribute to others and make peoples' lives for the better. I am thankful that I found something worth doing - and critique sharply at an academic and social sense - even if I feel like everyone else misses out on me because everyone seemed to be too busy with each other. Freshies (or freshmen), please find your direction in life without overstretching yourself unnecessarily, and give back to your future juniors in whatever way you can and love; because this enriches you in many more ways than you might ever imagine. Because, I know I did, even if I may never know who you may be.

And as I enter yet another fleeting conversation with freshmen and other undergraduates alike, I take comfort in that I made you laugh, love, or positively feel towards the photographs I took for all of you. It brings joy to me when I know I impact your lives positively, even if I would never be able to know the subject of whom I photograph. Even if you would never concretely understand why I chose to do all of what I did, year in and year out. 

Even if I would never, talk to you again.

I know I've probably stuck around for too long, but I have no regrets in doing what I had done, even if I'd always felt 'placeless' in a wonderful community that I feel such a large part of. But it really is a time to say a 'geographical' farewell.

I hope all of you find your place in NUS, no matter how challenging it may be. Remember to love, and one day, love will come back to you :')

Sincerely,
Some laojiao here whom you might know (and indeed see or hear of) but talks too much on social media. Wayyyy too muchhhhhhh.

P.S. Do freshies even use Facebook these days??? :(

To the comment(s) that this sounds dubious: yes this doesn't necessarily happen all the time. But it's possible. AMA & I'll respond. 

1. It's not uncommon to have a large stock portfolio from your offer because if you join a company early, pre IPO or pre M&A, the value can go from nothing to 200k in 2 years or 6 months. There's an entire website & database of tech companies where you can filter by funding rounds and founding date. If you don't know that exists, you haven't done your homework. It's a common website. Also, top VC lists job openings on companies they fund. 

2. My colleague worked as a high school teacher for 7 years, went to coding school and now works as a junior developer. You want any job in the US, you just need to be able to do it. Even if your degree was in Culinary Arts but you have a great UX portfolio. Don't think the whole world works like Singapore where your major is everything. 

3. And by never stop trying, I mean learn everyday, take Coursera, Udemy courses. Build a portfolio. Learn whatever skills you need for whatever job you want and apply for a year to 1000 job postings and pray that 10 will give you an internship or interview or even talk to you. Then try to pass just ONE. And then pray again the one you passed is a good job, not a shit one. 

4. Learn to write GREAT cover letters in less than 150 words. Get a LinkedIn Premium account. For job applications you already want, send the recruiter a sample/portfolio of your work for that industry or product. Network in groups, ask for referrals and introductions. My cold mail on LinkedIn got me Skype interviews because I write TERRIFIC cover letters. That comes with job experience of course to know what a role/company is looking to solve. 

Once I downloaded a data set in that vertical/industry and sent my analysis to the recruiter, without being asked to. I didn't even get an interview. This happened a lot. They already filled the position. So a lot of shit happens all the time too. 

It's dubious if all you do is blast send a resume and cover letter to job applications, fail, and just accept the best offer you got. End of story. 

It's hard to have a vision of where you're heading or when you're ever going to succeed. But do something that betters yourself everyday, improve everyday and you will eventually get there somehow.

455,"I graduated from NUS 5 years ago, terrified of my 3.34 GPA from FASS. The major did not help, neither did my GPA. Every path I looked and considered I saw a dead end. Can't join Unilever, P&G or any of those great companies because I can't even get past the online rounds! Can't do anything in marketing or business related because they have enough Business Grads applications! Some of my friends told me I expected too much & I'm unrealistic. 

That's one way to look at it. 

Today, I work in Silicon Valley on the strategy and analytics team. I have a great job, great work life balance, have a job where I'm learning every single damn day, and have a great stock portfolio worth 200k USD from my job offer. I get fancy breakfasts, lunches and ridiculous company benefits. Also, unlimited time off! And they are serious about it really being unlimited. I've taken 5 weeks vacation this year.

A lot of people think I'm just lucky. Well, lucky is what happens when you seriously NEVER stop trying, even when you wonder if this is ever going to end or you're being stupid & ""unrealistic""? Lucky is trying again and again when you are so damn sick of failing perpetually.

Dear SG undergrads, Singapore employers look at GPA and it's a death sentence if you don't have a decent one at home. But that's just Singapore. The world is bigger than that. Don't stop trying, have patience, don't expect to succeed overnight and be smart about how you try again. There's always something you can work on and better yourself in. 

TL;DR: there is really hope even if you graduated with a shitty GPA, non-practical arts degree and fail all the online tests at every single company you applied to.

I can't recall the number of times fellow students have accidentally exposed themselves in front of me because they haven't figured out the art of sitting properly. Sometimes it was in the tutorial rooms (esp Business, where the TA likes to split the class into two groups with us facing each other). Sometimes it was in the canteen. Or in the libraries - in those days we didn't have modesty panels, and there was a wooden beam under the table that ladies like to put their feet on, so when they do that, their legs open slightly and you can see everything. The colours I have seen were mostly white.. why do young ladies like to wear white underwear so much? Anyway, it has been more than 10 years. Thanks much for all the memories.

To fill in these empty times, I would try new things and what pass through my mind is to dance again, an activity I haven't done for months.

I admit that I'm not a pro at it, but I'm thinking of making myself a youtube channel to put these dances together and if I'm lucky I might get some small fame for it.

However, I know that some dances I'm thinking are couple and that's why I'm looking for a female student that's interested in it. No, I'm not looking for a date or a rebound or anything towards that romantic relationship way. It's just that it's better to make a dance from both sexes' perspective, specially since I plan to use some songs that usually hit right at the feels.

If you are reading this, I'm sorry for being annoying when I want to talk, needy because I miss you, emotional when I care and insecure because I am afraid of losing you.

I miss the times we used to stay up late at night talking and laughing at stupid things, the lunch/dinner dates before your work, hearing you complain about everything in life, and being your personal bodyguard/entertainer. 

I miss the way you smiled, I miss the purity and innocence that flowed from your heart, I miss your simplistic views on life. 

You were a hermit in your very own shell, and I was that social butterfly ready to party. I wanted to bring you out into this great big world, but you convinced me how warm and cosy that shell of yours was. 

We wanted to elope far far away, to a cosy village by the beach, away from the chaos of technology and hectic city life. 

But I guess, now that dream stays a dream forever.  I am never good with words, and even more so with an apology. I made a grave mistake, and I know its unforgivable. 

A, I just want you to know that even though I cant be with you, I will always look out for you in life. Stay happy and safe.

464,"Hi V. 

I don't even know if you follow this since you study in NTU. 

It has been 3 years since we last properly spoke. Kinda knew this was going to happen, but never imagined it this way. You were my bestfriend, my pillar of support. Hence it wasn't a surprise that when you sent me that SMS and dissapeared, I crumbled. But I'm okay now.

My mind will time and time again revisit our last few months together as BFFs. A barrage of guilt ensues. What did I do wrong? Why didn't I see this? It must be me. Maybe. At least that's how I see it.  

It has been 3 years. I don't blame you. You made a choice. And I believe that decision was made after much thought. It is you to consider all possible options, to think wholesomely, to be wise. It must have been a tough choice for you. It must have been the only possible choice for you. I must think of it this way. 

It has been 3 years. But when you came to visit me unexpectedly in the hospital when I was warded about 1.5 years ago, I still felt that emotional connection with you. Maybe because you were nearby and you knew my other friend was coming. Perhaps both of you were going to the same place after. It must be. I must think of it this way, and not anymore.

It has been 3 years and whenever I see your posts on FB/insta, I wonder how you have been. If you are handling all the various issues of ""adulting"" and ""growing up"" well. The same issues that made up the bulk of our conversations back then. The smiles in your photos makes this likely. 

You must be. I must think of it this way.

For if I didn't, I would not have stitched up the void that you inevitably created when I received that SMS that day. 

""I can't maintain this friendship at this level anymore""

And, by the way, if you are wondering. Yes. I'm fine too.

Love,

465,"Congratulations to all graduates this season! You've put in your time and effort and now, really, the world is what you make of it. Let me share some thoughts I have about my experience in university.

I recently met up with two of my friends who went overseas for their university studies. One went to LSE to study political science and the other went to UPenn to study economics. I'm not quoting them just to name drop branded universities. I hope I can make a point about our education system, specifically levelled at local tertiary level institutions like NUS, NTU, and SMU.

I told them about the myriad opportunities that I had in the NUS Science Faculty, about my experiences - personal, intimate, fun, tragic, sad, amazing - the friends I made, the trips I had, the knowledge I studied, and the theories I applied. I am really grateful for these experiences.

But! As I recounted my attempts to tactically and strategically manage my CAP and hedge my S/U options, sometimes by opting for easier modules or modules that I was strong in, my friends started looking at me quizzically.

Then I remembered.

There was no such thing as The Bell Curve overseas.

I found it weird. I still find it weird and I will always find it weird until it is abolished. The last I checked (and contrary to academic convention) Wikipedia, 'the word ""university"" is derived from the Latin universitas magistrorum et scholarium, which roughly means ""community of teachers and scholars.""'

How can the bell curve promote such a community? One may conjecture that the S/U option in the first and second years promotes learning across the board. But even if the policy is correct, the overall culture has warped its intended effect. I am ashamed to I was influenced by this tragic culture as well. I S/U-ed some of my major's modules when they weren't up to mark, instead of reserving them to explore other knowledge domains. I offer similar criticism of the General Education modules (although I enjoyed them quite a fair bit).

People talk derisively about others ""wrecking the bell curve"" etc. I do find it amusing, but it is tragic. It is a tragic reality when we are taught that in order to get ahead in life, someone else must be pushed down the rankings. Yes, it teaches us that we must work with others, but that we work with others in order to get ahead on our own. I find that notion dubious and sad because it is quite untrue. In life, we collaborate so that everyone moves forward together. Contrary we to the (cliche) African proverb that is so widely quoted, we're not even going far and we can't even run fast. This leads me to my next point.

The other gripe that I have with the bell curve is that it puts us at a less than competitive level on the playing field. Graduates from other universities have higher GPAs due to fixed and absolute marking scales. Comparatively, if we're applying for the same job overseas, I am at a distinct disadvantage*. Even on home ground, overseas graduates may (and I emphasise MAY) stand a better chance because of reputation, although this is much more subjective. If reputable universities such as LSE and UPenn are much better off without the bell curve, why can't NUS/NTU/SMU be a real university by doing the same?

So my question is: why do we still have an outmoded bell curve in place? Save future generations the pain and suffering of having to tell themselves that ""they're not good at subject X"" because they got ""wrecked on the bell curve"" and give them a hand when they're applying for jobs.

If there is one criticism that is consistently levelled at Singapore, it would be the rigidness and lack of creativity in our students. Can we ""engineer"" creativity? I don't think so. For Singapore to be truly a world-class educational hub, our students who have worked hard to get into a tertiary-level educational institute must have the freedom to explore and settle into their domains. They must be given a chance to fail. The S/U option is good. It encourages that. But I personally feel that the S/U policy is a battle won in war that was already lost a long time ago. We lost the war against rigidness, over-competitiveness and lack of creativity when we stuck with the bell curve.

I know the counterarguments: grade inflation, Singapore ""can't afford to fail"", or that we have an economy that needs a consistent supply of the ""correct"" graduates at this point of our economic development. I've annoyed many professors and tutors by launching into tirades against the bell curve, even if I was on the good side of it (and no, I don't pray to the bell curve god).

But please understand this principle: what got us here, will not bring us there. We need to learn how to get out of our comfort zones, accept failure, move on, and continue to do what we enjoy. Yes, this sounds supremely cliche and un-pragmatic. It sounds like what an ""ang moh"" would tell a Singaporean: the pragmatic, tough-thinking Singaporean. But I'm tired of the clarion call for pragmatism. For one, it doesn't always work.

So, to my fellow graduates: don't leave university with the same mentality that you had while going through it. Life isn't cut-throat, painful, and full of unbearable sufferings. You may have had a good ride or you may have had a bad ride, but what depends is how you ride your life from now on. You can find friends and colleagues who are willing to collaborate and move forward. You can find what fascinates you (and if you already did, jiayou!) You will face setbacks, failures, and dreadful encounters - but you can S/U those failures in life. You can erase them from the record. They happen, and we can learn from them. Life is not a bell curve, neither is it a final year project. It's an ongoing sculpture that we shape with our thoughts and actions.

I apologise for this rant/advice/whatever you want to call it. The meeting with my friends really triggered some thoughts that I had ever since I stepped into NUS as a young freshman 4 years ago.

*Disclaimer: I am not saying this because I am a sour grape. I managed to find a job that was suitable for my skillset, and I am thankful for that. It's not extremely lucrative, but not desperately underpaid either.

466,"Thank you to all who provided kind comments on #38924, which I wrote two days ago. I greatly appreciate, and am much heartened by, your encouraging response. Many thanks also to those who kept the conversation going by providing additional tips and suggestions in the comments!

In response to #38988 and others who may be wondering about the same, it is possible to get relatively low-priced food at UTown from the following providers: 
- mixed rice stall at Koufu (from $2.30 for 1 meat and 1 veg); 
- soup noodle stall at Koufu, next to mixed rice (from $3 for pan mee); 
- soup noodle stall at Flavours @ Utown (from $2.80 for pan mee);
- mixed rice stall at Flavours @ Utown (from $2.60 for 1 meat and 1 veg);
- Nasi Padang stall at Flavours @ Utown (from $2.60 for 1 meat and 1 veg)
- Szechuan stall at Flavours @ Utown (from $3.30 for a rice set, which includes 1 dish and 1 egg).

Note: 
(1) To get these prices at the mixed rice/Nasi Padang stalls, do not select special types of meat such as mutton, duck wing or whole chicken drumstick. Choose only standard meat dishes, or one of the vegetable + meat stir fries, as your meat option.
(2) The NUSSAVE 'Project Box' discount is applicable at Flavours @ Utown, but not Koufu. However, at Koufu you can use your own lunchbox to avoid the 20 cents surcharge that is normally applied to takeaways. Remind the operator that you are using your own takeaway box and that he/she should not be charging you the extra 20 cents. The waiver is discretionary, but tends to be given. 

These above are the lower-priced supply sources available at Utown. Of course, at UTown you can also get mid-range prices ($3.50 to $6) from stalls such as Fishball Noodle (Flavours); Ayam Penyet (Flavours); Korean (Koufu); and Indian mixed rice (Flavours & Koufu). There's also Astons at Flavours, which costs more (from around $7) but is still cheaper compared to other Astons outlets outside campus. Hwang's Korean (which is standalone, not part of the two foodcourts) has prices starting from around $5 for noodles/bibimbap set. 

In general therefore I don't find UTown particularly more expensive than elsewhere on campus, given the availability of the more economical options mentioned above. That said, it is true that you can get slightly cheaper food at Techno Edge (check out in particular the fishball noodles, 'S&S' Indian rice, and Chicken Rice stalls, if the queue permits). Prices for these start from around $2 depending on what you get. At The Deck, claypot rice starts from $3.30 (see also #38924, item 5), and you can get stuff from the Noodles and Chicken Rice stalls for even less than that. The Malay food and Indian food stalls at The Deck usually charge me around $3 to $3.50 for 1 meat and 1 veg, which compares very favourably with prices for the same items outside campus. Of course there's also McDs on campus, where Value Meals start from $5.

If you happen to be at Bukit Timah Campus you will find that prices are rather higher at The Summit, so to speak, though you can still get away with a rice meal for around $3 or less from the Malay or Chinese mixed rice stalls depending on what you take (rice + egg + vegetable does the trick every time). Or you can order a stir-fry item from the relevant stall; prices start at $2.80. Besides The Summit, other options on and around that campus tend to be pricier.

Except for the McDs Value Meal, separate charges apply for drinks (from around 60 cents for kopi-o), which can be avoided by bringing your own drinking water (a healthier option anyway).

Relatively affordable food options just outside campus include: Fong Seng nasi lemak on Clementi Road (provided you limit your choice of dishes); NTUC Foodfare at Clementi Ave 1 (Casa Clementi, ground floor); and Food Junction at Block 443 Clementi Ave 3, next to the bus terminal.

Happy hunting, and I hope you enjoy the wide variety of food options to be found at NUS and its surrounding areas!

I've been single for more than 2 years now. When I was walking down a street alone earlier, I saw two people - a lady and a gentleman, walking side by side chit chatting. Their conversations were full of laughter and seems to be never ending. I walked behind them for at least 10 minutes and didn't walk past them because the street was pretty cramp with constructions happening at the side. 

Being a working adult who is not attached and have not dated since the last break up in early 2015, I suddenly felt lonely. I remembered I went through the exact same process with my ex Boyfriend. The part about finding out more about each other, sharing stories, enjoying each other companion even if it means a Long walk ahead, can't wait to see each other again, can't bear to leave each other and all. Those feelings, I suddenly miss them. 

I'm sure I don't miss my ex anymore. I probably just forgotten how to date or love someone anymore. 

Yup. Finally I let my heart out :)

468,"Apart from reducing/refraining from drinking at Starbucks, here are some tips to new incoming students - especially those living on campus - about how to save money and operate within a limited budget:

1. Familiarize with the distance-based fare calculation rules at https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/public-transport/buses/bus-fares-and-ticketing.html . Try to keep your trips within a Single Journey to prevent the system from charging you up to $2 more for a ""New Ride"". At times you may need to take the bus instead of a second MRT ride, or take an unintended bus ride in the general direction you are heading in, to keep your 'journey' active once you are approaching 45 minutes between rides.

2. Depending on where you wish to go, it may be possible to take the BTC1 shuttle bus, which is free, as far as College Green on Bukit Timah Road and then catch a bus from there, which can be cheaper than taking an MRT/bus ride from campus.

3. Bring your own food containers when taking away meals from canteens. Thanks to the NUSSAVE (NUS Students Against Violation of the Earth) initiative, you get 'Project Box' stickers worth 40 cents each, which you then redeem for $2 off once you accumulate 5 stickers. You can still hangout with friends while eating from your lunchbox, or if you have relatively fewer friends, eat in your room and save on drinks.

4. When buying mixed rice, be wary of vegetable dishes that also happen to contain meat as these are charged as meat dishes (not vegetable) and will cause the price of your meal to increase.

5. Did you know that you can get significantly more rice from the claypot stall at The Deck by buying large rice (red bowl) instead of regular (white bowl) for only 20 cents more? If you are feeling particularly peckish, this is where you should head to (provided it's open) rather than coughing up for more small servings elsewhere. 

6. Pharmaceutical items are significantly cheaper in a certain neighbouring country whose currency is about a third of the SingDollar in value at the moment. If you do not have free healthcare insurance for outpatient treatment here (check your eligibility, don't assume) it may be better to stock some over-the-counter items from there to self-medicate for common ailments if the need arises. If the information is not already written on the packaging, just ask the dispensing pharmacist to provide you with an information leaflet on the medicines you plan to carry into Singapore, in case of awkward questions at the border. Note: consult a medical practitioner if the symptoms persist.

7. Always read the Straits Times on Thursdays (provided free at Central Library, other NUS Libraries, and some hall/residence common rooms). Thursdays are when the two big supermarket chains - NTUC FairPrice and Sheng Siong - advertise what items are on discount for the coming week, so you know where to pick up your regular food/grocery needs. (check out in particular the centre spread and the back page). In the Friday papers look out for ""3-day discounts"" applicable over the weekend. Alternatively, log on to the respective chains' websites and check out the applicable promotions every Thursday or soon after.

8. Did you know there is a store called ""ABC Discount Store"" at Clementi Town Centre which actually sells common food/cleaning/personal care items at significantly cheaper prices than regular stores? Students on a shoestring budget should check it out if they haven't already - same row as the POSB, look out for the gaudy yellow and red signs. 

9. Sheng Siong has a house brand called ""Happy Family"", and NTUC FairPrice also has a wide range of house brand items. Go for these if you are minded to save a bit here and there - often the quality is not inferior to that of leading brands.

10. Look out for non-invasive psychological and other research studies to participate in on IVLE, the Yale-NUS study recruitment platform, the Department of Psychology notice board, and selected bus stops. They generally don't pay much (some at Duke-NUS pay quite handsomely though) but they can cover a lunch or two, are generally quite fun to do, and depending on the experimenter you may actually get to learn a thing or two outside your regular vocation. 

Saving money and living within a preset budget should be a way of embracing moderation in life, eschewing excessive materialism, and squirreling away a little here and there for a rainy day. Sure you will not get rich by doing these things, but you will learn to live within a budget, hopefully be more self-sufficient, and appreciate the daily difficulties of those who live from hand to mouth. Moderation and prudence should never be a platform to disdain others who were perhaps lucky to find themselves in better circumstances (as the recent furore about drinking at Starbucks demonstrates). Instead, in challenging yourself to have an great university experience while living moderately, you set yourself the aim of leading a simple life which nonetheless touches the sublime.

469,"#38884: I stayed in KE few years back and moved out after one semester. Won't recommend if you're particular about cleanliness and want a conducive room to study in. So many random insects entering the room on daily basis, yet you can't close the windows because it'll be really stuffy :( Ceiling fans are old and very noisy, water heaters and washing machines/dryers not working properly. Also there is no lift and the hall is on top of a hill, I remember my room was on 4th floor and I needed to climb about 7 flights of stairs before I reached my room. Food is horrible. Sorry if I sound like a spoiled kid, just honestly sharing my experience here, see if you're ok with all these things. Also noted that during my time, people there are not as bonded as those staying in other halls, not sure if things have changed, current KE residents pls correct me if I'm wrong.

Its been a year since we last spoke to each other after we broke up. I do miss you occasionally, miss your texts, miss your voice, but i know that we will never be able to get back together again. Those happy times, as short-lived as they were, created memories that I will always cherish. We fell apart, not knowing how to love each other nor did we even try to learn how to love each other. We were complacent, and took each other for granted. Don't blame yourself, we had our moments, angry moments, sad moments, happy moments, just like any other couple and it was truly a blessing to be with you. But I guess that we were never meant to be. I thank you for breaking up with me. I hold no grudges and I wish you a good life.

Just a translation of a set of lyrics which you might not have understood otherwise 

《爱着爱着就永远》

刚刚才告别了冬季
I just waved winter farewell
泪还在眼角结著冰
Though my tears are still frozen at the corner of my eyes
和你 相遇
And then, I met you

伤痕有相同的气息
We seemed to share the same pain
在适合相爱的天气
In this weather so suitable for falling in love
为你 犹豫
I... gave you a second thought

我们在寂寞中靠近 拥抱中痊愈
We got closer amongst our loneliness, we healed in each other's arms
却不敢轻易说爱情
Yet we don't dare talk about love
有些人爱着爱着就变了
Some people change midway in love
而誓言爱着爱着会忘记
And forget the promises they made

我们在微光中前进
We take baby steps forward in the dim light 
暧昧中小心摸索著幸福的道理
We tread carefully in this relationship, trying to figure out what blissfulness is all about
怕只怕爱着爱着又放弃
We're just scared we'll give up eventually
有没有爱着爱着就永远 的幸运
Will we ever be lucky enough to find our forever love?

说不定永远很容易
Perhaps forever might be easy
困难的只是谁愿意
But it's hard to find a willing party
全心 全意
Loving with all of their heart

He was kind of like me and told be that previously he got cheated by his gf and got some issues with family. So when I saw him, I feel like I saw myself in the mirror and sympathize him and I think from there my love starts to grow for him. I was doing my final yr in sch while he was alry working. His research work is quite tough as in he is quit ambigious and I understand he has alot of things he wants to do. It is very  hard for us to even meet once a week. We live quite close but he will always says he is bz and ask me to understand. I feel quite alone when I saw my friends who has a caring bf. I still try to understand. I dun demand like fancy dinners and expensive presents from him. When we have time together then we will eat at foodcourts or walk around city and download and watch the movie together. 
Last few months I was really having a hard time. I was the only child and my parents have high expectation for me. Somehow I cannot find a job after my exams. I am a foreigner and my pass is going to expire soon while I still cannot secure a job yet. I told him about all these but instead of supporting me, he somehow becoming quite distant from me. I start to run out of patience and we got into serious fights. It is quite tough for me and I lose my will to continue living. I asked ""should we break up?"" and he accepted. He says we won't be happy together in this RS anymore. Later I found out that he was going for further studies and he wants to break up and focus on his studies. He hides this until we break up. I feel so betrayed and hurt with no one to talk to.  He asks me to all the blames to him and find someone better. But it is hard for me when I finally trusted a person and it was not a happy ending. I dun think I can open up to another person again. In a moment, the person who used to be ur closest becomes a complete stranger again and all the promises vanish in the thin air.

Well, even if she's not, I still sympathise with this girl's situation, and even more so after seeing some comments on the post (especially one particular comment, you know who you are) which are rather harsh. So you're saying OP deserved that ""slap in the face"" for being immature and having no courage to fight for what she wants? Seriously, please have a heart, fate already punished her enough for being ""too obedient"", she doesn't need another slap in the face by you. 

Anyway, she sounds like someone who's already learnt her lessons and now sharing it with us so we can learn from her experience, she's NOT asking us what to do? Your harsh words serve no objective other than to make her more upset, don't understand why you wanna do that? 

You may want to put yourself in OP's shoes. What if her definition of ""best"", something that makes her contented, is seeing her parents happy? We have no rights to judge her for it, perhaps there are some sacrifices that her parents made for her in the past that makes her feel so indebted, we never know. Imagine someone whispering in your ear that you have made a wrong decision every other day and tell me if your opinion is not swayed a single bit. If someone calls you stupid/ugly/fat every single day, sooner or later you'll start thinking if you really are stupid/ugly/fat, no? We're all human beings with feelings and not machines. Sometimes we can't help but do things that people want us to do just to shut them up, because we're sick of their nagging, not because we have no mind of our own and think they're right. Even if she had been more matured and courageous and married one of her exes, you think she'll ever be happy with her parents badmouthing her husband for the rest of her life if things don't go as planned (guy stays in low paying job etc)? Money is one thing, other things that her parents dislike such as immaturity, manners and class are hard to change I guess, so it's likely that the parents will forever be unaccepting. So either way, she'll still suffer. We all gotta admit it's not an easy decision she has to make, and definitely not easy kind of parents to deal with. 

Seriously, if you have nothing good to say, you'd be better off keeping quiet. Cheers!

481,"When I was in JC, my parents told me to break up with my then boyfriend as they thought he was too young, immature and came from a broken family. He was a year younger than me. ""You'll wait forever to settle down with him,"" they said. So I did.

When I was in uni, my parents told me to break up with another boyfriend as he was in a low pay, slow progression job and his family was poor. ""They'll take advantage of us. Besides, these people have poor manners and no class, they'll put you to shame,"" they said. So I did.

Well, they did not explicitly said that we must break up, but they indirectly did with hurtful comments e.g. ""You must be prepared to suffer and work like a dog for the rest of your life and I cannot help you...."", ""If you stay together with him (my first ex), you'll miss out on better guys in Uni...."". I also found out that they had been constantly badmouthing my exes behind my back to my sibling and relatives. When I did certain things that they were unhappy with, they would tell me that it must be due to bad influence from my boyfriend. After a while, I just could not take it anymore and decided to break up.

Fast forward to today, both guys have stable jobs, happily engaged and seen on social media preparing for their wedding, buying house and all. On the other hand, I'm here nursing another broken heart after being cheated on (by the guy that my parents finally approve of, gosh), and had to deal with parents who kept asking why I could not find a decent partner despite having above average looks.

Maybe we shouldn't be too obedient and learn to stand up for ourselves sometimes, especially when our future is concerned, but it's just so hard when you're young, uncertain of what's best for your future and not confident that you can prove your parents wrong. Sigh.

483,"To op of #38032, 
I am an engineering student graduating in this coming July. 

My college life has been an absolute roller-coaster. My very first sem I had 4 Bs, 1 A and a cucking F in maths, which totally made me lose interest in working hard.

I skipped most of lectures and played dota with my friends in army instead, reaching like global top 20 in one of the heroes. (my only proud achievement in uni) 

The next sem I had 3 Fs, which put me in academic warning. Getting an F means that I need to take that stupid subject again and ofcourse I failed that subject again. Worse comes to worse, they were the core modules. I could not attend same class as my peers, due to the incomplete prerequisite.

The cap at the end of sem 2 was 1.62 or sth and I could not bring it higher than 2 at the sem3, which put me into academic probation. Also, the system labeled me as an year 1,due to the lack of number of the modules passed. 

Throughout my college days I had to take 6 or more modules every sem in order to graduate in time.( Which does not help raising cap) I also hated whenever my og mates asked me what subjects I am taking, or which lecture or tutorial groups I am in for their modules, which I cannot yet take. 

My very last semester was the craziest, where I took 3 tech depth, independent study, fyp, and 4 gem/ulr modules. The registered MCs for last sem were 44(crazy right lol). This is because I  wanted to graduate with my peers badly, and invite parents to the commencement ceremony(which I cannot attend if I graduate after special  sem).
 After the most intense(well I still went to play dota here and there LOL) semester, I did not fail any modules and even got A for FYP! I am graduating with a proud 2.26 cap.  
I managed to secure a job offer from MNC on programming role before graduation and I am very happy with where I am now. So if I can do it with 6 Fs and academic probation, you can do it too! Just plan out the modules beforehand so you won't have to take crazy number of modules on last few sems. Make sure you don't get Fs and everything will be fine. 

I hope I helped. Thanks for reading and have a nice day!

But the words you said, the manipulation you did, and the hate you spewed at every turn stays fresh in my mind.

I guess I should care for you.

After all, our society thinks the aged are to be cared for by virtue of their seniority. Never mind what a terrible being you are, bullying others, animals and loved ones. You tried to teach me that social inconsideration was natural, and no one can be trusted for they are all back-stabbing evil beings who are out to hurt us. As a child I was taught that the world was a disgusting, filthy place and that home should be the best thing on earth, no matter how awful it is for me mentally. I grew up with few friends and my social inability is acute even up till today.

I guess you have a long-term mental baggage that you cannot help but be mean.

You're nice one day with praises, and then demeaning the next. You'd curse me and wished me a terrible life ahead. I have a different opinion? How dare I! Growing up was painful, as everything I did was wrong in your eyes as long as I did not obey. Slowly, I learnt to not take your words to heart, learnt not to feel, and learnt not to open myself to you. 

I never shouted, screamed, hurt or contradicted you. I silently took your abuse, by virtue of your seniority.

Today old age has caught up and you are lonely without friends. 

You begged me to spend time with you, and say you loved me. But yet I feel nothing. The child that used to live in me, who would look up to you for recognition, for love and for kinship is gone. She has learnt that emotions are terrible, she has learnt not to feel.

I guess I should love you.

So I went to the toilet halfway during the lecture. Sat on the toilet bowl, hoping the pain would go away. But it didn't. So I proceeded to book a grabcar back home.

I needed a plastic bag just in case, I texted my girlfriends, none of them read it because we were having lecture. So I texted my guy friend, felt embarrassing to tell him about this honestly. He told me he didn't have a plastic bag but he'll help ask around if his friends have one. He found it and suggested he passed it to me at the girls toilet. But I told him to pass it to one of my girl friends to give it to me instead. Couldn't thank him enough coz I really did throw up right after the car reached the front of my block.

Major shoutout to my beloved good boy boyfriend. Yes, he doesn't club, doesn't smoke and doesn't dress up. Yes, he wears lupsup slippers, pe shorts and school shirt to school everyday. Yes, he doesn't game, doesn't flirt and doesn't shop for anything.

All he does is work, study, family business, comm service and love me. :)

Never a day will he neglect me and have fun on his own. Never a day will he get angry at me for throwing tantrums. Never a day will he raise his voice and scold me. Never a day will he fail to comfort me when I cry. Never a day will he ignore my messages. Never a day will he not put up with my shits. Never a day will he not treat me like a princess. 

He holds back his sex drive as I am a virgin even after getting the green light from me. He is in elite course but still gives me all his time and attention. Doesn't come from a well off family but still gives me all the things I want.

All our friends said we are incompatible as I am not worthy for him for I was once a quite slutty girl. Truth is, hey, people change and your mindset has to change too! Watch us PDA and continue spreading words behind my back. I will remember to invite you for our wedding. Xoxo kthxbye.

507,"Dear BL,
If you hate me deep down or you still blame me for not choosing you in the end, it's because I had false hope more than once. Once bitten, twice shy you know. I learnt my lesson the first time. I guess I just didn't want a half-hearted love anymore since the aftermath is HELL. Next time you love someone, please don't hold back and be half-hearted if you want all of that person, especially if you know she throws in 110% the moment she makes a commitment. It's been about half a year and yet, the mark you left and what we could have been still breaks my heart over and over again. We hardly talk anymore and our interactions have gone cold, but I still remember the beautiful times we did have together. Maybe I should have been more patient with you...after all, you have your own hurts and reservations that made you indecisive. However, I let you go because I knew my optimism would only ever be a dream... you will never be able to give me the simple love I crave and deserve. You are a bird that has big dreams and needs to fly and I didn't want to be the girl that stands in your way.

I've since chosen a guy that loves me more than I could even imagine and yet sometimes I still find myself missing you in the dead of the night... Oh the stupid feels... I wish we could return to the time when we were just good friends who hung out with our clique :(

509,"What A Big Relief...

To me, 4 years in NUS here is a pain in the ass (not literally though).

I used to be a scholar in my Secondary School and JC time. My inept in English language finally takes a toll on me as I received my A-level result. I got S for General Paper and C for my humanity subject. Although, I had As for everything else, I was very certain that the grades will not make the cut for a university scholarship. I gave a straight face to my friends and teachers. Then, I cry like a lil bitch for a month or so.

I was lost and never found. I really didn't know where to resort. Although it was pretty clear that staying in Singapore is the way to go, I wasn't really sure how. The tuition fee for International student will be 60 thousand dollars, that's probably the amount of money both of my parents make in their lifetime. If you live humbly, the cost of living in Singapore is still around 1000 dollars per month. So yeah, I definitely couldn't turn into my parents for everything.

However, I made a decision to stay. It couldn't be possible without all the loans that NUS and local banks provide. I only need to pay around 3000 dollars for school and accommodation per Sem. I consulted my parents about it and they say ""we will try our best"". It was nice that my parents agree with my decision. However, I didn't mention that such amount of money is not enough. After all, I am an adult.

I chose to wait tables for a living. The pragmatist will see that tutoring is the way to go. The dollar is just more, and I need the dollar. I still don't buy it though. I despise private tutors. Helping those rich kids to climb the ladder in a much easier way than I did. I sound like an ignorant man  here, but seriously, I wish to start a Singapore-centric Khan Academy for everyone, for free. 

Besides waitering is a pretty fun job where I get to exercise and see pretty girls (Oh, shit! Girls, please don't report me to the police). However, Boys!! I am very certain that girls will less likely to reject a nice fancy meal treat. Moreover, I was able to interact with people outside my social bubble. My colleagues ranges from Filipinos, Poly and ITE graduates or just students who want to make some pocket money. 

My best friend there was an ITE kid raised by a single parent. We have strongly different views on what a good life is about, but surely, we enjoy the customer's warm truffle fries and sneaking in for a scoop of premium vanilla ice cream. Although, waiting table doesn't pay much, it was definitely a break from a mundane and competitive academic life.
Now that I have settled for a more future secure job, I kinda miss those time where I have to be social.

Back to the story line, my 4 years in NUS basically just study and work. During the term time, I study on the weekdays and work on the weekends. During the holidays, I work as much as possible so that I can have more study time on the term time. Friends what friends!! can my friends pay for my food?! (Just kidding.. I have a lot of friends that has supported me along the way). I also make sure that I am healthy. I have enough food to eat. I also spare some time for exercise. I really can't afford to get sick.

I can't believe that it is almost over for me (besides the loan's interest that will haunt me for the rest of my life). Beyond this point, will my life be happilly ever after? I doubt so. I already have a 9-5 job and a crippling debt. I will probably be a corporate slave for the rest of my life and  not getting promoted because I am a foreigner. Or, Maybe there is a world war 3 or something. Nah, too much of shit talking. I wish you guys all the best for the exams. (last one for me :P)

Alright, I need to get back to study for my last exams.

I still remember that day, when it was raining heavily and our eyes met under the dim lights of the bus-stop. I found you attractive, twinkish just as how I imagined you to be from the photos you sent me of yourself. I was shy, and you showed me the way to your room (and your heart). Subsequently we did so many things which I never would have dreamed possible on my own - holding your hand in the cinema, etc. We discover more about ourselves as time goes on, and we share certain interests which keeps our conversations long and meaningful. We have also went through some adversarial times together, which revealed the fragility of our emotions and psyche, but our love remains.

514,"I had a huge crush on this good friend during my Junior College. However, my feelings for her are never reciprocated. Back then, I did many little things for her and kept dropping a lot of hints to show my affections, unfortunately she friend-zoned me again and again.

It was okay for me to just be common friends, but I felt after she realized I've got a crush on her, she started to distance herself from me and began treating me like an acquaintance, then slowly, a stranger. Whenever I ask to hang out with her like we used to, she would always come up with an excuse to reject it, saying things like, ""Oh I already have plans to meet my friends, but you don't know them right?"" and ""Sorry, I need to study. Test is coming."" I felt really hurt that she couldn't even spare a second for me. Soon, she barely replied.

It is natural for guys to have crush on girls, and I am not shy to admit it, yet I couldn't fully understand why she just could not be more open-minded about it; it is not like every guy who likes a girl will definitely find ways to ""eat"" her up right? Maybe she was really that conservative and my affections for her are making things awkward between us? Or maybe she already had someone else in mind? Or I am not tall, good-looking or popular enough for her standards? These questions have always been bothering me.

Nonetheless, I reluctantly respected her decision. She is a good and hardworking girl and I do not wish make things difficult for her. From then on, we seldom communicate. Occasionally, I will just sms or WhatsApp her to wish her happy birthday or send greetings on several annual festive seasons just to keep in touch. Unfortunately, she did not reply at all for almost a few years although I assumed she had seen it (the two blue ticks appeared?).

During my NS, she went to another local U (not NUS). Once in a while, I will meet up with my ex-JC classmates for a meal to catch up and she always happened to be there. But when our eyes met, I will usually wave and say hi, but she will sheepishly smile at me, then come up with some random topic to the person next to her as though she didn’t even want to interact with me for old time sake.

I felt very hurt that I immaturely kept swearing to myself I shouldn’t go for hangouts anymore, thinking that she will begin to notice if one day I am not present. But I can’t help it and still turned up subsequently. I guess I have to accept the reality that the world doesn’t revolve around the both of us; I still have other classmates whose friendship I treasure dearly.

Okay, so in Feb. I randomly ran into her again. I was preparing to leave my house for a jog with the dog and she happened to be walking directly outside. Apparently, she was working as a part-time property agent and she was putting ads into the letterboxes of the landed houses around my estate.

On a side note, my family is quite well-off and we live in a large bungalow in a prime area. But since our fortune is inherited from the work hard of previous generations (the so-called aristocrats from the pioneer generation), I am quite shameful about it because my parents (especially father) are very lazy, useless and spend most of their time enjoying life and burning cash with travels, golf, pointless social events and so on while thinking these good days will last forever, and not sparing a single cent to help the less fortunate in Singapore. I am okay with them being rich, but I am not okay with them bossing people around and always thinking they should have the last say, without lifting a damn finger to contribute anything useful to the community or the economy. Right, nuff said! 

Anyway, my friend looked very amused and she asked if I lived here. In my confusion, I told her bluntly yes but I was not planning to sell or buy any houses and pretended I forgot to take something and turned back to my house. But I was taken aback when she treated me with so much friendliness and warmth, and gave me a flyer and telling me what she is working as (she is both property agent and financial consultant at the same time, is that even possible?), and kept insisting we should catch up.

I felt a little uncomfortable because I prematurely guessed she might be planning to sell me some unnecessary financial plans, insurance or something, to earn herself a commission. With all due respect, I have had a fair share of unpleasant encounters with these groups of persistent sales people. But business is business, it is an absolute fact that everyone wants to make a living. So I invited her into my garden to talk about what she is offering over a cup of drink. In fact, I was already willing to accept whatever she was offering as long as I can afford it, just to show my support for an old friend. 

To my surprise, our conversations barely revolved around I thought it would be. Instead of giving me a sales pitch, she talked to me about our good times in JC and all that personal stuff about herself that she had never ever shared with me. So I just listened and anticipated whether the sales pitch will begin soon, but it never did. Even during the trip when I gave her a lift out to the nearest bus stop in one of my mum’s car, we just kept engaging in very interesting small talks. Gladly, nothing to do with business at all.

From then on, once in a few days or a week, she will message me and asked how I am, and whether I am free to meet up. We did met up a couple of times, and we even watched Power Rangers recently, and I enjoyed every occasion we were out together. She is cute, but not exceptional in any way. Yet I cannot explain why I feel so excited and happy whenever I see her. Her natural charisma maybe?

To think about it, I felt a glimmer of hope to pursue a relationship with her. A proper relationship which I very much desire for so many years.

She had been giving me a cold shoulder all these years (about four to five), and now, I sincerely felt that she really wanted to rekindle our friendship. However, as you would have guessed by now, I am not a fool. There is always this judgmental and critical subconscious who is telling me that she just wanted to get favors out of me after only recently learning about my good background.

But to give her the benefit of doubt, I assume and hope that her change in attitude is due to the fact that she is now more mature, and hence maybe she regretted for ignoring me over the past years, and wanted to patch up? Am I being too wishful to believe this? Also, can I only blame myself for trying too hard to pursue a relationship with her during JC when she is not ready, and thus accidentally made things awkward between us?

On the negative side, perhaps she is another gold digger which I heard so much about (even on NUSWhispers), although I never actually met or knew of one before. Do you think this is the case because everything just happened too fast?? (FYI, earlier this year in Jan, she was still in the stage of ignoring me when I sent her a ""Happy 2017"" greeting)

Why do girls so readily ignore guys who like them, and then so easily pretended nothing has happened with just a snap of the finger? Is it wrong for me to judge her that way? Is there really some kind of misunderstanding on my side towards her? Was there some kind of difficulties she was going through previously? I don't know!

I am pondering if I should asked her straight in the face about what happened to her before, especially on why she had been ignoring me for so long until now. However, I fear it might be super insensitive of me to bring this up; maybe in life some stones are just meant to be left unturned? I feel very bad for judging her in a negative light.

Nevertheless, I shall continue to hang out with her and see how things go.

Thank you for taking time to read my first post. Since I am quite a private person who doesn’t like to discuss about these things in real life, it would be superb to have some online advice.

Please Wish me luck!! I have been lonely for so many years and gave up many opportunities because I can't get my mind off her. Hopefully, this is a chance for me to find out whether she truly is the one for me.

516,"28 March 12AM. 
The clock has struck 12. It's not your birthday anymore. 

For the first time in six years, I didn't wish you a ""Happy Birthday"". You said that you only wanted to receive wishes from people who cared (which is why your birth date is not on Facebook). Well I didn't wish you because I want to stop caring about you now. It may sound petty, but anyway, you stopped caring about me three years ago. I never really knew why. 

They say that first loves never work out. Our complicated relationship was a testament to that. Things ended as abruptly as it started. I still remember that night, when you texted me to say goodbye--even though we both knew that neither of us wanted to call it quits. Maybe it was because we were both young and foolish. And we let our anger get the better of us. 

Months later, we became friends again. I was always hoping that I'd bump into you on my way home from school. Alas no, it was not meant to be. 

We finally met again a year later at a carneval. I knew that we both felt something, but why didn't you say a word then? Why didn't we just enter the haunted house together? Was it just because we had both bumped into our friends and that it was too awkward not to rejoin our group? It's been 5 years since I last saw you. But I heard that you've been doing really well. I wish I were in a position to be proud of you, but I can only be passively happy for you now. 

People say that your first love leaves a permanent imprint on your heart. For one, the number 27 will always remain special to me. Even though I'm with someone else now, I still think about what could've been from time-to-time. However, I no longer feel the same way about you. I'm no longer looking to be with you. Maybe I'm just looking for a sense of closure; selfishly wishing that I've also left a small, albeit permanent imprint on your heart. Just as you did on mine. 

In retrospect, I guess it's pretty apt that I stopped wishing you a ""Happy Birthday"" in the year you turn 21. It's a subtle way of not entering your adult life. My memories of you are already tucked into a little corner of my mind. Now, it's just time for me to let the dust settle on them.

Based on how you acted during class made me perceive you to be snobbish and lazy. Then in the middle of this sem, we were allocated to be in the same group project. I was initially excited as I've got to be grouped with you but after realising how your personality is, I was actually more worried. As we were doing our project, I've come to realise that you are actually the most helpful group member among the rest of us. There was certainly no obligation for you to stay back a few times after lesson with me just to perfect our project, since grades don't affect you. Now I'm really glad to have the chance to talk to you and know your actual personality. I'm really comfortable talking to you, you don't seem to mind my 'ungracefulness' for a girl and I really like how your eyes look at me while I talk to you. I can sense you really are interested in whatever I was saying. Especially how you asked personal questions which I usually am the person who asks these to my closer friends. Finally felt that someone actually am interested in me (maybe not exactly in a romantic way but a friendly way). It's rare to find people who has the same wavelength as me in terms of sense of humor. It's surprising how you get my jokes even though our cultural backgrounds are so different. I like how we can freely tease each other. Now that we've become closer as friends, glad that we would intentionally sit nearer to each other for classes. I'm afraid to take our friendship to the next level, afraid to jeopardise our friendship especially when I don't make friends so easily. It's so difficult to find people like you...Just wanna tell you how appreciative I am to be given this opportunity to meet you from this module class which I almost didn't bid for.

Which is a resolute energy of directions

In front of the mixing momenta.

Dear My one and only mike Ross. 

take my hand and let's walk through this. 
listen to my heart for it is beating for you. 
believe me when I say I want this and I want you. This is a conscious choice/ decision I'm going to make to commit. Not because of routine but because I care about you and us. 

I know we have hit an edge. 
It wasn't rainbows. Fk it may well be winter here already. I suppose this is one  the downs of the roller coaster of relationships. 
There are bumps and hiccups along the way. But I know for sure I am stronger now to face whatever is thrown at us. 

We both have opened to each other, and seen our raw, vulnerable state of one another. and I'm ready to take you in. I'm going to embrace you. This is enough, I will no longer let unimportant people words sway me. Because they are just mere specks while you, well you have become my everything. 

When you sent me that message, I ached, for god, I cried. The fact I have been so selfish, so inconsiderate, so rash and ended up hurting you has greatly troubled me. 

So no more of this. I don't want you to feel like this anymore. I will have strength. And trust in me. 

Open to me about your worries, I want to your confidant, your shoulder to lean on. Your troubles are mine. Let me share with you not only your sweet but also bitter moments. 

I'm here for you just like how you have been here for me. 

I love you.

She should be predictable, and most of the time constant, but ever ready to provide a guiding map from one state to another at will.

539,"Hey guys, as a senior I would like to share with you three things about relationship which most people overlook their importance:

1. ""Kinkyness""
It is very important to have a soulmate who either does not mind or shares a weird fetish with you. It may sound perverted but these things keep relationships intangibly irreplaceable by looks, money and even both. A very delicate dose of tickling is an example. Something that drives you crazy in bed can last a lifetime and supersede all else. This is true for both male and female

2. ""Rebelliousness""
An overly submissive or oppressive relationship harms both. It is usually never felt by one side until it is too late into the skew. Look out for good feedback mechanism in the relationship. For instance, if you threaten to hurt, your other half should be able to threaten to hurt you just as bad. That way you know you will not leave her simply because you can. Sounds kinky huh, but it works well for the long term

3. ""Kinderness""
When we reach 30s or going to, it turns into a realization that being any older will not cause any greater enlightenment than the fact that hiding in the shadow of being ordinary while doing extraordinary things is probably best strategy out there to keep your bread fresh and aplenty. This limits your mental euphoric option to... innocence. There is a child within us that needs attention and you should figure out through conversation and ""roleplay"" to quench this attention with great ease. At least make it easy for each other. When we feel the circle of understanding is complete through our relationship, we feel the circle of life to begin the next phase. Help each other to complete this circle. It could be something as simple as eating ice cream on see saw or having hot chocolate milk in a school canteen. Anything that makes the heart warm is good, sharing it is great, but recreating it faithfully... I would die for the person.

If you find someone with these qualities, marry him or her. You won't regret it. Money and looks come and go but some things just stick around...

When you are prepared to marry three times, once for love, once for money and last one for companionship, you will realise finding a companion to share your most secret moment together is probably the best deal on earth.

I married once for companionship and it is very stable for more than a decade. Cheers!

540,"To My Ex,

As you had taken the first move to cut me off, I will definitely respect it and would just like to thank you for that year we had spent together. I'm sure by now you have realised that we are blocked over all forms of communication devices and Facebook as well (so I probably can't even see any comments you may write here if you recognise this), but this is my final goodbye before we can consider our ties cut off forever :)

We were silly weren't we, thinking in the future we could ever get back together? It was already clear that we could not possibly be happy together due to our differences in personality and restrictions placed on each other.

I have found others who have reminded me to be happy and have surrounded me with love and warmth and lifted my spirits and confidence, some basic necessities that I had even forgotten were there before.

And no, by 'others' I don't mean a replacement (of you), but I mean all my wonderful friends and family who have been there, and suddenly rallied together when the r/s ended (although I have to admit I can definitely breathe better now that my friends of the other sex can talk to me normally and engage with me in group convos like before, without me having to fear your unhappiness and anger at this). 

I am very grateful for everyone who had stayed in my life even though I feel I had neglected them a lot due to my entering a relationship in the past year. Was that expected when I entered one? Sure. And I'd like to say I don't regret it either :) in fact I just wanted to merely point out how blown away I was by how understanding everyone had been, and how blessed I feel now that I have gotten over the first period of 'sadness' that came with the end of our r/s.

Anyway, I'm happy now, and I expect that the only way our lives can go from here is really, sincerely, up. And so, I'd like to wish you the best, out of the bottom of my heart, and hope you will be able to do well in work in future. And I guess it's dumb, as I'm not sure you care or even want to care, but I am doing fine, so don't you ever have to worry about me again in this lifetime yeah! 

Just run to your dreams and don't give up, gambatte! :)

Farewell, to our happier days ahead!

I'm the OP of 33195. We might just be in the same boat, I think. Sometimes I don't even get turned on with him on bed. Even if he's touching some sensitive spot it's the same feeling as someone caressing my palm. Apparently this doesn't change if it's everything before sex, or sex for me. Does that actually mean it's not that I've a high sex drive too? Trust me, sex and everything before sex kinda feels the same. You probably just feel a little bit more connection with your partner when it comes to sex, that's about all. And it's definitely not because I'm horny too. It's just that for some reason, I wanna do it. I may be studying halfway and not feeling horny, but I end up doing it. Pretty weird and it's affecting me a lot these days cos I tend to think about doing it almost every night even when I do not wanna do it. Glad to know that I'm not the only one.

I'm happily in relationship for almost 3 years now, but i have this strange / weird addiction to watching porn online. 

Myself & partner live together and we been enjoying good sex life and went for couple of vacations past 3 years. She's beautiful and has good physiques .. just like how she was before we got official and dating days.

But i'm just so much engrossed into watching online porn. Ok let me clarify, its not like the porn-porn that you think. Its actually live cam show sites like Bigo / Chaturbate etc where you see real girls , like next-door types doing their business when they receive their tips / beans etc.

Whenever there's opportunity i'm alone, i'll quickly get myself ready to watch these live cams.. and these are really addictive! There are times you have to wait like hours to see someone strip, or even wear something very revealing. There are times when you don't even get to see anything sexual / revealing.  This kinda gets me glued to it for hours just for the excitement / thrill to watch it. Rather than watching regular porn, where they quickly strip off & do their business (i don't enjoy that at all these days)

I'm not sure if someone have anything in common ? I'm trying to find someone to speak with to check if there's any abnormalities with me.... 
i don't cheat on her and have never slept with any other females since we begin dating.

Is this considered as cheating ? Is this kinda strange addiction considered abnormal ? I need some advise pls ...

I was very surprised and did not know how to react; surely he was one of the most important person to me, but I couldn't tell back then whether I ever liked him romantically. Stupid me was afraid to upset him, so I decided to give it a try. Sadly it didn't work out; a lot of things happened afterwards, which made me realize even though I treasured him so much, I didn't like him as a boyfriend. However, instead of sitting down and talking to him to salvage the relationship, I was such a coward that I just left and let him realize what happened on his own. 
I was horrible, that's for sure. Everyday I wish I could have handled the matter differently so that I wouldn't have hurt him like I did. We haven't seen each other nor talked ever since, so I guess I'm not forgiven. Serve me right, but I miss him a lot. Sometimes I want to strike a conversation with him, but I wonder whether it is selfish of me to do so; I'm afraid it might remind him of the not so good time I have put him through.

I must apologize that I took such a long time to reply because I never had the intention to reply to your post. However for some inexplicable reasons, I decided to do it now.

Perhaps I'm just being sentimental after watching Kimi no Na wa and La La Land in the theatres recently. If you have not done so, please do check them out! They’re splendid films and I believe you’ll enjoy them, especially La La Land (It’s kinda like a musical and you absolutely adore them)

I'm really glad and honoured to know that even after all this time, you still have me in your thoughts. 

Truthfully, my heartstrings do still get pulled whenever I see your pictures on social media and hear your name. I can never comprehend the reasons to why you chose to unceremoniously leave me and cut me off from your life 4 years ago. 

Was it because of the difference in Faith or my depressive disorder? Perhaps your current boyfriend can offer you something which I can't? 

However these reasons do not matter much now. Just like how you took me a lot of courage to choose to walk away, it took me the same amount of courage, if not more, just to move on with my own life. 

I'm doing okay now and I am in a stable relationship. 

I do not deny that somewhere deep down in my heart, I still have feelings for you. The time we shared, it’s not easy to forget. You told me that time shall heal us both, to assure me that we will eventually move on this heartache and from each other. 

We did move on with our respective lives and yet the scars that remained constantly reminds me of the special times we had, what we could have been and the lingering pain of us becoming total strangers to one another. 

I don't know if we would ever find our way to each other again as we are both spiritually and geographically so far apart right now. No matter what happens, I will always wish you happiness and all the best. 

This is the least I can do for you.

554,"Since everyone is talking about relationship now, I would like to share the story about my first love. 

I was 17 and he was 18. We met while working part time and realised we both study in TP but different Programme. He hated me because I was his senior at work even though he was older than me and yes, he was a typical Beng who never once stop using vulgarities in every next sentences. After multiple quarrels over work matters, he one day dared me to ""ton"" overnight under block with him and his friends. Being egoistic, I did. Instead of quarrelling, we were trying to find out more aboout each other and ""argued"" to protect our own ego. We eventually fell in love. Before I share more about how we started and ended, I need to emphasise that my part time job was extremely important to me as I need to pay my school fees without parents support. 

He was really sweet to me and did everything he could just to spend more time looking at me. That includes putting more schedule to work together. One night, he sent a long sweet text asking me to be his Girlfriend. I agreed. Being a typical Beng, all his friends told me that it's their first time seeing him work hard for his Girlfriend and he must have loved me a lot. I can't deny that. The sweeter he was, the more deeply I fall in love.

After the ""honeymoon"" period (sorry, I totally DONT BELIEVE in that kind of thing), he started to spend more time with his friends. Joined gang, gotten tattoo, visited pubs and clubs, smoke a lot more.. and lie. He changed from ""even if I don't have money, I will bring you to eat the best food"" to ""eh, get your pay already right, help me buy cig leh"", from ""let's go town walk walk"" to ""I no money go out. I want to sleep at home"", from ""don't overwork and tire yourself"" to ""you so free go work, I no time"". I never once thought of giving up because all I knew was I love him and his ""good self"" will come back as long as I wait patiently. I paid for almost everything he wanted including tattoo and bought expensive gift for him that I struggled with my money. I almost quitted school due to outstanding school fees. 

Maybe I should have spoken to my friends about it so they could have advised me to end it off earlier. But I didn't share with anyone and cried every night on my own, feeling so hurt from not having the attention I needed. 

One day, my colleague texted me in the mid night and said
""I saw XXX on bus leh! He going out so late?"" 
""No la, wrong person la, he slept at 10pm leh.""
*sends picture* 
*dumbfounded* 

I texted his Sister to check and she guiltily admitted that my ex had been lying about him being at home. I burst out into tears. I went 711 to grab a can of Tiger because I really wanted to know why was he so addicted to drinking in pubs and clubs. I swear (at that point of time) it was the worst drink ever in my life. I threw away and walked to his house (since I was saving every single cent I have) and his Sister allowed me to stay in his room to wait for him. I cried for next 4 hours before he returns home drunk in the morning. When he opens the door, I could see his shocked face and suddenly turn ""drunk"" face. He came hugging me and asked me why was I there and kept saying he really love me a lot. My heart melted. I'mgonna forgive him, I told myself. 

But I'm still not that comfortable that I decided to check his phone and computer. To my horror... I found out that he prostituted, and planned with his friends about who should start to ""touch the girl"" who went to the pub with them before passing to next one and in constant sweet contact with another girl. He was still dead sleeping. I cried in the living room and his mum asked me to go home and rest first. 

When he woke up, he called me to ask where I was. He denied and said it was his ""gang leader"" is cheating behind his Girlfriend and needed to use his phone to call for prostitution and text the girl. I trusted and forgave him. 

We didn't meet for next few days and I suddenly receive a text from him asking for break up. I broke down in the middle of the mall. I called him and confronted him and he replied one or two word for every question I asked. He cried too. For someone who don't even drop a tear after gang fights, it was my first time hearing him cry. My heart soften, I said good bye and that's how we ended. 

I'm still single and he is now married with two children. I am still hearing about him and his life. I was told that his Wife is mistreating him and his family and taking kids for photo taking purpose only (that's cruel). Sometimes I still thought that if only we continued, I would have been the one and I will never do what the Wife is doing now. 

But I guess, that's what he gets for always cheating and ended up with a shot gun marriage. No hatred, no nothing. I always remember my first love because this relationship made me knows what I want and not want in a relationship. 

That was my first love and also the best relationship I've went through. Because no matter how hard I think, most of the time I still only recall all the happy moments we used to share.

555,"I recently saw some posts comparing two different guys with descriptions of their characteristics, after which OP asked for help to decide which one she should choose. It reminded me of my own love story where I faced such a dilemma and ended up with a wrong choice, and I just felt the urge to share it here.

Early last year, after being single for almost 3 years, I was so glad to get to know 2 promising guys at around the same time. Let's call them A and B. A works at a private equity firm earning > $10k a month, branded goods and luxury watch collector, owns a car and lives in a condo. B is a relationship manager at a local bank earning ~4k a month, with humble family background and lives in a HDB flat. Looks wise, I would say B is slightly more attractive than A, just FYI in case you're wondering, but this is of little relevance to my story.

From the start, B showed more gestures of care and concern compared to A. For instance, many times he would wait hours for me to end my OT just so that we could take the train home together. Not only that, he would purposely take a longer route home (almost 20 stops) so that he could send me home first. He texted me every morning and afternoon to remind me to eat breakfast and lunch as he knew I often got really busy and skip my meals. He also remembered little things well, like sometimes I would make casual remarks about some places that I want to go to or activities I want to try, then he would surprise me by bringing me there for our next date, sometimes postponing appointments with his friends to match my schedule. Meanwhile, A did not do as much, but bought me expensive gifts and brought me to many 'atas' restaurants that I've never been to. On top of that he was good with words and kept saying things like ""I'm so lucky to have you"", ""you're amazing"" etc. Guess who did I choose in the end? Silly superficial me chose A. I even got excited at the thought of my future life with A, when I could probably stop working, enjoy taitai life and go on extravagant holidays. I decided to be honest and opened up to B about A. B was so devastated he spent the night drinking alone, fell sick and took MC for the next two days. His last words to me were ""I really like you but I understand, A is an N** graduate and earns so much more than me. I feel so inferior."" To be honest, I felt really sorry for him at that time and didn't know how to respond.

Fast forward a month later, I got together with A and all went well...till I got dumped mercilessly via text all of a sudden with no explanation just three months later. Soon after we broke up, Facebook revealed that he went out with another girl, whom he also dumped a few months later (as told by a mutual friend). I was so blinded by all the material things he lavished me with and his sweet but empty promises, I didn't realise that his wealth and flair for words meant that he could do all these effortlessly, to any girl and not just me. On the other hand, B's thoughtful actions obviously required much more effort on his part, suggesting that he genuinely cares and probably more serious about having a proper relationship with me, as compared to A who took advantage of his high flyer profile to play with girls' feelings from time to time. How stupid I was not to be able to see that. 

Some of you may say, ""Why not try to rekindle with B?"" Well, I would if I could, but he just got married to his sweetheart last week...

As I was writing, I was suddenly reminded of this poem below (credits to Lang Leav). Indeed girls, choose love. Of course, the fundamentals must be there first (e.g. Matching educational level and a decent job), but once these are met, don't be too fixated on wealth and instead, go for someone who truly cares about you, envisions a future with you and works hard to make it happen. You and your partner can always work harder and earn more money, but it's near impossible to change someone's character and force them to give you the love that you deserve. Also, don't quickly chase away a decent person who cares about you just because you feel no 'spark' for them, do give them a chance and reasonable amount of time to prove themselves worthy. 

Thanks so much for reading everyone, I sincerely hope you don't have to learn these lessons the hard way like I did.

We hit it off really well the first time we met; talking for hours and only realising she had to go off so she'd catch her bus back. We didn't meet too frequently then because she was always travelling with her other exchange friends to different countries. 

I enjoyed the times we spent together and even though I really liked her, I didn't pursue the feeling further. I left it at that. I'd think of her from time to time and sometimes we'd message each other for a bit.

Fast forward to 2 years later, I am now on exchange in the same country that she is living in. Of course she was not the main reason for my desire to go on exchange in the same country (we're not even in the same city). But when I visited her city and we agreed on meeting up, somehow everything I felt came rushing back in.

Now that my term here is coming to a close and I'm going back to Singapore in a few days, I feel like I'm going to lose her again but this time, it feels even more painful. I know she has to stay in Europe for the next few years (and I have to stay in Singapore)...but I have this urge to confess to her (though I expect nothing to come out of it since I'm not looking for a LDR and I know she's not one to get into that either).

I am 25 this year. My 3-year relationship with my ex boyfriend ended 2 years ago. It was mutual. We loved each other a lot. We studied in school together, I attended his lectures (we were not from the same course), we over night in Starbucks and Macs to study, we took long walks to talk to each other, we played sports together. There were a lot of things we did together as a couple. All our friends called us the ""perfect couple"". We agreed. 

We eventually graduated together and became working adults. Unlike being in school that we can walk for a few minutes during breaks to see each other, our offices were far apart. We were both so committed to our work that we spent almost 80 percent of our day at work, including the weekends. At first, I thought that moving in to his house will solve the issue of having no time to see each other. We were wrong. 

We planned our future. How much do we need to save for our wedding? We applied for BTO. Which area should we choose? We talked to each other parents. Who will stay with us? We called each other parents Mum and Dad. We were so sure that our relationship will last forever. 

Relationship is a process full of uneven hurdles. Some couples overcome all hurdles and lived happily ever after while some couples chose the easiest hurdle to jump and went underneath the tall hurdles. We were the latter.  Sweet moments when we tried to know each other. Tough times when we tried to settle our differences. Tolerating each other when differences could not be accommodated. Eventually, we became each other's habit. We wake up, kiss good bye and head to work, contact each other for dinner after work, go home, watch tv and sleep. This cycle repeated over a few months and finally REALISATION kicks in. 

We both knew we loved each other. We both knew we were almost perfect for each other. 

We forgotten love is not just about feelings. Love requires responsibility, commitment, time, effort and many more. We loved each other but were not willing to give each other more than just feelings. We decided to stop this unhealthy relationship and let go of each other. Maybe, maybe we will get back together when we are ready to give each other more than just love. We needed some time to search our souls, set our priorities right before we decide again. We stayed in contact. 

I guessed I did not think further. We mentioned that relationship requires more than just loving each other, but we did not say about the receiving party. He did not give me any thing more than just love not because it was not the right time, but it was because I was not the right one. He is now attached to his lovely Girlfriend for more than a year. I am really happy for him and no, I'm nowhere near jealous. 

This short 3-year relationship made me learned and grew as an individual. Even though I have been single since then, I knew I should wait for the right one who can make me give him more than just feelings. I have not met any for past 2 years and not sure if I will meet any in the future. But I'm sure, being single, independent (and sometimes lonely) is better than jumping onto a ship that may sink anytime. 

I'm surprised that I've never once hated my ex. In fact, I'm grateful for his existence and stepping into my life to let me learn important lessons from the 3 years worth of time investment. 

I do miss him still, but I will never want him back. I do feel lonely and upset at times, hoping that I will be able to meet someone asap for a comfort hug after a long day of work. I felt desperate. But despite these feelings, I'm still not ready to start anything new. I am confused about what I'm really feeling. Was I traumatised by losing the ""love of my life""? Have I moved on yet? Or I have I really not met the right one? Or did I lost the key to my heart that it can never be opened again? 

To have no idea what message am I trying to send by sharing my story and true feelings regarding my past relationship. I only wanted to tell ""someone"" because I have never told this any of my best friends. 

Sorry for the long story and thank you for reading!

Totally. The thrill of getting to know that someone is into you despite being attached, the feeling is inexplicable.just admit, dating apps and social events make meeting such women possible and truth is they crave for novelty, company and probably what would initially start off as an innocuous chat, a few extravagant dinners and dates sweep her off her feet. And the love making that follow suite, the adrenaline of knowing that getting caught anytime when the bf or husband is home while doing it, it really blows my mind away. Am 29, been through 4-5 of such trysts inter alia, and still going strong.

Perhaps, if we had known each other for a longer period of time, we could have built a stronger friendship. 

Right now, I don't think you would remember how I look like, would you?

Perhaps, it's my being not much of a talker that this friendship did not get the boost it needed.

I'd prefer to interact with you, in person, more, than through any digital means, because that means a lot to me. However, with the distance right now, I cannot even begin to sincerely empathise with your situation, halfway across the world. I am, really, no longer relevant in your life either.

Perhaps, it is best for us that, to me, you'ld become just another person in the crowd, a stranger, with scribbles all over her face like everyone else.

Perhaps, regretfully, this is where we part ways. Thank you for one of the most genuine friendships I ever had. And for the final time, stay well, yes?

564,"My second last semester in NUS is coming to an end this week. I have an unusually long studying period for my finals this semester and I have used it to reflect my last 3 years in this university.

I have come to realized that I have been hanging out with the wrong people. Don't get me wrong - I am not saying that the people I have been hanging out are bad people. I just disagree with their values in life, on what I think is important in life. 

I have also come to realized that there is no correlation between grades and 'good' family background and character and integrity. It's funny how the people with the wealthiest, most well-educated and successful parents often behave the worst than people with much less privileged background. The people who are the most driven to succeed, as evident by their drive to excel in examinations, can sometimes embody the most appalling and egregious character I have ever witnessed in my 24 years of life. The little moves they pull off to gain that bit of social capital; the myriad of lies they tell to mislead people for their own advantage is simply unacceptable to me.

Maybe I have chosen the wrong major, but my current course has around 300 people per cohort; yet I am unable to truly find a group of friends whom I can truly confide and trust in. Everyone seems to be so materialistic and calculate every move with hyper-pragmatism, and with all due respect, all like to spout anti-intellectual nonsense they read from shady websites with no evidence to back them up. To them, talent = good grades - not trying to claim there isn't a modicum of truth in this, but to judge someone's abilities solely by grades seem to be anachronistic. This overly simplified point of view probably has pernicious effect on Singapore's progress - I do not think it is a coincidence that so little focus is given to good journalism (lol, I know), fundamental research in science and team sports like soccer (why not develop local talent?).

To my juniors still early in their student career in NUS, I strongly advice you to treasure friendship that you know are valuable. You will need to put in effort to keep in touch with your friends. And if you sense that someone's character brings you any amount of uneasiness, please try to distance yourself from that person because chances are their actions will eventually hurt you or disgust you insofar that you lose some faith in humanity.

We learnt that when this person left, there was no fanfare, nor thank you lunch or even a farewell gift. To the management, it was more like good riddance to bad rubbish. (Yes DO, we know)

567,"Today, I would like to share a story of my academic pursuit before I enrolled into NUS this year.  I think its a story that some of us here would be able to relate to.  

Let's start with PSLE, the first major examination in everyone's lives.  My score wasn't fantastic, it was only a score of 210.  With that score, I got into a not-so-fantastic neighbourhood secondary school(I am not sure if I can call it average when you need about early 200s to get in).  I would say I am your textbook definition of a 'late-boomer'.  Topping my class in my lower secondary years, subsequently getting top 3 in my level and top 3 in my upper secondary class became something common.  It's not an achievement that was served to me in a platter.  It was something I achieved by putting in consistent effort throughout that 4 years.

I did decent for my Olevels and subsequently went to one of the single pointer JCs.

Coming to this JC(I believe it goes the same for other single pointer JCs), it becomes a common trend to see many of your peers come from decent secondary schools such as Cedar Girls,  SJI and TKGS etc.  Coming from my secondary school, I won't deny that I actually felt initmidated.  I ended up in the same class with these intelligent peers of mine who have obviously continued their trend of excelling in their academics after PSLE(You might disagree with me but this was exactly how I felt).  It's not the fact that I made it but rather the fact that I would be studying with them in this same JC that is initimdating.  

Getting used to scoring well back in my secondary school, I expected myself to also do the same in JC.  I reckon there wouldn't be much of a difference.

I was so wrong.

My results were bad.  When I mean they were bad, I am not being that asshole who claims that their results were bad JUST because they didn't get their As or Bs during school exams.  I truly meant that for every mid-years/block tests (or whatever you call it), failing at least one or two of my subjects in JC were common.  I would get grades like DEU/CEU etc.  Sure, there were instances where I scored like a B/C for my H2s.  However, those grades were achieved at the expense of my other subjects(H2 Physics is horrible).  The only time I passed all of my subjects were during JC2 Prelims(my grades were obviously lacking if you were to compare with my classmates).  

Within these two years, my confidence in studying was cruelly grinded away.  I always felt like I was severely lacking as compared to my classmates.  Also, it doesn't help that my class is always consistently among the top 3  3H2 classes for every exam.  Every single time, whenever I see XXXXX being flashed on the screen as one of the top 3 classes again, I felt considerably worse about myself.  

It is the hard truth but I knew that I wasn't responsible for that fantastic score on the screen. I was, in fact, responsible for pulling down the class average.  That fact was indeed a slap to my face.  While I did improve up to prelims, I felt that my improvement wasn't sufficient, as compared to my peers who were already scoring above 70 or even above 80 rps in PRELIMS.  Yet, I was only scoring 50+ rps.

As expected, my ALevel results didn't come out well.  Of course, my class was among the top 3 3H2 classes(as usual).  My results were far below my class average and I was feeding the bottom again.  I was again, responsible for pulling down my class average(Pardon my pessimistic thinking back then).

I cried and even wondered if I could even get into a local uni.  
My future suddenly felt really uncertain to me and I was absolutely terrified.  Before I even got my Alevel results, I already set on my mind on what course I wanted in science.  I really wanted it.

I still vividly remember showing one of my subject tutors my results and I asked him whether if I could get into Science.  I would never forget how he told me in the face that I could not enter NUS science with my grades and told me to just go to an engineering course.  

My morale was truly crushed back then.  

Luckily for me, I was offered by NUS to go for a discretionary admission interview.  I went for the interview and passed it.  And yes, I did end up getting into the course I wanted.  I am thankful.  I really am thankful to be given this opportunity to be in NUS, even more thankful for the fact that I got the course I wanted.  

I won't deny that I feel intimidated by my peers here in NUS and fear that I would flunk here like how I did in JC(especially when I barely made it into NUS).  I know, all this that had happened remains in the past and I should learn to let it go.  I guess I still need more time to get over my low self-esteem.  I am still gradually building my confidence in uni.  

I feel less stressed towards studying in uni and learnt to enjoy more what I am studying.(An attitude I will continue adopting and hopefully build my confidence better)  

I just wanted to share my story and I hope this has been a good read for all of you here.

For those of you out here who did experience struggles like me or are currently experiencing similar struggles, I really want to encourage you to never give up!  Stay hopeful!  Things will always turn for the better, it's a matter of time!  Don't give yourself too much stress and learn to lower your expectations.  Sometimes, it's not too bad to lower your expectations.  You never know that when you lower your expectations, you might even perform better!  What really matters is that you have gave in your best and have no regrets!  

Finally, be happy and good luck for those who are still having their finals!

I am the girl who wrote this confession and I felt like I wanted to share some other things didn't mention earlier on.

To those of you out there who have met someone whom you have mutual feelings with, but have no intention of looking for a relationship, I strongly urge you to not blatantly ignore the one you like.  Yes, I understand your intentions are to prevent feelings from continuing to develop, but that doesn't mean you have to resort to ignoring him/her.  

You cannot imagine how much pain and hurt you can cause to the person you like by this simple action.  What can hurt more than to being blatantly ignored by someone whom you like?  

You can always talk to the person you like normally.  Also, if you do find the need to distance yourself to let yourself forget your feelings, it would be much preferred if you were to come clean to him/her.  Doing these actions silently prove to cause more hurt than to be honest about it.  As long as you do explain why you need to distant yourself to forget your feelings, the person you like can only respect it.  You are also saving yourself less repercussions in the future, where you might be confronted by the person you like or their friends over your actions.  Trust me, things would end uglier if you were to not be honest about distancing.

I would also like to point out another thing.  And that is timing.

Z and I have obviously missed the right timing to get together.  When we wanted things to work, it was too late.  By then, what was left was our love built on past memories, and not of the current.  

So to all of you out there who have met someone who shares mutual feelings as you and do see a future with the person, I do encourage you to give it a shot!  Your happiness is in your hands and you have the right to choose what you want to do it!

Also, to all of you evergreen or green ladies/guys like me, I wish you all the best in finding your happiness :)

If you haven't, I wouldn't blame you because it's difficult trying to forget someone when you get reminded of the person's presence everyday.  You should know why I am ignoring you.   While this is not a nice move of me, I honestly cannot think of a better way for you to forget your feelings for me.  That is why I chose to ignore you, at the expense of blatantly ignoring your presence.  Initially, when you admitted your feelings, I thought it would be okay that I still treated you normally as a friend.  But no, it wasn't okay.  We became even closer and it actually prompted me to perhaps give you a chance.  I did try but my heart still says no.  It just doesn't feel the same way as you do.  I know ignoring you hurts.  If I had a better way, I wouldn't ignore you.  You made it really hard for me to treat you normally too.  You have been a really nice friend to me and I do appreciate what you have done for me.  I feel that all these has happened isn't pleasant and certainly not worth it as our friendship had soured as a result of this.  Whenever I see you around, it brings me a form of discomfort because we both know that we have things that are yet resolved.  You should know why it isn't revolved.  On my part, I have said whatever I could.  I didn't say it once.  I said it many times.  You never listened anyway.  Also, I think I told you more than once that I didn't like it when you touched my head whenever you see me.  You never listened too.  It also made me feel uncomfortable. Whenever you do it, what I can read from that is that you have not moved on.  And yes, the reason why I am ignoring you is so that you can take your mind off me and forget me(while also remembering that I am such an asshole for being cold to you).  I also mean it when I said I am not worth your time.  How am I worth your time when all I want is you to forget me and move on to find a better girl?  Also, I wanted you to think logically, choosing to move on when you know there is no outcome between us, instead of following your emotions.  Just recently, I saw you slumped on your table late at night, probably at 4am, when I was walking back to my room.  While my heart goes out to you for studying so hard for finals that you aren't even sleeping on your bed, whats even sadder is the fact that I can't even show concern for you openly, even as a friend.  

By now, you might have started to finally hate me for being so cold to you but really, all i want for you is to respect my decision and treat me normally like how you treat the others.  You deserve someone better too. 

Please, give me the chance of being your friend, back in the past when we first met.  Can we?

This post also goes out to those who have been rejected by someone you like.  If that someone you really like has already indicated their intention of wanting you to move on because they simply don't see a future with you, you really have to move on.  You are moving on for yourself, so you won't deprive yourself of opportunities to meet other potential partners.  Eventually, you definitely find someone who can see and appreciate the inner beauty in you that others cannot see.  That being said, it is also meeting that someone who would love you more than what you imagine.  Finally, please also understand that those who choose to reject you cherishes you as a friend too.  We certainly don't want to lose a friend because of a rejected confession.  It's not worth it at all :(

571,"This is my first confession ever on NUSWhispers.  I always felt like this is a really interesting platform where many people gather here to listen to heartfelt stories.  While reading numerous love confessions, I feel like it is my turn to share a love story of mine in JC.  
 
My story might not be very impactful but I would still like to thank you in advance for wanting to read my story.

The most right person I met in my life was this particular guy I met in my JC.  We call him Z.  We were classmates.  I can vividly recall the first time we talked was during freshman orientation.  I remember how we instantly clicked and soon discovered we had common interests, such as our music tastes and even love playing the same sport.  We also stayed near to each other, which gave us the opportunity to walk to the same bus stop together after school ends.  Gradually, we got closer and it became really apparent to the class that we spent a lot of time together.  Soon, my friends started ""creating"" more opportunities for us by always letting me to sit beside him during lectures, just so I could talk to him during lectures.  We also started to text more and slowly, he started asking me out to play badminton together.  I remember how I would also quietly watch him at the side and how my breath would be taken away with each stroke of his racket.  He always did it so effortlessly, like how he effortlessly made me fall for him.

Once, my friends asked him if he liked me, while we were hanging out.  I remember how I tensedup and thoughts of how he might not have liked me started flowing through my mind.  

""I like her, but I have my own considerations."" He unexpectedly responded.

What considerations did he have?  That caught me off guard and shortly after, my friend nudged me, teasing me how he admitted his feelings for me.  Then, they asked me the same question and I was too shy to admit and just brushed off with a shy smile.

That was when everything started going downhill.

When we went home, he started spilling his troubles, telling my friends and I how he really wanted to focus on his studies because of what happened in the past.  I guess what made me scared was when he told us to forgive him if he were to change.  At that point of time, I subtly got what he was driving at - he wasn't looking for a relationship currently and wanted my understanding of what he couldn't give me.  

That was also why I chose to confess to him, because I felt like since I already knew his feelings, it was also time he knew about mine too(although it was already pretty obvious). 
He admitted that he wanted my understanding and wanted to focus on his studies.  I could understand his intention and I respected it too.  I wanted to focus on my studies as well.

What happened subsequently was what I wasn't okay with.  Not at all.

Unlike the usual hellos and smiles he would flash to me, he chose to ignore me completely.  What's worse was how he could seem to be talking to everyone in a conversation but he would not look at me, not even once.  It was as if he ignored my presence.  It hurt, it really did.  Why did his attitude change so much?  What did he want to achieve?  I was not okay with how he dealt with things.  Couldn't we still talk normally as friends?  My friends started asking me what happened between me and him.  How could I answer them when we didn't even fight?  How could I answer them why there was this change when it wasn't me who wanted this?

This awkwardness continued to linger until J2, where things visibly got better because at least he could start joking with me a little and I felt more comfortable around him.  I was still not entirely comfortable with him like in the past, like how I could tell he still isn't really comfortable with me.  It frustrated me how he would take the initiative to talk and joke with our female classmates and how he never put in that same effort with me.  When it was just two of us, he had nothing to say.  I had nothing to say too.  And not knowing what to say is suffocating.  It certainly did not help when his good friend disliked me.  It made me more cautious and afraid when it comes to approaching him, especially when I see him hanging out with his friend.  The only time I had more guts to approach him was when he was alone.  But even then, I didn't really have anything to say.  I felt like he had moved on and my feelings were one sided.  He also started getting closer with another girl and I could see them hanging out in school.  It hurt my heart.  Whenever I see them together, I wished I didn't have to coincidentally pass by that exactly same place and see them laughing happily.  People around me started discussing about them and speculated that they might harbour feelings for each other.  It didn't feel good hearing about them.  And yes, I finished JC assuming that he didn't feel the same way as me.

It was a few months after JC, during results day where we met again.  We didn't talk but he still caught my attention and my heart still skipped a beat when I saw him(although it sounds really wrong because I was also attached back then).  It was later in the day where he texted me and asked me how I did when we started talking again comfortably, just as friends.

What made me really surprised was the long text message he sent me, telling me how his feelings for me was there throughout that two years.  I recall how I felt so happy reading this text and shortly after, how guilt and hurt struck me hard, reminding me of my current relationship status and my responsibility to stay faithful to my partner.  I couldn't help but badly wished he had confessed to me earlier.  I felt torn.  It was then it dawned upon me that my feelings for my boyfriend weren't as genuine as what I thought it would be and I think it was a reason why I always felt uncertain about my relationship.  I was also honest to Z about the relationship I had and how he didn't know I was attached, for he wouldn't confess if he had prior knowledge.  He felt really bad for ruining it too, although I reassured that he wasn't responsible.  I felt it was the best decision back then so I wouldn't hurt my ex. Yes I know I don't sound like a faithful partner at all.   I hated being that way too.

After ending my relationship with my ex, we gradually started hanging out and texting.  I felt really happy hanging out with him and I liked how that awkwardness we felt in the past suddenly disappeared.   We would spend long hours talking, holding hands and having short hugs at the playground till midnight and ending our meetups with his warm hugs was something I grew to love.  

It was as time passed by when we both realised that whenever we met, we were constantly talking about the past happy memories.  We rarely talked about the current memories we have and it dawned upon us that it was the past that bound us together.  We discovered that the feelings we harboured for each other was what that was built off past memories, and not of the current.  That was when we truly decided to move on from each other.

He was someone I loved the most out of all the guys I met, even more than the 2 exes that I have dated.  We might have stopped liking each other, but one thing would not change is the fact that he would always harbour a special place in my heart.  Looking back, he has brought a lot of laughter to me and while there are times I felt hurt from his actions, it was the beautiful memories we created that would stay with me.   

Hey Z, I don't think you would be looking through this website till 2 years later but if you do see this, I want to tell you again that you have been a beautiful memory to me and you would still be one in the future. 

Also, when we do have meet ups with our class, do come okay!

With love,
The girl who loved you for two years

Dear **, ** and *, 

Not sure if you'll read NUSWhispers but still let me post this here. I considered you in JC, but never the three at the same time as I am not that bad. It was a very stressful period in my life. I know this is not an excuse but I am really sorry if I caused you much hurt and ""toyed"" with your feelings. I've always wanted to message you saying how sorry I am but on the other hand, there is another part of me which thinks 'what if you have forgotten about our times together and no point bring up past hurt'. 

I am the type of girl that gets interested in people quite easily; as long as you have a good heart. However, I have the tendency to ""run away"" when I look towards the long term. I just could not stand some areas of you (ranging from character to physical aspects). I apologise for texting back everyday quickly, going out of dates, laughing at your jokes and then suddenly having a change of heart.

I wish you the best in finding a partner that fully accepts every single aspect of you. Hope that piece of your heart has healed.
