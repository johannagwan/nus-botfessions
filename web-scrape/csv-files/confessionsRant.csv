I asked my friend where all the Singaporeans from School of Computing people go, and he said probably banking. Is that true??? And on that note, YES I AM STILL TRYING TO HIRE!!

1,"I just need a space to rant and speak my mind. Currently in a long term relationship, and as things progress, my gf and I have been talking about our future arrangements/agreements. When it comes to money, she controls everything that I earn. Everything I do have to go through her too. Whenever I have a differing opinion to her, she gets extremely upset. She can’t understand my point of view when it comes from me, however she’ll be more understanding when she speaks to her friends about it.  She does have valid reasons for everything, and I can understand her point of view. But I am just not comfortable with losing control of everything that I do. We are both on equal footing in our jobs, and I’m starting to lose sight on why it’s worth sacrificing everything I find important to me to be with her. I have and am willing to compromise on things that are important to me as I know a relationship takes two to make it work. But to what extent? She’s always there for me, as I am for her. I support everything she does and everything she wants. I’ll rarely say no as I want her to be happy. But it’s always a no when it comes to me on issues she disagrees. When I do disagree with her, she gets upset but does  have reasonable reasons for it. But I just want to do something that I want to sometimes. It’s not something big like buying an extra house or car etc either.  I am beginning to just agree with her to prevent any further arguments.

2,"I am writing this because I have no idea how to tell it to you in person. Perhaps you might just skim thru this post and if so, so be it. 

I confessed to you last year and you rejected and the ensuing awkwardness started to kill our friendship. I assured you that everything was okay but it's quite obvious that our friendship is dying. We stopped voicecalling on discord and we rarely chatted except on a few rare occasions. I was at least glad to see that you were enjoying yourself but internally I was agonising deeply because I couldn't spend time with you. You promised to go to the arcade during the holidays and even watch a few movies but the promises were unkept. I was devastated because each day I looked forward to you inviting me out which never happened. Perhaps I wasn't as important a friend that I thought I was to you. I couldn't tell you these because it's just my anxiety and I shouldn't trouble you with these. 

Recently you asked why I was being weird towards you. I like you and I know that I can never be with you. I have no idea what to do in this situation. Every moves I make feel like a losing one. Maybe all these are just another case of me overthinking. I just don't know what to do.

3,"I too have the same dilemma with the poster of  #75148. I believe that NUS halls and residences need to be stricter regarding visitors in hostel rooms, especially that of the opposite gender. I personally have multiple cluster mates who bring in their girlfriend to their rooms regularly. The most egregious one of them is my direct neighbor and I can hear their voices and sounds very clearly from my room. As a healthy single male, I not only found this to be rather distracting, but only terribly aggravating! Here I am, trying to study hard and there they are in the room beside me, doing all sorts of nonsense that students of a supposed elite institution like ours should not be doing! I would like to report this issue but it seem very prevalent and the management is probably closing one eye about it. Something has to change!

5,"To be honest, it feels like I have come so far till the point now in NUS. Meaning I just feel like I am not as ""pure"" as before, and I have the tendency of wanting people to change perceptions of me.

Just a background of myself. I used to study overseas during my nursery and kindergarten, where English was not my first language. Only since primary school, I have always been studying in Singapore. As I was mostly home during those periods where my parents were working day in day out, I had never really socialise with other children. I did not even know how to communicate with them and not even knowing how to make friends. 

This got worse in primary school where i suffered bullying for about 3 years, where i had the naive thinking that if I was nice to anybody regardless bullies or not, they will appreciate me one day. But no, this never happened and school had been hell for me. They even criticised my looks and me being ""weird"". My mum found out one day that i was bullied and told me to be harsh if need be. I totally changed my attitude towards people, changed my looks by dressing more appropriately and etc and even focusing on building close connections. Of course in between I had experienced some ups and downs during my connection with people, such as betrayals and even those with toxic mentality. 

Thus I feel like I have changed in terms of how i interact with people. This is good for me personally as I have more people to communicate with and etc. But what I have noticed is, based on my past experience of making such connections, I just cannot help but have the tendency to always change myself(such as looks, personality and etc) as compared to how people usually view me. For example my secondary school friend had the thinking initially that I was always very quiet, not dressing up. But now in the same uni, she saw me and commented that I look and act totally different of how she viewed me initially. Even towards the bullies in the past, I kept making sure I look better and do much better than them even though i tried my best not to bother about them. However after meeting them, I then focus on how to make myself even better than before and change their perceptions for the better. In short, I seem to bother more about people's opinions and impressions of me, when I am trying my best to love myself by just being myself. Instead it feels quite pressurising at times having these tendencies. Sighs...

6,"As someone who graduated from university some years back, I can't stress enough the importance of having a good mentor. I wasn't from NUS, but my mentor was. You see, my mentor was the longtime CEO of the company I work in and he was a Jack Welch-type figure here. Suffice to say, many of our company's businesses were built up by him.

I was not his original protege. It was another person. Let's name him X. X was originally the COO to my mentor and was slated to take over when my mentor retires. However, X was caught dabbling in some backdoor transaction. My mentor then ousted X and made me his heir-apparent. After some time, my mentor retired and I took over as CEO. My time finally came, or so I thought.

Not long after I took over as CEO, X managed to return to the board of directors by convincing some shareholders to support him. However, I once again found X dabbling in yet another backdoor transaction, so I ousted him from the company again. I also tried to form some joint ventures with our smaller but more nimble competitor for synergies and got a foreign conglomerate to invest in our company. This must have incensed my mentor for he hated our smaller competitor. I am unsure how it happened but some company money somehow landed in my personal bank account. You don't look at the gift horse in the mouth, so I decided to spend the money to pamper my wife instead of on myself.

On the pretext that I somehow lined my pockets with company money, my mentor is now conspiring with X to oust me at the next shareholders' meeting. My wife is also not helping as she keeps wanting to advise me and repeatedly emphasises that I am the CEO with the power to snuff out this conspiracy asap. It's vexing and I now regret having treated my mentor with gratitude. To all you young ones, please open your eyes wide and clear when following someone as a mentor.

I don't suppose you students have an answer to corporate shenanigans, so I just need your help for a simpler question: my friend wants to buy either a yacht or a submarine as his latest toy. Which should he buy?

The study areas in Level 3 and 6 are closed for renovations, and the newly renovated level 5 is not enough to cater to the whole population of library goers.

9,"Does anyone else think it’s becoming more and more challenging to live and communicate with parents as one grows older?
I’ve been quarrelling a lot with my mother lately and it feels so emotionally draining. Probably a part of it is my problem as I’ve been facing a lot of stress at work lately and it’s affecting my mood when i’m at home with my family. But I guess she can be very unreasonable at times too. Let me give some examples to illustrate.
She’s a clean freak bordering on OCD. Every day when I come home from work, instead of asking about how my day went, she’ll nag about how my cleaning is not up to standard, things in my room are not where they’re supposed to be, some of my clothes not ironed immediately after washing, the floor is perpetually dusty...and many more of such trivial stuff. Well, I certainly would do a better job if I’m a full time housekeeper, but I’m not! It’s hard for me just to have peace and quiet after a long day at work.
She’s been a very authoritative parent since I was young and it doesn’t change now that I’m a working adult. She’ll dictate what time I should go to bed and wake up, take my meals and shower. And openly voice her displeasure if I don’t obey or try to reason with her. Sometimes she even makes comments about my outfit and won’t stop until I change to something she prefers. Aren’t all these too much now that I’m all grown up?
At home I totally have no privacy. She’ll open my cupboard and drawers as and when she pleases, and sometimes discards things that she deem not useful without asking for my permission. She’ll judge me on the stuff I have / bought (e.g “I found .... in your drawer, you bought yourself ah? Or someone gave you? Gosh, it’s so ugly.”). Don’t understand why she must do such things, sigh. 
The worst thing is that she nags at me endlessly for being single and not proactively looking for a bf. She’ll keep hinting at how many of her friends have become grandmas, and sometimes when she’s unwell or in bad mood she’ll loudly exclaim, “Aiya wanna die also cannot die in peace, my daughter still not married,” making me feel bad like I’m such a burden in her life :( Well, the reason I’m single now is that I used to get cheated on by my long term bf 2 yrs ago and I’m still living with the trauma until now, so I feel very deeply hurt when she says such things...
I do not despise my mother in any way, deep down I still love and respect her. Just that at times I got really frustrated and in desperate need for some space, autonomy and privacy now that I’m a working adult. And I wish she won’t keep forcing me to find a bf when I’m not ready.
Any suggestions on how to deal with such a parent will be much appreciated. Unfortunately moving out is not an option as I’m not earning much and don’t think I can afford the rent.

10,"I don’t need troll comments. Please. All I need is genuine advice. What should I do? 

I am really still a virgin girl. I sleep with teddy bears and dolls in my bed. I never got hugged to sleep. I never hugged a living,breathing human being to sleep. I never cuddled with anybody under a cosy blanket. My life is always super simple, I just go to school study, graduate, and work in an office (of course I’m not saying where I found employment as this is strictly anonymous) and I never check anyone’s text messages but my own. 

Is this why (not sure why, that’s why I’m asking, it’s open to discussion really!) I have “no feelings”? 

I feel nothing. Nothing! 

Other girls with sexual encounters already are extremely different from me. They naturally bawl their eyes out at sad romantic movies, while I can’t understand what romance is. They just feel touched enough to cry whenever something sad/moving happens between the man and woman on film. All these complex emotions.......while I’m trying my best to feel what it’s like to be even loved in the first place??? 

I watched as those with proper boyfriends check on their texts to make sure they aren’t cheating/texting their exes? But I don’t have a single shred of love in my life, so I don’t get why people can get so paranoid? Some even worry about their boyfriend not texting back in a minute (?!) and I’m like.....sometimes my sister doesn’t reply for the whole day and I’m like okay with it? 

But I don’t like myself this way. I desperately Want to change. I want to stop being someone with no feelings. I want to experience love too. 

I am on dating apps but no stranger ever asked me to even meet for a one night stand. I also go clubbing but Nobody asked me to go home with them after clubbing. 

Hypothetically speaking, if let’s say I begin to go on one night stands and actually have some form of skinship, I will also experience what love and romance are right? When it comes to songs and movies, will  I also feel so touched that I cry? 

I really never cried at a single song or movie before. What can I do about this?

11,"Its been 12 years since we first met. The first time I saw you, I froze for a few seconds just thinking of what an angel you were and how happy I would to just be your friend. You were absolutely perfect and honestly, out of my league. 

As months past, we got closer and began hanging out on our own. Somehow you started coming to my house and spending time with me despite your ridiculously tight schedule. I thought you were just fooling around and so I didn't put my all into it. I was always half hearted for I feared of getting myself burnt infront of a ""too good to be true"" perfect mate. 

I guess you grew tired of waiting and hinting, that over the years we each met our current partners. I told you I missed you then but I guess it was too late. It's been 4/3 years since each of us got married respectively but not a single day has passed for me without thinking of you. 

I love my current partner and am responsible for our marriage and will not do anything to jeopardize it, but my heart still yearns for you every day, every minute, uncontrollably. I hope you have found your 100% happiness with your partner and will never look back.

I was fine with us staying as friends without having any special or romantic relationships with you as I knew that I had never stood a chance to be with you. Yet you took advantage of me and played with my feelings. I fought for our relationship when things were not stable but you decided that everything was not worth it and that it's better to play around with others. You cheated on me before we even broke up. I wouldn't mind if we broke up and you find someone else right away since it would have nothing to do with me. But even if you were set to find another guy to play with, you could have waited till we broke up before you put it in my face that you have someone else in mind. 

Now we are just acquaintances but I hope that one day you would cherish the guy that loves you as much as you love him.

But about 1 year of frequent interaction with him, I’m starting to fall for him... falling really hard. He has not changed a bit in terms of physical appearance. But in my mind he just seems to be 100x more attractive than before. Everything about him just seems perfect suddenly that it doesn’t even make sense. I can’t function around him because of how attracted I am to him but I am quite sure he isn’t my type of handsome...

14,"Dear guy
We decided to end this relationship. No, i think u decided to end it before i did. It doesn't matter anymore. You gave up too early, way too early. That made me sad. I was ready to keep trying as long as you are sure about me. But i could feel that you wasn't. All those harsh words u said to me. I thought u were only joking and that u didn't meant it. Only now did i realise that you had wanted to end it long ago, but u continued because u feared that i would be sad, because you saw how happy i was. I had seen u being happy with me. Was that a lie?

Have you seen the effort i put in, to try make you happy? I buy small stuff for you to show my support as you get through the tough and long hours of work. If i could, i would have cook or made something for you. I try not to complain or show negativity because I know how draining it gets when one is tired. When you are sick, all i wanted is to see you to ensure you are really okay. How many times have i boarded the train to your station, only to turn back because I knew you wouldn't have wanted me to do so. I brought you to meet my friends because i want you to feel assured that i wanted a future with you. How i wished we had more chance to have double dates. I took time out to meet you even though i was so tired and not feeling well. How many times did i crash in my bed the moment i settled down at home and yet i sounded so energetic in my texts? How many times do you know i was unwell and stressing to get myself well again so that we could meet as agreed? How many times did i thank you because i was afraid you would think that I'm taking you for granted. 

But how many times did you appreciate what i did for you? How many times did you encourage me when i felt like giving up.

All these because I want you to feel loved. But I didn't know what i need to do to make you happy. So i tried every possible ways i could think of. 
How many times did i reach out to you to communicate with me. All you did was to crack some jokes or change the topic to ignore my question. How much i wish to know more of your world and what you have been through - the good the bad and the things you did - the good and the bad. 

We both lost in this relationship. We lost to communication. 

And then it came to me that the best way to make you happy is to end this, no matter how much i didn't want to. I need to set you free. 

Maybe you were also disappointed in me in some way. But that i will never know. I'm sorry. I love you.

17,"Sex before or after marriage, why does it even matter? 

If one takes a scroll through the comment sections of posts with the word “virgin” or “virginity” inside, the common consensus of those commenting are “its the 21st century why are you being so narrow minded”, or “go to IMH and seek help la”. The idea of pre-marital sex is oftentimes ridiculed on this platform, albeit sometimes there are neutral parties who rightfully so, asks the OP to “respect the partner’s wishes”.

Here is what i think about this issue, and if you frankly don’t care, feel free to scroll past this post. Firstly, I fully agree that virginity is a social construct, and deeming females as impure just because they engage in pre-marital sex is a ridiculous notion. However, I strongly believe that if someone wishes to date a virgin, or subscribe to the idea of post marital sex, their concerns and requirements should be seen as valid and acceptable, and not subject to ridicule as seen in the recent posts. 

As mentioned earlier, virginity is a social construct where our perspective on it is shaped by our education, experiences, peers, school, family and most importantly, oneself. So why are we trying to put people down with differing opinions and legitimate concerns? Why are we not more accepting of the differing ideas and moral values of other people? While i strongly disagree that pre-marital sex makes one impure or immoral, I find it shocking that people are labelling OP’s with differing opinions as “lonely and virgin forever”, or “crazy go to IMH la”.

And to those OP’s who are trying to convince their partners to change their mindset, please do so in a respectful manner. Like I have mentioned earlier, one’s perspective on virginity is based on a multitude of factors, and just because you are horny does not mean that she’s crazy or too strict. Please support your partner fully through this transition if that is really what you want, or respect each other’s wishes and wait.

Vegan options are few. Expensive/atas-looking options so many. I think I can speak for the majority of us when I say that we really dont need so many weird (or the other extreme: repetitive) concepts to open on campus. We need honest vendors who are good, reliable, and relatively affordable. 

The stalls and vendors who make it a point to price their food and drinks affordably are so underrated. Cheap and good needs to be appreciated so much more, and I genuinely hope they dont get a hard time from the school landlords.

Furthermore, some smart person decides that phd supervisor's approval is needed before one can bid for mods.

I feel like confessing here because the guilt is eating me alive every night. I can’t believe I did THAT to bring down my cohort peers. Please do not judge me; I’m really here to share my stories. So where should I begin? 

Last semester, I had four finals. I remember I studied till very late and I snack a lot. Like literally a lot. I swear I ate a house full of chips, cookies and some sugary candies. I was so hungry while studying in UTown. I stay in a hall by the way. So what happened was that I had a bad stomachache. I couldn’t unload my faeces naturally. It feels like entering the JB custom - always jammed. The night before my first paper, I did not shit. I hold my shit throughout the examination as I was so stressed and worried for my paper. I silently farted and I think it affected the people around me so badly that they were complaining to the invigilators. I even saw the guy beside me almost vomited by giving an awful expression. It hurts me so bad that my farts are making people around me uncomfortable. I tried my best to hold them but I couldn’t. I kept letting waves of smelly farts during the whole duration of the examination. As a result, some of the people around me did not complete their paper and submitted half-answered paper. I glanced and I saw. I was so remorseful about this. I observed the same trend for the other three papers. I told my best friend after this. She told me it was not my intention and I shouldn’t feel bad about it. As a shy girl always, I don’t know what to do. 

Although my stomach is feeling way better now after the exams, I’m fearful that the same shit will happen again in this new coming semester. I’ve two finals this time round though.

The real couple of those photo he use was literally in china the whole time in december, but he stole their photo and reposted it using the ‘girlfriend’ fb account to say she went paris leh! Paris in where? Singapore ah? Since he doing this kind of thing to himself probably at home in singapore. 

That day he also commented on a mothership post saying his gf pretty, i exposed him and ask him why he using other people photo and having literal split personality by replying to himself using two account, he straight delete comment bro. You all got any idea is who?? ;)

32,"Just want to rant a bit.

So I find it unsettling that companies are applauded for stopping to give away straws or plastic bags. I mean aren't they the ones benefitting the most out of this. 

First, I believe companies could reduce some cost from this campaign(I know the amount is insignificant but money is money). Second, they could gain some PR exposure out of this. I am not saying that I disagree with the campaign but they are the ones offering those things in the first place as some form of ""complimentary service"" to the customer, so technically omitting those ""complimentary service"" (and not giving away alternative in place of this) only benefit their side.

If these companies would say like they would donate the money that they could have used for getting those straws or plastic bag then that is something that could be applauded but I have never heard something like this before. So I guess the whole stuff more like PR campaign?

What are your thoughts?

She couldn't buy it for me because she rather spend the money on more useful stuff. I didn't get much toys when I was young either. I played with books that my Sister read. I only got two toys when I was young. A toy car and a mini cashier. I still had it till today. My army mates asked me about the stories of those Disney cartoons. I couldn't answer because my Mum didn't subscribe to any disney channels as I was not well to do. So I watch Channel 8 dramas and that was my childhood. They said I got no childhood, laughed at me for not knowing what they were talking about. I have childhood. My childhood was so much better than you. My dad brought my to fishing. My mum brought me for window shopping. My sister going on a breakfast with me on a Saturday. I am always rich, because I have my family constantly by my side.

39,"I have a problem with my girlfriend and am unsure whether to break up. See, we have been together for some time and it was rather smooth sailing. However lately, she started getting paranoid about lying after seeing some of her cousins’ relationships wrecked because of lying. She even demanded that whoever caught lying in our relationship will be fined by the other person. To reassure her, I agreed.

Then for some ridiculous reasons, she started fining me a few times for “lying”. The most ridiculous fine was when I blurted out during an argument that she spent more time meeting her good guy friends than meeting me. She said I was lying because I didn’t take into account the other time she spent thinking about me but choosing to compare only the time physically meeting. 

I was incensed and demanded that she give me a breakdown on how much time she spent thinking about her good guy friends compared to that spent thinking about me. At this point she said she can give me the breakdown, but she counter-questioned me about my intentions for asking and implied that I don’t trust her even though she always has my back blah blah blah. She still refuses to give the breakdown. 

Should I get out of this relationship? I know I probably still have value on the dating market because some other girl has persistently pursued me (but she has money management issues). But after all, my gf and I have been together for some time and we are familiar with each other. I would rate our rs as a 7/10, but her increasingly paranoid and controlling manner is making me reconsider. Should I break up with her?

41,"I see many people recommending volunteering to meet new people etc. But honestly I personally cannot fathom how people can like, voluntarily do volunteer work (if that makes sense), because my volunteering experience in school from CIP has totally made these activities feel repulsive. Being forced to go for these CIP activities and having a quota to reach is already bad enough, but what makes it worse is the actual volunteering experience. For example, in old folks' homes and nursing homes, you have to somehow interact with all these old and sick people; the extreme awkwardness is one thing, but another thing is that you know that their physical suffering is definitely not going to be reduced by simply having volunteers there and it just makes you feel so helpless. Then there's the kind of volunteering that is just saikang, like cleaning stuff and house painting. For house painting, I had a personal experience where the person whose house we were painting clearly wanted us to stop and kept telling us nicely that the painting looks ok and we have painted enough. It clearly feels like we are just wrecking her house and looking at our slipshod paint job (cos we aren't professional painters after all) only emphasises this feeling.

So I met this person T during one of the exchange briefings and we agreed to rent a house in Melbourne together. He wanted this expensive apartment with 1 big (1 double bed) and 1 small bedroom (1 single bed). I was a bit reluctant but agreed anyway. At first we agreed to split the money equally without deciding who stays in which room. However at the back of my head I was thinking about the difference in bedroom sizes as there’s a huge difference. 

So I decided to discuss with him about who stays in which room. He wanted the big bedroom but I told him we are paying the same amount and the one staying in the bigger room should pay more. He said that I’m calculative and taking advantage of him. Then I asked if he would be ok if I got the bigger room instead and paying the same amount. He begun to scold me about how he didn’t want to stay with me, I should be grateful to him, how we already agreed to pay the same amount etc (but not who stays in which room). 

In the end we settled for 52:48 with both of us being unhappy. So I have a feeling I will have a bad time during exchange staying with this psycho...

56,"Long post ahead. Just needed to rant and seek some advice.
I have this girlfriend clique from long ago. We’ve been together for more than a decade already.  I sincerely missed those days when all of us were still single ladies, where we would often arrange meetups for dinner and would treasure each others company. 

Now the problem comes when over the years, with each girlfriend finally finding a partner, I realised that all their attitude started to change. Now, don’t get me wrong, I am not jealous or anything, in fact I am truly happy for my friends who finally found a soulmate. From the bottom of my heart. Really. But what truly irks me is that the ones who are attached starts to slowly drift away from the clique, and often doing things that neglect the feelings of their girlfriends. Eg the clique has forever been planning to go for a short trip; to batam lets say, cos we havent had a chance to do so since we’ve been together. Then this one girlfriend can say “huh no $”, only to fly off to Japan with her boyfriend couple of months later. 

Then, there’s this other girlfriend. Before any of us dated, the clique has never emphasized so much on budget whenever we meet for dinner and to celebrate each others birthday. We just eat whatever we wanted to, cos what’s most important were the company we had back then. Now, whenever we do plan a dinner date/mini birthday celebration, people be like “budget please”.  Whats worse, when you see their insta story and they be like dining like queens with their boyfriends every other day (or sometimes every day). When its the clique’s turn to meet up once every 2/3 months, it becomes a budgeted affair. So now what, your decade long girlfriends become your budgeted friends already lah. Can eat good food with boyfriend all the time, but girlfriends not worth the time and penny to eat good food with?? Plus, we always plan a month or two ahead the birthday or dinner date, and people always gives excuses of being busy and all, it’s so darn hard to fix a date that everyone can make it. 

And then, every night (i swear) after work she’s having dinner with  her boyfriend  -.-  as seen from her insta story. THIS i cannot understand. 

To fellow girls, is this common in girl cliques or is it just mine. Why the need for double-standard, is it that difficult to prioritize both clique and boyfriend without upsetting either parties? Or is it that a decade long friendship means nothing to them anymore once they had a partner. Ain’t it like like burning bridges with friends who truly stood by their side since the beginning, long before that boyfriend of theirs existed??? To that, I always feel very sad and disappointed with these girlfriends. Is it right for me to go tell them out about their behaviour??

Regardless, she always faced difficult life challenges bravely and up till today I still look up to her so much because I don't know anyone else who is as strong as her. In the past, she never complains much, never whines about having to work night shifts to make financial ends meet. It was super difficult to see her in school, because she was always busy with work or had to stay at home to recover from her frequent sickness. Every time we meet up, she will always have a smile on her face as she gently encourage me to look on the brighter side whenever i rant to her about my trivial problems.

Needless to say, nearly everyone got laid off and him, being noble in his ways, was left last man standing in sg offices and revolted against his staff being laid off. As a result, he lost his job and decided to start his own venture. It has been almost 2 years since and he's gone ALL IN into his business, selling the properties, assets and whatnot. We were close to selling the fucking car this year. Why he lost all the money and hasn't made any back is a whole different fuckery for a diff time.

It's a very tough time for my family since obv we all depend on it. And when it comes to me, I'm still doing my bachelors and doing part-time gigs to make my walkaround money and it fucking enrages me to my bones that I'm unable to do much for his business financially. (He needs major funding obv). I help him out in my own little ways as much as I can (its a tech startup) and I have even offered to pitch to VCs for him but he's the kinda dad who trusts all over his own kin.

I'm always angry & aggressive, taking it out on other ppl and I'm worried I'll lose my shit soon.
I have tried just being into my own shit and letting him handle his business, but he's a noble man and a bad businessman. He's too nice and people including his employeed take advantage of him.

62,"Dear The Man

You saw my weakness and took my silence to your advantage. You viciously forced yourself on me. I remember those big hands of yours, groping my private parts and slipping your dirty hands into my panties. 

I cried hard and helplessly the first time. I hid myself. I called up someone. I couldn't talk. I could only sob. I hung up on them. 

It happened again. I tried avoiding you. You wouldn't stop. I wasn't brave enough to do or say anything immediately. I felt shame and fear. I had so much on my mind, so much reservations, concerns. I tolerated. I gave you the benefit of doubt. I talked with you, time and again. I tried rationalizing with you. I became numbed, then triggered. Now, I questioned my lack of rationality back then. 

Dear The Ones I Spoke Up To

One day, it broke. I broke. I said it out to someone else. I told you. That day, I regret the most. If only, I continued tolerating. If only if only. The hurt wouldn't be this deep, so deep now. 

I spoke up. I wasn't suicidal then, I was desperate for the wrongs to end. But now, I think, I may be so. Because of the aftermath, the re-traumatization, and the additional pain I could had avoided if I did not speak up. The look of disdain on the faces of those I so trusted to speak out to. The horror you put me through. Now, I wake up each day, dreadful, and pained. I go to sleep, wishing my eyes never open again. The nightmares are a constant struggle I fight against every night.

I felt my body was tainted. But now, I feel my body, my heart, my mind, my soul, my everything is way beyond just tainted. I feel inferior and small. I was exposed, I was put through re-humiliation by the ones I so trusted, I was lied to, I was betrayed, misunderstood, and abandoned. I tried forgetting. I couldn't. I tried to trust again. But I am so terrified. Could I ever trust again? Could I survive through this? 

I have been honest, and I will continue to be so. I wanted to live. I wanted to be a blessing. I wanted to survive through and to forge a future I envisioned for myself. But now, I want to give up. Purity is important to me. My body is no longer pure, my life is no longer pure. I no longer know what I am fighting for. My life? What about my life is worth living for now? 

My dear family

Sorry. I am sorry you did not know about all these that have been happening to me. Sorry that I did not share. I felt shame, I felt fear. I did not want to pain you with these, and all the more I do not want to do so now. Please understand me, why I am doing this. I want you to be happy. I know all parents want their children to be happy, too. I want you to know that, I am happy to be your daughter. Sorry that I did not show it enough. I have been drained. And sometimes, it's just hard to keep up with happiness. 

You saw through 20 over years of my life. You saw how hard I've fought for what I wanted. I was so bad in my studies I was mocked at when I was young. And so, I worked hard in my studies, for my grades, for the scholarships. I juggled my studies and work and tutoring. Once, I juggled multiple jobs in a single period. Tough, but you saw it, I never complained. And I genuinely was happy. I looked forward to meals with you. I wanted to see you smile, hear you laugh. I wanted you to be happy. I wanted a successful life, I wanted to be the daughter you could be proud of. I was proud of my achievements, and at the same time, cherished the simplicity of our lives. 

There were times I was down, times when I felt defeated and drained. But these were the moments when I bounced back up, higher. I had moments of sadness and failures, but I never let them keep me down for long. I knew what I wanted. I had my ambitions, my aspirations, my dreams and goals. I knew your expectations of me, and I knew the expectations I had for myself. 

However, this one setback has kept me down for way too long. You questioned, too. I've been doing a lot of things out of the norm recently, doing things for myself, things I normally don't. All just because I was fighting hard to keep my will to live. Fighting hard to see beyond the current suffering and pain, to see again the gift of life. But they aren't helping. And I know I can't sustain anymore. I know I can't spend anymore money on myself just to try to keep myself alive; our finances are tight. 

Now, I just want to be selfish. What will happen to you if I were to do what I want to do now? Probably heartbroken, and more traumatized than I ever am now. Will you understand me? Could I ever forgive myself? That plunge sometimes is so tempting. I just want to say that, please know that I love you, I really do. Sorry that I've never said it. 

My dear friends

If this gets posted, if you read this, and you are my friend, and if you suspect this to be me, please reach out to me. I yearned to have someone with me during this period of my life. I don't even know who I am addressing this to, because I have been so busy studying and working hard my life. I don't spend much time with anyone, other than my family. Do I really have friends, friends who will know this is me, and will be willing to reach out to me? I just know I don't want to be alone. It has been a way too lonely and frightening journey. 

Since that day, I only wish someone would hold my hands and walk me through the darkest days of my life, till I see light. But I am still struggling my way alone in this valley of darkness. Lost, drained, and hopeless. 

Dear Self

Sorry that I failed you this time.

1. I want to graduate with FCH => SU anything below A-
2. I want to graduate with at least 2nd upper => SU anything below B+

64,"Hi. I have been working for about 3 years after graduation, and I can really sense the growing generation gap in Singapore. You don't feel it much interacting in school, where we tend to respect and treat each other as equals. (Would suck if your circle of friends don't) But when you step into society, there are some really serious dysfunction in action.

(Disclaimer, I don't mean that all from the older generation are like that, but enough of them to ruin your experience in society and question your faith in humanity)

It begins with the parents. Asking for help with technology. At first, they seem reasonable and I don't mind helping. But then they start bugging you at the most inopportune moment, when you're writing an email, when you're are rushing for a work deadline. Followed by the ""I have raised you for 20 years, and you can't even help me with just this 1 small thing?"" Even though this is the 20th time I have guided them to download photos from their phone, or to escape the digital tv menu screen.

It doesn't get any better at work. How a finance/IT manager manage to even survive at their job without decent Excel skills elude me. How they just assume fresh grads would be better than them at Excel reeks of intentional helplessness. Especially when none of us ever learnt it in school. Fine, I get it that we're more IT savvy than the older generation. But darn it, this is your world too. Learn to explore it!

All this just erodes your willingness to help others. Because by rewarding such behaviour, they'll just bother you more frequently. Not only would you be giving yourself more work, you'll eventually be doing work that is rightfully theirs. At least this is still tolerable for those who appreciate your efforts, but...

Enter those senior members of the company/community who look down upon anyone of a lower position. They won't even bother to hide the disdain they feel towards you. The more discreet of them would spread gossip about you. But you may happen to encounter that self-respecting kind who would literally shove you aside to exert dominance or demand respect.

And it doesn't help that these people usually surround themselves with yesmen. Perhaps the long term results of the organisational structure or culture. The more benign ones would just close their eyes to abuse of authority, complicit in their silence. Then there are those who would take every opportunity to flaunt devotion to their superiors, treating any utterances as words of wisdom. And when you want to chime in to the conversation, they would tell you off for disrespecting your elders. 

Sigh... it is just so demoralising working with such people. I am truly sympathetic to the Ok Boomer movement.

65,"In modern days, majority of the people always enjoy what they are doing as they have the similar kind of feelings towards each other, be it songs, things, attitude, behavior etc. But what about the people who do things differently? These are the people who are labelled as weird, odd, negative, stupid, eye-sickening etc. Take myself as an example. 

I am a 19 years old guy, which falls under the “weird/minority” category. People rarely wants to make friends with me as I do not fall under the “majority” standards. Most of them treats me as the odd one out, a fellow where stuff that I do naturally is under bad and aggressive in their eyes. This is just one of the few reasons, there is a lot more which I am not going to list it down. 

Life is unfair for those that are categorized under “weird/minority” category. Majority of the people will strike us down if we wanted to do something like playing a heavy metal playlist. Most of them will just turn off your music and listen to theirs instead, but you have no choice but to give in to them just because that they fall under the majority category. Sometimes I wonder, why can’t the majority give in to the minority and let them do what they want for a few times. It might be good. Sometimes even majority can be bad, but they will just set it a side and if the same situation goes for the minorities, they get blamed, abused, ignored, laughed at. 

Let’s have a scenario. I was in a party of 12, they were playing music loudly. Initially a song of Nirvana came out, I told them not to skip it as I love these kinds of songs and it’s rare to hear it in a party too, Majority of them were like “stupid kind of taste, loud and aggressive music is bad, shit music”. And they just skipped the song and put up their own Electronic kinds of songs. Sadly, I couldn’t do anything about it because I’m always in the minority side of life. After the incident, I felt really left out and decided to go to a corner to enter my own world of fantasy as I know that no one is going to enjoy the stuff that I’m enjoying. Majority of them were really hyped and delighted with their music where as it is the opposite for me.

Sometimes we as the minority will feel that no one can understand us, hence this is where mental health starts to crumble. Depression and Anxiety will start to kick in. All we want is to be acknowledged by majority of the people, where people can acknowledge us and without being judged. For those who fall into the same category as me, which is under the minority, life is unfair for us, am I right? 

Of course, being treated this way improves our survival mental thinking, we are more independent than the majority as we minorities will feel ominous most of the time, hence building a wall and keeping everything to ourselves. Also, minority tend to be kinder as they must always give in to the majority and we are probably used to it, but kindness would have to draw a limit too to balance it out, if not, we are taken advantaged of basically.

For those who feel that you guys fall under minorities, you guys are real strong, I know that it will be tiring but we would have to fight on. And for the majorities, please give in to us sometimes. Would appreciate it a lot.

So I was dating this guy for a year before i got together with him that ended in a year. Throughout this period he kept cheating on me and lying. Had bad drinking habits behind my back and even girls/prostitution - found out by all these accidentally + after some FBI searching. So before we broke up, he actually cheated and disappeared. On one hand he kept apologizing and saying he dont wanna lose me. Yet on the other hand he's still out there telling everyone he's single for v long and playing with girls. 
So finally we broke up, and not long later he's attached to this girl, currently studying PMF. And this girl has a mixed vibes & looks of his previous 2 exes. 
We were introduced to each other's family and friends and all, which to me felt like it was good to go (p/s i found out the full truth only towards the end of the rls) but end up the joke's on me.

74,"hi, had to get this off my chest. I have been attached for 4 years in uni and i love my girlfriend dearly. As my girlfriend is quite sensitive, i have actively avoided interacting closely with any girls for the past 3 years. Add this with my 2 years of NS and its been 6 years since I actually talk or interact properly with any girls. 

Recently, I met a girl friend of mine one-on-one to pass her some lights that she told me she needed for Christmas. I offered to travel to her place since I was free that day. When I reached her place, she had made lunch for me and invited me to chill around. I found the gesture really sweet and at that moment, for the first time, I thought she looked really cute and sweet (I have no idea why I never noticed this despite knowing her for 7 years already). 

we had lunch and ice cream for desert (it was sorbet and i wasn't really a fan) and then we just sat on her sofa and chit chatted for around an hour. 
sorry to disappoint any readers but no we didn't do anything, but ever since that day which was around a week ago, I keep thinking about her even though I've been trying to block it out. 

I can't tell if this counts as cheating and if its because because I am very inexperienced with girls and fell into infatuation easily but I've been feeling really guilty to my girlfriend and trying to spend more time with her since its the holidays now as well. 

I've always despised cheaters but now i'm really afraid i am emotionally cheating, although I haven't texted the other girl since then. Does this count as emotional cheating? What do you guys advice I do?

He just like to let everyone breath in his smoke. I wonder if he's just extremely selfish or he's a sadist who wants everyone to suffer with him? The fact that my brother and I have childhood asthma didn't even budge him in stopping smoking in front of us. 
 
The worst part is that he's smoking contraband cigarettes which smells like poison. Life at home became hell ever since he started smoking contraband cigarettes from his room, with his windows closed, door opened, with his fan blowing the smoke out into the whole house. That time, I didn't have a room of my own and literally felt like dying whenever he snaps the lighter. During my A level year, it's just so depressing that after a hectic day, what welcomes you back home is the smell of smoke. Hence I dreaded going home and tried to stay in school until late night. 

He started smoking that trash since around 2015 and I wonder why the smuggler still hasn't been caught, even though I keep seeing news of contraband cigarettes being found at immigration customs. I actually tried filing a report in the SG customs app as a man used to come to our house regularly to sell those cigarettes wrapped in newspaper to my dad. However, I think my efforts were futile...

Now, I have my own room and can avoid the smoke more but the whole house is still smelly because of him, so I'm looking forward to moving out into my own house. Nonetheless, I'm still worried about my family's health since we are living in an environment like Indonesia with the forest fire... My mum and I wear a mask at home but my stubborn younger brother doesn't... 

TLTR: What can I do to get those illegal cigarettes smugglers caught? How do I get my dad stop smoking in front of everyone or even quit smoking?

80,"How do I deal with feeling that I'm never good enough?

I've always have this feeling that I'm underperforming, not good enough etc, even if the facts/my peers are telling me otherwise.

My peers are always telling me 
""Take a break, you've worked hard enough today.""
""You don't have to work constantly.""
""Rest, no need to be so stressed.""

But I just can't sit still when there's incomplete stuff to be done. I used to panic a lot before I submit my assignments, always paranoid that I might have made a huge mistake somewhere. 

It's not that I don't get validation for my work. I never scored less than a B+ for my tests and assignments. I have consistently maintained a 4.2-ish CAP for the past 4 years. During my internships, my coworkers and superiors have praised my work. But the thing is that I have somehow unintentionally conditioned myself to tune out these compliments/positive feedback. No matter how many times I receive the validation, it never ""calms"" me. I always feel like I'm not performing up to standards/expectations. I always feel like I'm below average. I can never list down my strengths and achievements easily, but have not problem listing down entire pages of my weaknesses and past mistakes. 

Right now, I have graduated. While attending a job interview a couple of weeks ago, the interviewers asked me to elaborate on my strengths, and I got totally stumped. Did manage to cook up something eventually, but I don't remember what I said, only that it wasn't completely coherent. To my surprise, I actually got the offer. Now that I'm 2 weeks into my first job, the paranoia is really driving me nuts. I am constantly worried about underperforming, and is seriously questioning why I got hired in the first place.  Even though it's not showing yet, I feel that it'll affect my performance in the long run.

This thing is hurting my interpersonal and romantic relationships as well. I was really close to this girl about a year back, and I'm very certain there's mutual attraction, and she's only waiting for me to pop the question/take action. However, at some point I started questioning what she saw in me, and feeling I'm not good enough for her. I started avoiding her even though she showed consistent concern and affection. Eventually I ghosted her and y'all can guess the rest.

How should I manage this paranoia? How do I effectively tell myself: ""Chill the fk out, you're doing fine.""? It's really driving me insane.

I ve been wanting to ask this for a while now.

Looking back on having taken CS1101S last sem, and now looking ahead towards taking 2030/2040 next sem, I feel that I did not really learn much actual programming from the CS1101S module. While we did cover some key ideas like abstraction and recursion, I feel that we did not really learn much from the module as a lot of the time was more so spent being thrown a new tool and then left to sink or swim, trying to complete the ""mission"". 

It honestly felt more like an exercise in getting the feel for a new tool, ie the runes missions, then the graph thing, each and every week rather than actually introducing us to new ways of problem solving, through manipulating the ways we interact with the input data to solve the problems.

Why not instead introduce us to the key ideas of computational problem solving skills and at the same time, the appropriate data structures to use to solve such problems instead of separating the two into different modules?

Thanks!

I've been told I look quite good so over the years I hooked up with a few pretty girls and we've been friends with benefits, meeting up every week or so. They are always so eager to show affection and to be honest I find them a little too clingy. I always treat them very well and since my family is pretty well-off, I pay for most of our outings and even the hotels when we didn't have any place.

Anyway, I try to show them that we are just casual friends (when they ask me about serious topics like what we are, I reply saying that we are still young and should discuss this in the future). But now, most of them are graduating and I feel like they are pressuring me to marry or propose to them. Two of them even asked me to meet their family during the next Chinese New Year and there's a real crazy one. Initially she started stalking me, but recently she even claimed that she's pregnant and wants me to go to the doctor with her. Obviously I ignored and blocked her number.

I'm genuinely perplexed, I understand that Chinese girls are more traditional in ""that"" aspect, but what are they even expecting from me?? To me it's just about mutual enjoyment, having a good time but apparently they don't feel the same way. I guess you can't even treat a girl nice without them catching some sort of feelings.

I'm not saying I am not open to a serious relationship, but I don't think they are worth spending more time on anymore.

I think I've seen a few similarish posts here so I'm writing here for advice too. We've been together for a while, soon to be two years, but I'm starting to take him seriously now and it kind of freaks me out that I don't really trust him and I feel like I should verbalize this to him but I'm not sure how I should do it. By not trusting him, I mean, I feel that he would be the kind of person who would abandon the family in time of need (e.g I get cancer! Our kids have ADHD! Or I lose my jobs ((I'm not working yet, still in uni but he is)). I also feel like he would be the kind of person who would leave the minute we have a major disagreement (everything has been smooth sailing so far, he's very chill and I'm very tolerant). I know it feels unfair to assume the worst of someone but how do I know that he's not going to flake out on me? We've been blessed enough to not be put through any major trials or tribulations but that does make me worry that he's not ""man enough"" to handle them when they inevitably come. 

He has this whole air of ""If you're not happy, leave."" Am I an asshole for feeling that he's not reliable at all?

A part of me feels that marrying a person like that is just asking for trouble even though he's been great in every other aspect so far - yet is asking for reassurance in this area bad? Even if I tell him this, what can he do to prove that he's going to stick around? Or what can I do to reassure myself?

Long rant ahead.. 

Story 1:

My bf (25y) and I (19y) have been together for close to 3 years. However, something that he have done recently made me doubt our rsl. 

One day when he came home from work he was 'not being the usual him' and was talking to me 'in a very nice way' (?) I knew him for 4 years so I could tell if he was hiding from me something/ did something guilty. Immediately i felt something was wrong. I know its wrong to check his phone without asking for his permission first but i just cant hold back my curiousness anymore. 

Long story short i checked his phone when he is not around and caught him sexting another gaming girl. My heart was literally aching and I teared up when I saw the conversation. Well based on the conversation on this gaming app i saw, he asked the girl for 'pics', but the girl apparently said she was too tired. The short conversation ended just right there, but before that there were afew phone calls made between them, so this could have happen long time ago without me knowing.

This has happened before, not sexting but cheesy way of talking to other girls online. Trust me, I have confronted him countless times and we 'had that talk before'. I ended up giving myself another chance/hope to forgive him and that it would not happen again. However, i thought that this has gone too far. 

I apologised to him first for looking at his phone without his permission, then confronted him about it and he said he was not hiding it from me (he had password on his phone and i unlocked it to check). He thought it was ok to sext with me knowing? He said he is not hiding anything as he said IT IS SIMILAR TO WATCHING P**N ONLINE ?!? LIKE HOW??! He said as long he's not showing any of his pictures to the other party it does not count as sext?!?! CAN SOMEONE PLEASE ENLIGHTEN ON THIS?!? Am i right or his right on this?!? Instead of showing any remorse, he kinda said that it is normal??!? to do it ??! Obviously i was pissed off and ignore him when he tried to coaxed me the entire night. He asked me if I still want him or not and I said Idk. 

Long story short, I still forgive him the next day because he promised me that he would not do it again. Am I being too nice to forgive him?  He cried and told me he would change and he wants to marry and have a family with me next time... we have spend so much time together and I do not want to leave him as well :( On the other hand, I kinda felt that I was being guilt trip to forgive him... 

Now Im lying on the bed while typing this, doubting my whole rsl with him every night, I am trying my best to trust him but I cry in bed silently at night with him beside me whenever I remembered what happen. I spend some nights at his house with him). I have never felt so self conscious and heart-broken after it happened :( 

Story 2: 

I guess many of you experienced the after-honeymoon period phase after a relationship. I felt like my relationship with him it getting more ""awkward"" as time passes by. We have lesser/nothing to talk about in real life/in text. Trust me I have suggested to go out to try new food/activities, but idk why but it just feels sooooo awkward to me. I feel like we are just sticking together just because we have no one else? I am feeling so tired in this relationship and i felt like we just so used to each other? Sometimes when i try to make conversations with him he just seems disinterested and gives me short reply. I love texting and I used to love texting him, ever since his reply have gotten cold, i have stopped. How i wish he would text me frequently :( 

Sigh I am getting so tired in this relationship, I have though of breaking up... I think me and him would be better off as friends? (I only have a few friends, and they are really busy with school/work, this is the reason why i was reluctant to break up with him, I was afraid to be alone). 

His family loves me so much, especially his mom who treats me so well, I can't bear to leave them :( 
To note, My bf does not mistreats me in anyway, he often buys me food i love and things i like for special occasions. I do the same to him too. 

Well I guess i will end my rant here.

99,"Hi, Im a introvert, nus first year. So basically I like to play video games I kinda nerdy and also happen to have a boyfriend but he gets jealous really easily.

So recently I started making bunch of new friends(mainly guys due to my nature) and I started hanging up with them in terms of like just play video games and chit chat.

So after awhile My boyfriend started getting so pissed because I started spending significant less time with him and he wants me to stop spending so much time with them. okay, fair, so I tried to squeeze some time for him and instead of playing with my friends and messaging them as often. I cut down a little and started to commit more and gave him a little bit more time but when I gave him more time he just wants even more. 

I just feel really stressed. Why can’t I just play with my friends more? Why can’t he be understanding? Sometime I just feel so controlled and stressful. 

Ik it’s unfair for him that I spend more time with other guys but it’s mainly messaging and sometime video games only and because of that.. sometime he asked what am I doing. I will just lied to him and say I’m doing nothing Or YouTube just because idw him to feel jealous. Am I wrong? What am I suppose to do?

104,"Sorry for the incoming rant but I have a few questions regarding the online-dating landscape in singapore. For some context, I'm a male NUS student and recently I've been trying out the online-dating apps since it is the holidays. As the matches come in, I observe that singaporean girls that use these apps don't seem to be interested in dating at all. They either lead you into a never ending session of small talk or they do not even intend on meeting anyone in real life. 

In terms of chatting online, most either give uninterested vibes/short replies (even when we are matched) or are somehow blind/unresponsive to my carefully crafted/decent open ended questions (not hard questions at all). When it comes to meeting up in real life, they simply refuse to do so (when the point of dating apps is to arrange a date to not only learn about the other person in real life but to see if there is chemistry).  

While I agree that my view is bias, especially after wasting days of small talk, I feel that I am not understanding something about singaporean girls. Do singaporean girls go on dating-apps to boost their ego or are they simply just a tough nut to crack? What are the usual norms in online dating? In the mean time, the only nut I can crack is my own.

TLDR: How to use online-dating apps?

It pains me even today because even today, against the advices of my close friends I'm still holding on to the memories and feelings. I'm choosing to hold them tight and alive even today because I just know that if I were to stop doing so, then none those moments that were shared, feelings that still burns would mean anything.

The past is not some worthless thing that is supposed to be trashed. It is a part of me. It is a part of our history. I'm somehow supposed to move on, that we're all suppose to move on when something didn't go right. Yet, precisely because time is a commodity, that every single moment in our life is so precious and worth preserving. And everyone that walked into our lives matter, especially, especially those that made your heart flutter because they are the ones that made you feel most alive.

109,"To #73876,

Sucks to be you then. Your crush not doing anything bad must have made it harder for you to move on. 

Similarly, I confessed to my ex-close friend about 2 months after she's got cheated on. Less than a month after her break up, we got into a few arguments (as friends). Mainly due to me advising against her going onto dating apps so soon. On hindsight, someone this emotionally unstable and unappreciative of friendship really didn't deserve any help (she'd blocked me for a week just because I advised her to read some r/s books instead of going onto dating app). 

But the main story of this confession was that she didn't just reject me. She discussed her decision, at length, with another friend in our clique. That friend, whom I don't converse more than 3 days worth of words in a year, took this whole event as a laughing stock. Worse still, 
on that day after she'd rejected me, she proceeded in and said something along the line that I should get my closure by asking about why I was rejected. So, we basically went by a few hours of walking with me explaining which qualities of hers that I had fallen for. 

Anyway, OP of 73876, just be thankful. This is how emotion abuse is like. Some people can really exploit you thoroughly, squeezing every patience and Goodwill out of you for her own 感觉自我良好. For ending, I removed her from every aspect of my life, physically/digitally/etc. Ain't no time for this kind of toxic in my life.

111,"I am, or rather was, close to one of my closest childhood friends, E, but her boyfriend was being unreasonably prejudiced towards me because he was under the notion that I was going to steal E from him, even though it was already well-established that I am gay . So, an incident broke the camel's back and nearly made E and I fall out, all because her boyfriend was being socially dense. Said boyfriend apologised for his actions in that incident but the apology sounded like ""I do not find myself in the wrong but I am apologising for the sake of apologising & E asked me to do so."" 
That attempt in apology diminished any form of reconciliation; I blue-ticked his apology. E also wanted me and her boyfriend to be netural towards each other. Furthermore, the friends in that circles also said that I should forgive him. 
I can't do it because the revelation of his prejudice and his apology was anything but sincere and thoughful. I felt hurt, knowing that I was treated differently from E's other friends since the very beginning and was uncertain if I should forgive him for the sake of the camaraderie of the social circle. Deciding to prioritise E's happiness in her marriage life over my decade-long friendship with her, I decided to avoid putting her in social situations where she had to choose between her boyfriend and me, because I knew she would be stressed having to pick between the both of us. However, that further strained the friendship and both of us were apparently suffering because she knew what I was doing about it, according to a friend. Said friend also said that the boyfriend ""wanted to make amends but OP was not letting him to."" It has been a year since the incident happened.
The question is: was I being unreasonable for not forgiving her boyfriend? Was I wrong to prioritize E's happiness with him over our decade-long friendship?

So basically last Saturday I went to confront one of the “guy friends” of hers which I assume he likes her. 
I’m unsure how to explain this but when u saw a guy you can just tell that he actually likes your girl as a friend or with motives just by the way he looks at her. You just can tell. (Victim herself probably couldn’t and keep coming up with lies and well idk or she just love the attention of guys.)

Anyway I confronted him despite my girlfriend previously keeps claiming they just “friends” and he have no motives. Guess what? I was right he told me in the face that he likes my girlfriend and his willing to break his current gf to be with her. YEAH break his “current gf” to be with “my gf.” I almost punch the guy in the face seriously cannot take this anymore.. but fine at least I have an answer now that I was right all the way.

Anw Sunday I manage to get my gf out for HTHT again but face to face this time round instead of calls or messages. And I told her all this so basically she was shocked as she doesn’t believe me because she think boy girl friendship exist. (Totally fine they do, just rarely or I think so)

Anyway after telling her all this she somehow still doubt me and think that I'm making it up.
So yeah I did what guys should do instead of continuing be in this pain I broke up with her. (Really wish I recorded the freaking convo to confront her making her speechless)

Well at least now i no longer have to suffer this pain of neglecting, under prioritised  and heartache.

Thanks y’all for support.

The weather is so cold in Singapore these few days, yet the water coolers around the school are still dispensing ice cold water. Isn’t this a blatant waste of electricity? We should just turn all the power sources off. Even better if it can be kept off till the end of next semester. And I haven’t got to the aircon being blasted at full speed in rooms where few students are using during this vacation.

NUS should implement a ""chickenisation"" programme. Give a chicken to every student at the start of next semester. Teach every student how to raise a chicken and learn about discipline. At the same time wean them off their mobile phone addiction. If our neighbouring country can do something like that to their fourth grade students, why can't we?

If uni life is too demanding to even maintain proper friendships, then what can be said when everyone goes on to work in the future. And this is not even counting how tough it is to make friends as it is. I'm feel like I'm putting in way more effort to keep in contact with people that I meet and get going with, to the extent that I'm the one starting every conversation (not too frequently so that it's not annoying). It wouldn't hurt to drop your friends a text once in a while to catch up would it? I've always prioritised friends over everything else, and would always go out of my way to make sure that the friendships last, such that even if there is an exam the next day, I'll set aside the day time for friends, and just not sleep in the night so that I can maintain both my studies and friendships.

119,"TL;DR: On exchange, friends take advantage of me and a few others because we choose peace over drama. Can't figure out if it is my problem or my friends are just being an ass. Would you all leave such toxicity behind and live your own life, or try to give in more even though you had tried your best to be understanding in unreasonable situations. Where is humanity? 

I am a NUS FASS student currently on exchange at the US with 12 other friends from NUS. A few friends of mine took advantage of me during this exchange trip because I tend to place others before myself. There are times I know two to three of them are taking advantage of me, yet I choose to not rebut just to maintain peace. However, I am beginning to burn out and feel that there is a problem with myself. 

When things need to be completed, I tend to be disciplined and stick to the timetable I have set for myself. Such as missing a few drinking sessions just to catch up on my work or apply for internships. Hence, this act of mine may be seen as ""not cool"". Also, ever since I got offered an internship position 2 months back, a close friend of mine who is on this exchange with me has been sarcastic and mean towards me. It just gets worse each day. 

Another guy A was discriminated by them due to the fact that they feel guy A is ""uninteresting"". However, this is really subjective and a few of us beg to differ.

Girl B then got ostracized after they feel that she is sensitive and uptight. 

Now, it is my turn because one of them made a false claim on me and I confronted her. In her defence, she said it was a 'joke'. However, how can someone be so petty over this small matter? Also, I thought we are all adult enough to talk it out. She refuses to speak to me and avoided me for weeks. 

It's always that few outspoken-extroverts that go on gossiping and ostracize people,  and the few intermediaries that choose to remain silent to maintain peace. Where is humanity? Why can't people just be kind?

Since this period it looks like she made some new friends from school to play with her and thats totally fine because making friends right?

But the issues is they hang out like almost every single day and since making “these few guy friends” our messages and convo dropped significantly and even when I’m back in Singapore she stopped hanging out with me. I trust her and I told her about how I don’t like that she prioritised her friends over me and I’m willing to make the effort to spent time with her. I’ve also told her that I have friends who are close with the guy and they claim that his flirty and clingy and always looking for target to work on. 

After telling her and we had many quarrels because she felt like I’m controlling her.. and she totally doesn’t believe me and she thinks I’m doing all this because Im jealous.. all I want is to spent some time with her.. am I wrong? It’s been about just over 5 months now, she still comes out with me once in awhile..

After I tendered, they became much more passive aggressive and insulting. I was given an ultimatum to complete a detailed list of all of my work within less than a day as I was informed at night and they wanted it the morning after. If not, they threatened to give me a bad reference to all my future employers. As I tendered right on the date where I’m able to get my bonus, they also told me that my bonus will decrease because of my departure. 

Is there anyone who has been through something similar and how did you deal with handling such unprofessional people? I’ve thought of going to MOM but that is more on wages rather than workplace harassment.

I, too, don't have too many date ideas, but I try to put in some effort to research places or think of things we could do together. After all, we only meet once, at most twice a week.

I don't ask for much, a simple gesture or text that shows he cares for me would make my day. Maybe the above examples seem small to y'all but I can't help but overthink that he's just not that into me.

We once talked about friends where one party appears to slowly put in less effort in the relationship and the other party got upset. He said that it was normal to put in less effort once a couple gets comfortable with each other. And I told him I totally disagree with that.

So boys and girls, please don't take your partner for granted! Make sure they know you still love and care for them. Something that seems trivial to you, could go a long way.

133,"You know, I really expected a lot better from USP. I'm posting here because I have no idea where I can go or who I can talk to without being blacklisted, but also because I can't seem to let this go and I'm hoping this rant would help bring about much needed change or if nothing else then I'm hoping it would at least help quench the fire in my heart.

I applied for a USP international programme. Suffice to say, I am a USP student. I was rejected for the programme obviously (else I probably wouldn't be here) but I got over that fairly quickly. What I couldn't get over was how the office dealt with applications and the attitude it was indicative of.

When you apply for, well, anything, you'd expect some kind of resolution, no? You either get what you're applying for or you don't, but you'd at least want some kind of information about the outcome. I didn't even get a rejection email. I had to go into EduRec wondering what happened to my application only to see that it was rejected. They couldn't even be bothered to send me a goddamn email much less come up with some bullshit excuse about the grounds for rejection. 

No interview, no nothing, just ""oh I hope you check a website you wouldn't normally be expected to check some time eventually"". Like, seriously? If that's how you wanted do it, then the least you could do is tell applicants that they have to check EduRec for the outcome after XXX date. You couldn't even do that. It's one line. Oh. My. God.

Students invest so much emotional energy with every application. Even goddamn Google and Facebook sends you a rejection email. It's not even about the content, you know more than half the time it's just the typical mumbo jumbo they send everyone else but AT LEAST THEY CARE ENOUGH.

It's bad enough having to deal with the constant imposter syndrome, on top of that you throw in having to deal with this ridiculous attitude. Amazing. I don't even care what happens now because I'm never applying for another international programme with USP but I hope the office starts learning that students have feelings too and that what is going on SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING.

Thanks for tuning in to my ted talk. Bye.

134,"So i have this friend and we have been friends for around 2 years. We’re pretty close since she’s open and tells me everything. Not only me, anyone that comes into her life, she shares everything. At the smoking corner, she talks openly about what song she and her ex listens to when they have sex even though they have broken up. 

So both of us smoke but i have since quit. She constantly posts videos of her smoking at home and idk for what reason. Its just her blowing smoke at the screen. She has many partners that she has slept with and tells everyone on her spam what they do through her daily “vlogs”. Another thing she does in constantly post and tell people she is on antidepressants and she is depressed. She also takes pics of her pills. (Do people really do that? Like show off they are depressed to get sympathy points?). She always posts herself in bra and panties on instagram, full body ones. Also changes boyfriend all the time. 

My question is, is she really doing all these for attention? I know many people who have said that and i do feel it is, like a little bit. And the bf thing, why does she keep changing bf so easily when she keeps getting hurt after that? Do any girls or guys act like this and what are your reasons for doing so?

Every holiday (like now), I'll stay at home and watch my kpop stuff most of the time. As my family doesn't travel overseas for holiday, I can only holiday in SG. The sad thing is that I can't seem to find any friends to go out with during this period. In the past, my younger brother would go out and play with me but now that he's older, he doesn't want to do that anymore. So I just hide in my room and be sad :< In NUS I have some friends to talk with, go for lecture and stuff but they don't tend to hang out with me too.

I know I'm being a hypocrite to rant about this here but I honestly cannnot do this to her or she will get sad and feel that she is a always bothering me (ever since I knew her, I know that she is very senstive). Like for instance, we were in a clique with 2 other girls back in JC but she had a beef with girl A. Although they have been on good terms after that small misunderstanding they had in JC, they weren't texting and meeting up as often as back then. So on Friday, this friend of mine asked if girl A said anything about her. And I was like, ""no, why?"" I mean she have better things to do since she is quite bz with her current life. And today (11/12) she suddenly texted me about that question, which I'd already forgotten about, mentioning that she only asked out of her insecurities, incase I get the wrong idea that both of them are having a conflict again. 

Honestly, I don't get why she have to ask me this question repeatedly. It isn't the first time she's doing this. I mean people aka girl A have better things to do what, it's not like she whole day nothing better to do but bitch about you or what right. And she (girl A) is also not thay kind of person (also anoyher genuine friend of mine). And I find it very tiring to always reassure her that it's fine, and that I understand where she is coming from. Because everytime she clarifies things with me, she will send me a whole paragraph and honestly, I'm a lazy ass so today, I was fking lazy to reply shit, but I had to, so I simply sent an, ""ok,"" and a sticker right after. 

Sorry for the rant, but I really can't do it anywhere else. She is my close friend and one that I treasure alot, but it's just her insecurities really make me pekcek.

144,"For this story,i ll be using the name Jane Doe to conceal the girl identity in the story.

I met jane doe in cs1010s during y1s1 for one of the supplementary classes as we were struggle for one of the assignment and needed help. Jane and i exchange no so that we can discuss on future assignments for this mod as it was hard... we grow close together partly cause we suffered through this mod together.  she was lovable and cute.. kept calling me her senpai and it feels good for someone smart and pretty as her to call me that. and i did help her alot for cs1010s in sem1 and ger in sem2... and gotten quite close to her.  she is also supportive and encouraging of me to keep doing my best in my studies.

Fast forward y2s1 where the problems begin. We had our fair share of bad group mates in the mods we took. So i decided to group with jane doe and 2 of my good friends for this mod called ges1021. The first few weeks. She seemed like a nice and sweet girl.. and she and my friends got along fine. BUT she began showing signs that she might like me. Like playfully poking me and leaning on my shoulder from time to time and i was atttacted to her because she a pretty girl with a  sweet and kind deposition. Since we were expected to make our own notes for ges1021, she started to rely on my notes and that where things went sour.

Six strikes too many.  Firstly, Jane Doe began acting strangely during SEP application week. Jane Doe disappeared on our group when we need to decide places to go . But you re werent there and ignored me texting you 5-6 times whether she like to go a place near her house for convenience. But Jane Doe told us that she were busy with cca and sep and couldnt even bother to come to a non webcast lecture. Secondly, Jane Doe didnt bother to study for the mod you choose and complain how my notes are unclear for you to understand and decide to text me 100 qn to prepare for your midterms. I helped cause im afraid you were lagging too behind. Thirdly, you demanded me to restructure the notes i send her and even ask me to highlight in red the comments the prof stress on... but i was too blind to see and i thought is normal to help a girl you adore so much.

Fourthly, when the ges1021 prof said we had to change the location used for our project Jane Doe was furious. I get that. But the moment Jane Doe acted like she knew better than the prof  that where i draw the line. Cause no matter how smart you are is pretty arrogant thinking you re better than her right? Fifthly, closer to the deadline i get that you re stress with your competition coming and your geh midterms incoming. But you didnt have to show poor attitude by being all sarcastic about losing a few marks for not using apa format when you just want me to do the work or how you used me to do the work needed to be done when you could have asked the group. We re in this together but Jane Doe seemed to look out for herself and pretend to contribute significantly. when the rest of the group done significantly more work than whay you did. And lastly, you told me to make use of my ue as mod that can help me in the future. When i planed my sep outline with her advice in mind hoping Jane Doe would be happy for me. But she just ignored me.. like im only worth a damn when you needed my notes which you are expected to craft yourself and that the final straw cause at that point im just exhausted and just gave up on her. 

Am i crazy?
The whole sem i try and try to chase her and extend my hand to jane doe. But it seem she only interested and exploting me cause im just too gullible. I thought is normal for a guy to chase after a girl. And i must be crazy for not thinking she cant be in the wrong and that she still a good person. But she had me wrapped round her finger for her use. But thanks to my friends who at least let me see reason i decided to block her on whatsapp cause the girl i know no longer there and there no point keeping in contact with somebody who only want my notes..

So to Jane Doe, you really played me like a fiddle. And the kind-hearted girl i know before me is dead in my eyes. You probably wont change.. but at the very least from the experience i learn that you should have the strength and courage to walk out from any toxic relationship with anyone who just out there to exploit.. it is hard but a necessary evil.. that you have to take for your own good.

Almost all of my friends are guys and sometimes I wondered is it because of my guy friends that potential suiters backed away. Most of the time its other people (not my friends) who asked if xxx or yyy is my boyfriend, though they are not. It makes me feel like cutting them out of my life.

Nobody have ever confessed to me, and my guy friends either say they never wanted to get married, see me as a bro or that they don't wish to lose our friendship because I'm the nicest female friend they had, plus I always give really good advice.

Sometimes I wish that maybe someone, among my guy friends had actually liked me a bit since they can be really nice to me like (all 1 to 1) volunteer to drive me to and fro from home to a destination because I had too much things to carry, invite me to his house and cooked a really nice dinner, walk me home when it is very late, treat me a small meal here and there.

No skin-ship was involved in any of the activities and they didn't even stand close to me so no flirting was involved also. Without me saying anything they will sometimes reject me directly like calling me bro or reiterate our strong friendship. It makes me feel kind of sad sometimes.

Maybe I'm just chasing something that doesn't exists. And I should appreciate the friendships that I have. Sigh.

147,"Hi all, just need to rant and maybe seek some advice here. I've been in a 3 years relationship with my girlfriend. I'm 22 and she's 21. She is the sweetest, most attractive and most genuine woman I've known, but this statement is only applicable when she is in a good mood. Recently, we've been in a series of arguement and she is currently giving me the cold shoulders, on and off. For instance, last week, she desperately wanted to have her milo dinosaur, but since she was down with the flu, I stopped her and gave her warm water instead. She got pissed and stopped eating and simply watched me eat instead. The next day, she was back to her normal self again.

However, few days later, we argued again about cleaning her room. We have been living together for 2 months, with a maid, in another apartment, owned by her parents. Usually the maid will do the chores but she is on leave for 3 weeks due to some family issues at her hometown, so naturally, we had to do the chores. I started to tidy her room, including the wardrobe, toilet and her makeup table for her as it is in a mess, and vacuum it right after, but she got irritated, and questioned the purpose of arranging stuff when it's gonna be messy later on. Okay, I admit, I'm a clean freak so I cannot stand how messy things are. So, she got angry, and I've got chased out of her room since then. She doesn't even want to talk to me now and have been out with her girlfriends everyday to avoid me.

Yesterday night, after she got back home, I tried talking to her since I feel that things need to be fixed in this relationship. Although she was playing games on her phone and acted like she wasn't listening, I know she was. But she simply didn't want to contribute anything to the 'discussion'. I'm at wits end. I still love her, I'm willing to do the chores for her too but I feel like this relationship is reaching it's end after this fight. Love experts, help me, how can I make her things better. Please don't advice me to break up, because it won't be an option, unless she sincerely wants to.

She also said “ I am saying your whole class........ doesn’t likes u ..Except for the Show off but humble girl likes u only”.  Came to me to tell me the whole class not liking me but In the end , refuse to tell me the reason no matter how many times I ask.

I’m an only child too. Worse still, my dad stayed with his parents and unmarried sibling, and they expect me to be a surrogate child and provide for them.

My grandma has 6 kids and 10 grandchildren, but I’m the only one to bring her for medical appointments. My uncle used to take care of her needs until he fell ill himself. They now expect me to move back to take care of the 5 old folks at home, and bring them to the doctor. 

I had to draw my boundaries clearly and refuse, knowing that all the financial burden and time spent on medical appts (we’re talking about 1-2 appts weekly) would be foisted to me by all the cousins. I don’t understand why dad’s unmarried siblings would expect me to pay and spend most of my annual leave ferrying then to the drs when my cousins drive and are earning so much more(close to or over 5 digits for half the cousins), and they knew I used up all my leave on part time studies. 

Some welfare group has been by and offered them aid too. They rejected and said relatives would help, then promptly called me and demanded that I buy or rent the required items for them. Not sure if its their pride, but I sure wish they would distribute the burden out more evenly. They would tell me there is nobody else, but when I insisted on not having any leave, they managed to find another cousin who brought him to the doctor.

165,"There are many people talking about how they don't have close friends in life, about how hard it is to make friends in uni. Many people have said that it is part of adult life that friends come and go and they just have to get used to it. I disagree. 

My grandmother passed away recently, and at her wake many of her friends whom she knew for decades came forward and shared how they were thankful for all that my grandmother did for them. They recounted how she went to care for them after they had surgery, how she said encouraging words to them at their lowest point when people were criticising them, and how much they would miss the joy she brought to others. My grandmother is my role model in what it means to love my friends. 

So when a friend in school told me she changed friends whenever she entered a new phase of life because it's part of ""adulting"", I was alarmed, because I feel that is degrading the precious value of friendship. Nowadays a girl and a guy can meet in uni and then when one of them confesses after less than a month the other says, ""Sigh, you mean alot to me, and I really wanted to keep this friendship."" In my mind I'm thinking, what friendship? They barely know each other...? 

Friendship goes beyond companionship, it is a tried and tested bond that stands the tests of time and circumstance. I myself am lucky to have close friends that I have known for over 10 years. I know they will be in my life for a long time because my friendship with them is not seasonal. Sometimes I really hate my friends for the things they do or the hurt they cause me. But I realised that friendship works like this: I like my friends for some of their characteristics, but I love them despite some of their characteristics. They are in my life because both sides invest in the friendship, and continuously care, love and forgive. 

So to all those out there who feel empty because they don't have a friend that stays, don't let others tell you that it's reality. To experience friendship that lasts a lifetime is possible and beautiful. Keep trying because from my grandmother's life I know it is possible :)

Like honestly almost every other mod at least allows us cheatsheets minimally (CS2030 doesn't), but we are also expected to code out on examplify (goodluck with formatting) with APIs we are supposed to be ""familiar with"" not being provided.

It's not like we are just taking one mod and to expect us to be able to be prepared is insane.

We constantly compare ourselves to others-- we have to copy what other people are doing so that we don't lag behind, without thinking if what others are doing is actually meaningful. We work our entire lives to attain superficial status symbols -- money, cars, branded goods, etc. without asking ourselves if those material objects actually make us happy. We never give thanks when things go well but when other people don't live up to our expectations we never hesitate to make our voices heard. People complain 24/7. Ironically, our egos are so fragile even the most constructive criticism is seen as an affront to our dignity. Honestly, coming back to sg and being surrounded by negativity makes me feel so suffocated every day. Going overseas has also made me realise that Singapore is a really nice country -- safe streets, good food, great infrastructure etc.  I just wish people would learn to be happy.

Then at the bench rack I saw this average looking guy with weightlifting shoes, and I was amazed by the amount of weight on the bar given his physique and size. I asked if we could share and he looked at me for awhile before grunting and nodding impatiently. As I was removing the plates I felt a bit embarrassed but it was my usual routine so I didn’t want to start my workout with other exercises. When it was his turn I helped him to put all the plates back in, which was super heavy for me, as he was putting the plates he was quite disgruntled and kept mumbling impatiently. I felt paiseh at that moment. 

And then, He. Started. Quarter. Repping. Moving like less than an inch. Afterwards slamming the bar back onto the rack. 

On one hand, I was relieved that I wasn’t hindering a serious lifter’s progress. On the other hand, why did he behave in such a rude manner when he was not a pro from the start? Most people at the school gym that I’ve seen are rather humble.

181,"Interracial couple here grappling with the issue of allowance for parents.

To give some background, my parents earned $3k plus combined when I was growing up. They were great at saving up and investing which meant that they were able to retire without expecting anything from me. My family has led a very simple life up to this point (few overseas holidays over many years, home cooked meals most of the time and I gave my parents everything I earned from army and from the part-time jobs I did while schooling) which is the reason for this situation. My girlfriend's parents earned $7k plus combined but have very little savings due to their lavish lifestyle (yearly travels which costs on avg thousands per trip). If it wasn't for CPF, we would probably be stuck financing their golden years (thank you CPF!).

These days, my gf's mum constantly reminds her that her allowance is due. My gf and I scrimp and save for our wedding, housing and renovation so it pains us to see her mum spend money like water. 

The sharp contrast between my parents and her's has made it such that we will end up giving the allowance to her parents begrudgingly. I really dislike this treatment of my girlfriend as an investment.

My idea of filial piety is spending time with my parents, buying things which I know they have a fondness for and also making sure they're healthy and that their needs are met. 

I wish more families had the mindset of paying it forward. I will support my kids, the same way my parents had, and expect nothing in return other than love and affection. This current situation of ""I raised you so you owe me"" has made it unpleasant for alot of young folks. As one of insurance ads said, we will be the last sandwiched generation. Haha

182,"This is in response to #73374 and #73368.

Local born Singaporean here. Just wanted to provide you with some local context. In the previous generation and the generations before that children were seen as assets that made money for the family. So poor families would have many children, some more than 10 kids, so that these kids would faster work and make money for the family.

So let's not sugar coat here. To the older generation kids are assets and money-making tools. Modern day slaves. You can say how there is ""filial piety"", or how we should be grateful for our parents.

I call bullsh!t. This is simple Confucian brainwashing about how the young must bow down and be subservient to the old. This is why you see so many older aunties cutting queue to the bus or food stall. They think they can do whatever they want and its indoctrinated.

To those that say the parents spent all their money on you and you should be grateful - I never asked to be born, and if my life is miserable are my parents going to pay me compensation?

Parents have kids for purely selfish reasons. How your life turns out is the roll of the dice.

If your parents are poor and asking for allowance - adults have the responsibility to ensure that they are able to have enough money for retirement if they are going to have kids. Kids are not cash cows. No money don't have kids.

If your parents are rich and asking for allowance - you are just another regular money bearing asset for them to pad their income. Parents who are rich and don't need any allowance but still insist purely because of the aforesaid Confucian brainwashing.

Children happily do so out of stupidity. Want to be grateful to your parents? There are a million things you can do for them. But giving money to rich retirees is the stupidest thing ever. 

I even read someone saying they ""agreed"" with their parents to give 25% of their income. I congratulate the parents for one of their best investments ever with the highest ROI. Just need 10 kids and their income would be in the top 1%.

It's quite upsetting to see people with a different cultural context and simply respond with ""oh that must mean they are ungrateful"". In my country, staying with your parents after you have started work is quite frowned upon and people perceive you to be leeching off them despite having your own money, but in Singapore it seems like that is quite common too, so it's just different lah.

My girlfriend and I graduated and are working in the accounting industry hitting about combine 7k, we still get put off by the BTO costs. Just the recent BTO 4/5 rooms flats comes to about 400-500k. Thats half a million and way out of ordinary Singaporean's reach.

We also feel slightly inferior as most of my classmates are making easily 4-5k one year adjusted. How to survive in Singapore??

And no, we are not spent thrifts, we give our parents 400 a month, utilities 100 , food 1000 (approx 30 dollars a day), transport 150, passive investments 200, uni loans 500 (35k). Checking accounts leave with about 500-700 dollars each month. Anyth leftover from overbudgeted food goes to savings account too.

We eat out only on the weekends and minimal entertainment or drinking. Weekend travels even to neighbouring countries are out of the question at the moment.

The only saving grace is that we have no plans for kids. This is the reality of Singaporean uni grads. Sometimes I envy my classmates in the banking/cs/consulting sector making 5k easily.

Coincidentally, it's my 21st birthday today and we were supposed to spend the evening together. He even booked the restaurant 2 weeks in advance and I've rearranged the celebration with my girlfriends because of the dinner date. However, during my afternoon lecture, I received a message from him stating that he will be sleeping in and the date will be cancelled as he is quite tired. After reading the message, I simply blueticked him as I was rather disappointed and upset, but also hoped that it was part of a surprise he planned so I couldn't even concentrate during my lecture. However, as time passed, I began to believe that he really stood me up. I understand that he is exhausted from the trip, but who doesn't want to feel special on your birthday, especially on your 21st? Furthermore, I haven't even seen him for the whole day. Or am I just being too princessy like how guys always categorise SG girls?

I'm trying to convince myself that a birthday celebration wouldn't be as important as long as he loves me and treats me like a special someone every other day but I just can't seem to be happy, or maybe at least not upset.

Don’t know any other platform to put my thoughts into words, so here I am. Sorry!
 
I personally don’t understand why ending of relationships must be so painful to either individuals. Painful in terms of the hurt, sadness, anger etc.

I honestly thought, loving someone is hoping for the best for the other person. Which also means respecting whatever decisions the other party make, because they definitely made the decision with the belief that it would make themselves happy. 

If he/she decides to break-up, then it’s a decision they believe will make themselves happy. Shouldn’t we (the other half of that relationship) respect their decision if you truly do love them?  

If one cannot come to terms with it, I Guess it’s more of “wanting the person to by their side”, which seems to be fulfilling your own personal need/want (depends). For this group of people, I truly belief they have no idea what. “Love” is. 

But conversely, from the perspective on the other side, why would you want to break up if you believe the other party won’t be happy? It sure is complicated. 

Just my thoughts because i think many people have lost the meaning of love. But what do I know, I’ve always been a single guy my whole life. Hahaha.

208,"Could someone share why some lectures, which are held in LT with webcasting equipment, are not webcasted? Firstly, this is underutilising equipment which the school has bought. Secondly, if the lecturer speaks too quickly or the content is too complicated, watching webcast helps students who are slower in absorbing information. Thirdly, should students have any doubt, they could check the webcast before asking the lecturers, thus saving time on both side (the student does not need to wait for the lecture’s reply). 
If the lecturers feel that students would not be consistent if there are webcast, there are work around such as releasing webcast for 1 week only. However, as students are mostly above 18, they should be sensible enough to not need someone to check up on them if they are consistent or not. The stupidest reason I have heard so far is that he (the lecturer) will be talking to an empty LT. The question I would than have is what difference would that make to him? He still gets paid the same amount and students still can learn from him through the webcast. Or is the reason because the lecturer teaches very poorly and doesn’t want concrete evidence on this?
Could NUS do something about this if there is no legitimate reason for not webcasting?

215,"I really envy other girls who receive flowers. I am average looking with some bitch resting face, and have dated before. I already in my late twenties but the only times I receive flowers was when my boss asked the admin to send me a large set of flowers to my grandpa’s funeral and when I performed on stage in secondary school. In my last serious relationship, I hinted to my bf that I wanted flowers but during one karaoke session a few weeks before we broke up, he even had the cheek to sing “When I was your man” into my face. (Think the first line of the chorus). 

I wanted flowers so much that sometimes I think, whoever is the first guy who gives me even one stalk of flower for romantic reasons, I will secretly decide to marry him if he wants to marry me in the future and if he’s not a jerk. I know it’s silly, but that’s how much it somehow irrationally meant to me. I confided about this to a friend and she asked why flowers, why not chocolate why not anything else. I think, it’s probably the meaning of the validation that comes with it - that flowers are pretty, that if someone is willing to spend the money to buy something expensive that last only a few days, you must be worth it in his eyes. I mean, after working, I have the financial ability to buy myself a whole room of flowers if that’s all I want. I also can ask directly for flowers in my next relationship, but it’s just not the same. 

Well, I guess I am really literally 花痴, haha.

I'm not sure if you know this, but as profound of a thinker as he was, Socrates was a little obscene with his language. I'm guiding my finger over each page, waiting for God to catatonically stop it over a particular phrase that I should be paying attention to. My finger grazes back and forth through a certain page like I'm reading braille when a passage jumps out at me.

Γαμώτο σου. Πιέστε καλύτερα τέσσερις πέντε έξι επτά οκτώ οκτώ κάτω από το λαιμό σας. Δεν υπάρχουν τέσσερις διαφάνειες ανά σελίδα αλλά μία.

I know nothing about ancient Greek, but with the aid of a translator on Google, I received my testaments.

Screw you nerdhead. You better shove lectures four five six seven eight down your throat. Not four slides per page but one.

Coarsely put, Socrates. Even in 450 BC, this mofo knew what was up.

My past revisions meant shit. Im screwed. From 11 PM, the start of lecture four, all the way until 3 AM, when the slide of the final lecture concludes, my ass will be clamped shut, sitting in the middle of my living room in the lotus position. My mom will be ignored. My dad will be ignored. My bodily functions will be ignored. I'm not giving a hoot until I finish eating.

So she decided to break up with me, despite me fighting hard to keep the RS going.
I'm still slowly trying to come to terms with this, and just need a space to let it out I guess.

My heart hurts. I loved you with everything, and tried to make life happier for you. I always told myself that I had to make you smile no matter what, when you were having one of those depresso moments. And i did. It always made me smile too.

I know you find it hard to deal with the fact that life together in the future is highly unlikely due to your condition, and also the more pressing factor of our families being of different religious backgrounds/race.

But I still love you, and you still love me. It hurts me to see that you've given up when I'm still fighting. But then again, I'm happy when you're happy. And I can understand why it might be easier for you to give up. It pains me to know that i can't be the person to comfort you whenever you feel down. It hurts me to know that we can't ever share the happiest experiences together again.

I cry whenever I see our photos together, when you and me were laughing and smiling. Why does life have to be so hard on interfaith/racial relationships when it comes to family? The depression just stacks on.

I can't find it in myself to give up on you. I don't know how to give up on you. I know you're still undecided on whether or not we could get back together as a couple because we still love each other, but you feel it's easier for you to break it off for now.
You cry whenever you see me cry, so I try to hide the sadness.

Still trying to find a way to get past this pain

It's one thing to test concepts slightly beyond what was taught in the lecture. If I can't get the answers, maybe I just don't understand it well enough. That's a ""me"" problem.  

But it's another thing to:
1. Cancel a lecture 1 hour before the lecture timing and post it on LumiNUS without any announcement  
2. Not upload the slides until 7 days later  
3. After the slides are uploaded, took another 3 days for the pre-recorded lecture to be up  
4. After the lecture is up, took another 2-3 days to gain access to view it (cos it was restricted)
5. Turns out the lecture that I waited 1.5 weeks to watch, did not cover all the content of the last lecture, and had unbearably soft audio.  

The content was tested. No explanation on why everything was so late. No response to email. How is that acceptable?!

I had taken on a leadership position in my school's choir, which required me to lead an acapella ensemble in the national anthem from time to time. The intense choir practice schedules left me with a damaged vocal chord, so I started asking other leaders to assume the role of leading the acapella choir instead. Despite explaining to others about my current vocal condition, they were quick to criticize that I had instead tried to push responsibilities away. Over time, I fell into depression and once broke down in front of the choir. One of the members took my situation onto social media and mocked me for that. I nearly ended my life that day.

Looking back now, I wished I did not take other's opinions of me to heart, but I was merely 17 years old and did not know how to process such a situation. I wish people could be kinder and more supportive, and not make nasty comments and assumptions about things that they do not understand.

232,"I don't know what to do with my life. The post will be long, and please bear with me.

I have always been considered 'dumb' in Singapore's eyes. 

For PSLE, I was in the NA stream because my grades were horrible. Since then, my parents have always been disappointed in me because my brother was in the Express Stream.

Fast forward to N level, I got pretty good marks (13 points), but I could not make the cut of 12 points for the Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP). I could only go to Higher Nitec (ITE), but my mother was against it as she said that I would forever have a black mark on my education because I went to *ITE* (Boomer logic lol)

So she forced me to go for O level, where I failed badly, I got 32 points, and my Math was ungraded. I have always struggled with math, Chinese, and science. 

Even though my other subjects like humanities, English/Geography/Literature have always been in the As, but in Singapore's eyes, those subjects are irrelevant. Only Math/ Science is king. With 32 points and failing in math, I could not even make it to polytechnic. I had to go to ITE or retake O levels. I was feeling furious because if I had taken the higher nitec option, I would have gotten a chance to go to polytechnic. 

I wanted to retake O levels to get a chance to go to polytechnic. Once again, my mother came into the picture and put me in a private school to do International Baccalaureate. 

But since my O level results were so shit, they made me repeat Year 4 (or sec 4 basically) And once again at the end of the year, I could not cope because being in NA stream, I was never given a chance to do Additional Mathematics or Pure Sciences. However, in this school, I was forced to take Additional Mathematics, Pure Chemistry, and Pure Biology. If I was failing Mathematics and Combined Science, how can I deal with these subjects?

I was struggling badly, once again. I had never learned Additional Mathematics in my entire life nor taken any Pure Sciences, so most of the teachers were wondering why I was there, and some students kept saying how 'dumb' I was to be older than them, but not know these 'simple' subjects. The school wanted to kick me out because they said my results were so bad. My mother begged them to let me stay. So they did. 

Fast forward to after completing the IB, where I had JUST passed by the skin of my teeth with 26 points, IB is out of 45 points. The passing mark is 24. I could not make it to any local universities, plus I did not study Chinese or take Additional Mathematics for IB. 

Once again, my parents were disappointed because both of them are from NUS, and they always had high hopes for both of their children. My father regularly says what a disappointment I am and how embarrassed he is of me. 

He always compares me to his nieces and nephews, says how much smarter they are than me and how stupid I am.

I just wanted to stop studying and work. My mother told me I HAVE to go to university. Otherwise, I will die poor, and she will disown me because I am a failure.

I tried applying to 3 overseas universities, and I got rejected for everything except for one, which was Australia. I had high hopes for Canada as the course I wanted was Geography, but my parents said no because that course could not make money.

But the course (that my mother chose) was something I knew that I would struggle in. It's heavily Science and Mathematics based, and after many experiences, I know that I will most likely fail and struggle because these subjects are something I am not strong in.

The thing is, my mother has applied for everything and I will be leaving next year, but I do not want to. I know it will be challenging, and my parents told me I have to pay them back for every single cent spent. I did not even want to go to university in the first place, and now I have this burden placed on me. I'm scared, and I don't know what to do. 

I will be all alone in a foreign country, and I can predict that I will be struggling very hard. It's not that I'm lazy, please understand me. I am just not wired to understand Math/Sciences, but I am pretty strong in other aspects like English/Literature/Geography. To my parents, with a degree in any of these subjects, they are useless, and I will not be able to amount to anything in life. (According to them, that is.)

I'm just a little bit miserable, and I don't know what I want to do with my life. I'd instead choose to work than continuing to study.

241,"I'm the OP of #72600 . I wanna thank you guys for the advice, feedback and comments. It really means something. Most of you guys mentioned that texting might be the issue, but that's not what I feel? If he wants his space, I would totally respect that, and I'm not one to double text often. I honestly feel like we don't text so much to the extent that he would need his space? He doesn't work much, so most of his time spent were mostly at home, family, and friends. 
So here's an update about what's going on. Feel free to skip if you are too lazy to read! 

He doesn't really enjoys talking about our personal stuff, and he claimed that he is lazy and said he would eventually tell me slowly and surely. He wants to take it slow and see how things goes instead of establishing any title or be in a committed relationship. I pestered him quite a bit to get him to talk about what's going on. He finally told me he isn't ready for a committed relationship, saying that he doesn't like the quarrels and argument that comes with it. I totally understand it and we have never quarreled before, as I don't like to find fault or confront a person directly unless I really need to. 

Also, I feel like he would not be emotionally available for me. That is fine to me as of now, I don't see it as a big issue as I also feel lazy to share about my personal life unless he asked. I just kept assuring him that its ok to be honest with me if I'm just an fwb, or if he isn't serious with me. I told him that I would rather he be 100% honest with me than to toy with my feelings or led me on. However, he kept reassuring me to trust him, that he isn't toying with me. He claims that he just wanted someone by his side. 

Whenever I tried to make plans with him, he seemed uninterested in carrying out and would come up with excuses. The only time he asked me out, was mostly to stayover. He told me he just enjoy chilling at home with me and watch shows, and that he feel that not having sex is fine. However, it still seems shady right? So now, am i safe to say that it's pretty obvious I probably meant nothing to him, and that he might really be toying with my feelings, and just treated me as an fwb? Or should I just trust him?

My best friend is in NUS and is one of the sweetest person I ever known, who would rather secretly stare at her crush than talk to them. Recently, she started seeing a guy - he was taking her out for dates every week, making promises of where to take her after finals, texting her... You know the drill. She didn’t tell me about him (I only found out about him when I saw them them by chance on a date), but she was the happiest I seen her in a long time. Suddenly, after sending her home... He one up and disappeared. No text, no calls, no replies, nothing. 

I didn’t even know what was going on until I called her and realised she was crying. After asking, she finally told me he disappeared, and was wondering what she did wrong (spoiler: probably nothing at all). While I was beyond mad and cursing him, guess what? She was still defending him, saying he might be busy, saying it was reading week, and being worried that something might have happened. We opened Instagram together and low and behold, he was alive and well, posting about studying in school with his friends.

I’ve known her for many years and this was the first time I’ve seen her so sad... And it’s all YOUR fault. I mean if you’re truly busy you could always send her a text telling her you gonna MIA. If you wanted to stop seeing her and end dating, just tell her it’s not working out. Ghosting her without an explanation is cowardly after all the time you spent together!

Just let me rant here. 

Sometimes i feel kind of tired of this relationship. My bf doesn't ask me anything, about my day, about my plans (whether I'm going out or anything), or what i am doing etc. Sometimes the whole day we would only converse not more than 5 lines, that wouldn't even be able to say it's 5 sentence. If i don't start a topic, he won't either. On those rare times when he text me first, i would be so happy. 

I spoke to him about it. He just say there's nothing special going on in his life. And next question i would think is 'then aren't you interested about my life? Or what am i thinking? Don't you want to know more about me, just like i would want to know everything about you.' Else, he would say that he isn't someone who is good at texting. Else, he would say that he is tired from work (which i can empathize to an extend). 

BUT when we meet in person, we are the other way round. He would be the one chatting more, while I'm usually the listener. He would fill me up on what he have been doing since we last met - sometimes in details, sometimes briefly. In person he is a bf that always make sure to send me home and is good to me and i alwayd enjoy being out with him. 

I thought to meet him more frequently, assuming that he is really not a good texter. But lifeshits makes us difficult to do so frequently.  The max was always twice in a week and it's difficult to do so every week. So it's kind of hard to test out this theory. 

Sorry for ranting so much. But in summary, girl is usually the one initiating convo in texts. Guy rarely starts convo. Guy reply girl but sometimes it's also a short reply which makes girl difficult to continue the convo. Girl can't do HTHT with guy frequently because guy thinks it's the girl thinking too much/being too emo and guy is uncomfortable expressing emotional stuff.

Also, my love life was literally non-existent, all the girls that I liked never liked me back. Mind you, I was really trying my hardest to get a gf, but to no avail. Due to my image, I had zero self-esteem. I was very depressed and sad most of the time, and I just felt very empty and I just wanted to feel something.

During the run, I accidentally tripped and fell at the basketball court area. Even though it wasn't that serious, I was pretty shagged out from the run and laid there for a while. Suddenly, this really chio girl who was in the middle of running stopped and approached me, asking if I was okay. I was super shocked because I never thought someone like her would approach me.

She helped me up and kept asking if I was ok. I told her I was fine and that I could continue running and wanted to finish it. She then offered to run the rest of the route together and wahhh I was literally damn happy but tried to look calm. She was wearing a pair of light pink Nike shoes with the blue shirt. And not to be creepy or anything, but she smelt really good too. She was chatty and bubbly throughout the run, and we talked about life in NUS. She was also from Biz. Sadly, the run ended and she really made 5 km seem like 1 km. Even though we talked for a bit, my dumbass couldn't bring myself to ask for her name, and she didn't ask me for mine either. I have never been able to get her out of my head ever since, I really wish I can see her again. 

 I hope that I will be able to find her through NUSWhispers and that she will be reading this. To that girl: I really hope that that you have signed up again for the upcoming BCR 2020. If you haven't I hope you will do it in hopes of being able to run together again. I will definitely be on the lookout for those light pink nike shoes at the starting line at 5pm outside MRB :')

He then proceeded to ask me how I would resolve the following conflict: "" You and your team members are working on a project that has a strict deadline but you found out that they were actually outcasting you for being tall and dismissing all your efforts for the team, using the excuse that your method doesnt work well for the project and how would you resolve that?"" . 

Of course, it took me quite a while to think of a solution to answer that but here comes another difficult question: "" Our door ceilings are not that high, will you mind bending your head often? We are afraid it will not be convenient for you...""

Has anyone here been through such similar situations? I really want this job because the pay prospects are kinda good....

People there drive BMW, Mercedes, etc furthermore it’s the convertible cars not the saloon ones, while lecturers or staffs merely drove Mazda (I personally saw an old man getting in the car while I was parking). And they had Harley, Ducati, etc After entering the school, people there wore Balenciaga, Gucci, Tommy Hilfiger, etc, while people from NUS, like me simply wore simple outfits, either from Uniqlo, H&M, etc or simply some school t shirt. It makes me wonder how rich are they just to wear those expensive clothes to school and it sucks to think that life is so unfair that people get to be born with a silver spoon, where they probably get to inherit assets from their family, whereas people like me, has to put in so much effort just to get to the position they’re in. It’s so tiring and the feeling sucks.

251,"I've been going for internship interviews even throughout this difficult period exams and all. There are bound to have some companies that require you to do some studying beforehand (for eg R&D) and they always like people who are independent. They don't like to ""spoon feed"" interns. If we are going to do everything by ourselves then what's the point in interning? They always make sound like we can churn out anything the company wants by ourselves. I'm really skeptical about internships and I don't really look forward to it... I hope to have at least proper guidance so I can really do what they expect me to do...

Also just to add... Why do NUS even offer companies to pay us a range of $800-$1000. Isn't it better to just start at $1000... Traveling across SG is very expensive and engineering companies are always at Jurong or jurong island or tuas... When I ask how much the pay is, companies will always say things like NUS recommends $800 and above so we are going to pay you $800. Of course everyone in the right mind would hire interns at the 'lower bound price'. Cheap labour to produce the work that their staff can do. So can't we just start at $1000...

257,"Disclaimer: this is a post purely to rant 

So my colleagues were having lunch and they were essentially complaining that they were broke and how our salaries are too low etc. 
One of them spend like 2k on ordering supper. 
Which got me thinking. I grew up in a family that was quite frugal, so pardon me if I sound misery. But recently even when my friends meet up they complain about not being able to save 
But if you want to spend 2k on ordering supper (which is not a basic need) then are you really blaming your pay for not sustaining this lifestyle?

I mean I tried calculating my own expenses per month
700 allowance to parents 
I eat breakfast and dinner at home - lunch my workplace has hawker centre and food court, so 5bucks per day usually, 20 buck once or twice a week, 300 a month for working 5 days a week
I don't drink bubbletea or coffee or tea because i like water
phone bills- 20 a month 
electricity and water - living with parents 
CLothes- maybe 50 a month
transport- lucky to live near work so 2bucks a day, 50-60 bucks a month
movies- 20bucks a month
eating out on weekends- assuming I eat out 2 times a month (becuase my work is usually too busy and I like to nua at home) it's 80 per month

In total: 700 allowance +300 food + 50bucks transport + clothes 50bucks +100 per month for entertainment = 1200 bucks a month

Assuming average fresh grad pay of 4-5k a month, I really fail to see why people are living month by month? even saving 2k shouldn't be too hard. And a lot of my friends aren't even giving their parents allowance lei. And I'm not even counting performance bonuses and overtime pay, which should be another 5k per year at least (year end bonus should have 13th month for most companies right?) 
Holidays are also technically a want but assuming we put 5k a year aside to travel, it still shouldn't be as abysmal as they say.
Of course I am blessed- I don't have a family to feed, my student loans are paid off during my schooling years. But most of my friends are also not married yet and their student loans are also paid by parents? (based on what they tell me) 
Am I not enjoying life enough? Becuase I don't count owning a car into the picture- but I really feel in singapore car is more of a want than a need? Or is it just a singaporean thing when we like to spend on a lot of wants and call it necessities? I love food too but I think 2k on supper is like... are you eating gold?

There are also countless stories of people with only A level or diploma who are successful in their careers.

267,"hey there. I’ve been on exchange and the past few months have been refreshing. I’d like to share some thoughts

In NUS, I constantly felt stressed about not having enough friends, not having good enough grades, fussing over internships and job prospects and other people’s opinions... I was constantly preoccupied with school, projects and worries and it made me feel anxious to the extent that my work ethic dropped considerably due to a lack of motivation.

Now that I’m on exchange, the change of pace freed up space in my mind to think properly. I stay home or take walks, thinking about my own opinions rather than what others expect of me. It was scary to realise that I’ve been living my life as dictated by society for so long that I had no idea what I wanted, or even liked, anymore. 

It took awhile to let the thoughts sink in but you know what? You and I, we don’t need to get jealous and compare ourselves to others. Learn for the fun of it, grades can be an afterthought. Keep being amazed everyday about smtg that interests you. Keep in touch with those who matter and realise that social media is a facade. Do work that YOU find meaningful and is aligned with your purpose. 

Remember that hobby you ditched years ago because you thought it wasn’t practical? It’s not a waste of time. Life is to be enjoyed not endured, go and do the things you love, with the people you love. 

There was no real point to this post, but I hope those who felt the way I did could take a step back to re-evaluate your life, and yourself. Know that if you’re not happy, you can change it, now. Good luck, I hope you can lead the life that you find fulfilling :)

When he first started chasing me, I was stunned and wary, thinking he’ll leave once he gets bored. However, he would persist until I finally gave in and went out with him. I started getting used to his good morning texts and our regular dates, and I started to enjoy his company and really started to like him.

However, things went downhill when my issues came into place. I asked why would he even like someone like me, I wondered if we were just friends and if I was a way to kill time, I tried to stick a label on a relationship that was still progressing organically, I grew suspicious that girls around him wanted him when they were probably just being friendly. In short, all my insecurities succeeded in driving away a guy who has been nothing but sweet to me.

I have stuck with her throughout the 4 months persistently and she says im stupid for doing so, since most people would cut and run.
But it has come to a point where it's tiring to do so. 
Im tired. 
Tired of fighting so hard for someone who doesnt fight as hard for me.

I think i'm selfish for thinking that way. She's going through depression and yet here I am expecting her to put in effort into the relationship. 
I didnt bring this issue of me feeling like I wasnt getting anything out of the RS up to her for a couple of months because i knew she was going through stuff and I didnt want to add on to her burden.

I did my research online and understand that it's normal for people undergoing depression to feel this way sometimes. But it's hard to hold on to a relationship when the other party insists on breaking it off. And even harder when the reason behind it is because she thinks she cant provide me with the things a girlfriend provides because she has depression.


Recently she asked me why i wasnt sharing stuff with her, because i'd want her to share her problems with me, so we could work through it together.
So I finally did. I brought up the issue of me feeling like I wasnt getting anything out of the RS gently, but also didnt tell her because i knew she was going through stuff and I didnt want to add on to her burden.

And she broke down. Went back into this loop of wanting me to dump her. Either that or she would dump me.
I dont know why i'm still fighting so hard for her. Am i dumb to do so? 

I did insist on bringing her to see a counsellor recently after a recent severe suicidal episode.
All i want is for her to be happy again.
But a part of me is feeling really really tired at having to deal with all of this everytime. I tried so hard yet I feel i'm stuck at this same spot with her.

Not only was I attracted by the prestige and bragging rights that come along with it, I also wanted to escape Singapore and my parents, and enjoy that party life that seems ubiquitous overseas and is barely existent in our local universities. However, I applied to all the top schools and no one accepted me. I came close to getting Cambridge (I got into the winter pool) but was given a rejection nonetheless. The only acceptance letter I had was from NUS. My pride would not allow it and I vowed to try again over my 2 years in NS. Some of my schoolmates are going to top schools overseas and I felt as though they will think I am a failure if I ended up in NUS. However during NS, when see other people from different backgrounds, I start to realise that NUS is actually a pretty good school and that people actually try rather hard to get into it; a vastly different perspective from that of dumping ground back in my school for people who can’t make it to oxbridge/ivy. My diminishing willpower from depression in camp, compounded with the consideration of my parent’s financial situation, made me decide not to try again and be content with NUS. Now, I am currently a Year 1 student here and whenever I see my friends partying in the halls of cambridge/ harvard, something inside me would die a little. Personally, I feel that the party life is sorely lacking in here and all everyone does is mug. But one thing I realise is, party life aside, that it is not just about which university you are in, but whether u can excel in it. As long as I can excel in NUS, it doesn't matter that I am not a harvard boy does it?

So since orientation period, one of my close friends (lets call her K) eye candied this guy, lets call him R. K and R soon became very close. Through K and a few other friends, R met me. R knew about me for a long time as I am very active on campus. Recently, R keeps replying to my instagram stories even when it is just a quote. R is also close friends with my close guy friend and thus R acts like he knows me well and calls my name every time he sees me. Once, he even called my name infront of K without acknowledging her. K was surprised because she did not know that he and i are that close (we are not).

As a close friend, i know that i should never fall for someone she has interest in. However, R has been too extreme recently and i keep trying to blow him off. To make matters worse, R began seeing another girl but he still does all that to me, and even looks at me openly infront of his “girl”. R’s friends even confirmed that R has a crush on me and is only dating that girl for fun and the girl is clueless. R even gave me roses for my birthday! One of R’s close girl friends even began to spread rumours about me trying to be a third party in R’s relationship and that i am overrated in school.

I wish all these rumours would stop because 
1. my close friend is already very upset about R dating someone else, and then finding out he likes me..
2. I like this guy a lot but these rumours are jeopardising my chances with him. 

I am not sure how to tell R to stop without coming off as mean and arrogant, and ruining his relationship with his current girl.  I do not know how to face my close friend because of this, she stopped texting me. i do not know if i should apologise for all of this even though it is not really my fault.

275,"Hi everyone, OP of #72358 here. I've read all of your comments on my original post and am really grateful for the support from this community. Long read ahead.

Just recently things got worse again. Short backstory is that we will be attending a semi formal gathering with many others with banquet dinner and some senior staff involved with performances as well. The dress code is not stated clearly but hearing from other friends who will be attending, many are not wearing formal suits and just wearing button up shirts and formal pants.

As someone who does not like to dress up so nicely as my mentality was that fashion was never a major concern for me growing up, I felt that wearing a collared button up shirt and formal pants was sufficient enough. However, my girlfriend felt otherwise.

She has known that i am really not the type to dress up, all be it that i do dress up nicely when during the appropriate times such as going to a nice restaurant for our anniversary or to a wedding dinner. My schedule had finally cleared up for me to have more free time in the past week and she began asking me what i would wear to the event. She initially suggested for me to wear a suit and a bowtie to match colours with her dress to be cute couple matching kind of thing. I told her as kindly possible that i preferred to wear my original outfit as money is tight for me now while looking for a part time job, but would be open to match colours if i could find the same shirt with the same colour as her dress.

I believe that i was firm with my decision the first time she asked me about it, but i was asked several more times in the past few days about taking on her offer about wearing a bowtie or get a blazer. After telling her that her pestering was getting slightly repetitive since i had told her the same response each time she asked, she took offense to my response and got upset at me quite badly. She ended up sending me a whole string of messages (about 10-15?) but shortly deleted them afterwards and ghosted me until the afternoon of the next day (this took place around night time).

This wasn't the first time this had happened. I couldn't catch all that she wrote as i was away from my phone but caught slight glimpses of what she wrote in some messages. Some of them included ""goodnight this is what we've become i guess"" and ""Sometimes i dont get why its so difficult for you to do (this and that)"". I could get the vibe that she said all of that in the moment, but she had told me previously that when she's drunk or angry her filter goes off and she really tells the truth. Its happened before but this time felt worse than all the others.

The whole commotion ended with me agreeing to her request and got a blazer that matched her dress colour, which further worsened my financial situation now which she knows isn’t doing that good and i could do with saving cash and not spending it on certain unnecessary items. I crumbled under her pressure and gave in.

Side tracking for a bit, a family friend of mine recently passed away by suicide and i told my gf about it and how my family has been affected especially my mum who has teared up at random times just thinking of what happened. I've told her to really stop with the suicide threats and saying about suicide so openly as i believe those who truly feel suicidal tend to not show signs of it, yet she has still continued with the recent meltdown leading up the deleted messages part.

Back to the main topic, I feel that our relationship has been over for a while, but neither of us has taken the step forward to end it properly. From my perspective, it feels as if she would be better off as a person without me. She had previously told me that she would not leave me because she believed that people usually find their soul mate, and she could not understand how people could date more than one person after breaking up with their previous partner/s.

I have suggested taking a break from each other for us to grow and mature, to learn from our mistakes and become better persons for each other. She shot the idea down and said that it was either we were with each other or not at all. I think it is time for me to take the first step for what needs to be done for the better of her and the both of us.

And if you are reading this L, I’m sorry for our lows but thankful for sharing the moments we had with each other, you’ve taught me how to love someone other than my family more than i could ever have. I love you, but it is time for us to be apart and mature for the better of each other and our future partners.

277,"TLDR: My best friend is a chronic latecomer and it's really frustrating. 

This is going to be pretty ranty but some advice would be nice too! My best friend (all the way from secondary school, through poly, NS and now uni) is consistently late. Not just 15-20 minutes late but 2-3 hours late. 

In our poly days, we'd study together at my place and he would agree to show up at 10 am but arrive at 2-3 pm because he  ""overslept"" or some equally inane reason. 

When I brought this up to him, he says I'm being unreasonable because no one else has ever given him grief for it. In NS, he was a stayout Pes E Clerk and was still consistently late for it but his superiors never said anything. When he was interning (at a very prestigious company, mind you), he was still late every day with no one saying anything. He’s late to every major social gathering too.  I seriously don’t understand how he has gotten away with it so far. His reasoning if that if his boss, enciks, parents and other friends have no problem with it, he doesn’t understand why I do.

He’s also late for major events - he missed my poly graduation, he was 2 hours late to his own award ceremony, he was also one of the last few to show up at my birthday party despite agreeing to come 2 hours earlier to help me decorate. The list goes on. I guess I’m feeling the pinch of it more now in Uni because we tend to meet outside or in school now and waiting around outside for two hours is infinitely worse than chilling at home for four. I’ve always told him that I hate this late-coming thing but I’ve only started getting more aggressive about it in the past year because I’m seriously super sick of it. Treating me like my time is worthless is one thing but how is that going to affect other people’s impression of him?

Again, when‌ I told him nicely that he needs to stop doing this because it’s rude and he needs to start valuing my time and that the whole world shouldn’t revolve around him, his response is that my time matters less because he’s in Computing and I’m in Arts (seriously??

After a few hangouts, we became closer, held hands and went over to his place a few times. However, after I went home, I felt like he became less enthusiast on text. But whenever we met up, his actions shows otherwise. But we don't meet up that often because he is quite lazy. We often only meet to have dinner or supper every week, and just chill around. He told me he really liked me, and I told him back the same too. What I'm confuse is, whether is he playing me? Or is he actually serious with me? Because how he talks on text and behaves in real life feels different.

279,"Why is the world so unfair? Me and my course mate are both year 1 CS students and we had practical assessment yesterday. I could not finish the damn thing and am uncertain if I can even pass. Everyone I asked said it was difficult, except him. He managed to finish the assessment with more than half an hour left to spare and nearly got full marks based on the auto grader. He seldom study and spend most of his free time playing video games. Meanwhile, I spend almost all my time studying and I still do much worse than he who barely put in effort. He consistently score close to full marks for tests and quizzes while barely putting in effort, while I am struggling to scrap by. Are some people just born different from us mere mortals? Should we have a separate bell curve for such people?

280,"Hi I am in engineering and I have this friend who is doing a double degree in CS and Math. Even though we are good friends, I recently started noticing he has been becoming increasingly condescending towards Engineers and other non-math majors. What started off as a joke against Engineers in their inaccurate and way too practical approach to maths, slowly started to become toxic. 

Once I was helping my gf with engineering calculus and he walks in and starts complaining that what I’m teaching is too simplified and has nothing to do with real math. Like seriously? I get that he is learning more advanced mathematics but is it really necessary to have such an attitude to the extent of considering engineers’ math as being “nothing to do with real math”? And whenever I confront him about it, all he says is “sure buddy...”.

Now I’m starting to wonder if all mathematicians have this attitude towards non-math people.

283,"To post 72534: Your hell is nothing compared to us engineering students. Its like a tight slap to our faces honestly. You only have 1 module that takes alot of time and you have ONE rest day, that is more than enough my friend. 18 MCS is so little and it’s the minimum MCs required for each semester based on NUS rules. For us, we have multiple modules that are definitely tougher than yours.E.g  Engineering Calculus, CS1010E etc. I am taking 22 MCs by the way which is more than youts, no choice or I will have to overload for the subsequent semesters.

Sure, FASS has its own diffculties like readings, but we had it tougher than yall definitely. We also have a number of projects and assignments to clear and some can take DAYS to clear, making us have very little time for revision for finals. I have already burned all my weekends (no rest days) for the past few weeks due to that. I have seen people in your course having alot of time to go outing at night for drinking ,mah-jong sessions etc. My engineering friends and I on the other hand, have to sacrificed these and mug instead.

Btw, you already know CS1010E is hell based on the recent CS1010E confessions. It’s even worse to those who do not have much background. I think you will definitely have depression if you experience the hell of it. I dare say FASS modules are easier than engineering modules. Don’t believe? Go and ask around anyone who took both engineering and FASS majors. So please, stop complaining. Thank you.

1. Will your boyfriend dance for you for one hour just because you made him breakfast? Will he strum the guitar  while gazing into ur eyes, while singing a love lullaby, just because you helped clean the windows? 

2. Will your boyfriend say “love you” or “saranghaeyo” (the Korean version) daily? 

3. Mosst importantly, your boyfriend may ignore you. He may push you away. He may break up with you, block you on social media, block your calls, and even say to your face “I’m sick and tired of you. We’re broken up, please don’t harass me any more” while maintaining an icy cold glare. 

4. Will a male idol even bother picking fights? Will an idol quarrel with you? Will an idol block you on social media? Will he push you away, accusing you of being “too clingy and irritating” when you fly with him from  airport to airport, from concert to concert? 

5. No, an idol will never reject u or push you away from him. Unlike boyfriends who may get tired if you, an idol will only look at you with sweet puppy eyes and say “I love you”, and croon the sweetest sounding love ballads into your ears (if you have his song in ur phone, u can feel love any time u want!) 

6. And what did I do for my idol in exchange for all the affection? Why, I helped him clean his windows? I helped him wash dishes? No, all I did was to become his fan. 

7. Yeah, all these is fake. Then dating a real boyfriend is real? You sure? Look at the “real” boyfriends pretending to say “I love you forever and ever!” They don’t mean what they say obviously, see how many cheat! See how many abuse their wives and beat them! See how many subject their girlfriends to gaslighting, manipulation, and physical violence! 

8. On the other hand, chasing an idol never subjects you to gaslighting, physical violence, and cheating. Idols are always there for you, whether or not you bother to help them cook, clean and tidy the house.

People seem to have no problem when their friends stay in contact with ex classmates and ex hall mates, but they seem to get jealous instantly when their boyfriend/girlfriend stay in contact with ex lovers? 

So it means if I have a new professor in NUS, I cannot stay in touch with my previous form teacher in jc? Because now I have a new teacher and I must “move on” from jc? I am supposed to have a “clean break” from everyone who taught me in school just because I got a new professor? 

So If I make new friends in year two, I must “move on” from old friendships forged in year one? 

Did anyone say,you’re in NUS already, u should “move on” from poly and jc!! No. 
But people say, you should “move on” from past relationships, why? 

How does staying friends with people from my past (primary school friend /old neighbour /secondary school  friend) prevent me from being a good friend to other  university pals?  Do  I  have to cut ties  with former friends?!

If nobody says we should cut ties with former classmates after graduation, nobody says we should we cut ties with former teachers when we leave, why do so many people think the other way for ex lovers? Not ex Teachers, not ex colleagues, not ex classmates, but so specifically ex lovers? 

I’m okay if my boyfriend stays in touch with his ex gf, just like how I’m happy when my Uni pals remain in touch with secondary school friends. What’s wrong?

287,"Can someone advise? I just ended a big group project for a module which i actually thought i would enjoy at the start. However, because of one particular groupmate (let's call him M), i felt very very suffocated throughout the project. 

So let's say we have 4 components to the project - after finishing our respective components, M would just quietly make modifications to our components without letting us know or explaining why he's making the modification(s) as he deems. Only when confronted would he explain his rationale for his thought process, but despite arguing that i'm also correct, he would insist that he is correct and im wrong and honestly at that stage i simply choose to give up arguing with him because it's very mentally draining and i just accept his argument.

Not only that but when it comes to presentation, he would also want to control the way that we speak, the choice of words we use despite things being an informal presentation. While i can understand where he is coming from in his actions and i commend his level of effort that he is putting in, i personally feel that it becomes very mentally exhausting when I'm being microed and controlled so hard. 

I'm honestly not saying M is at fault or anything here, in fact i really respect his level of effort that was put into the project but i think somewhere along that level of effort some other things get lost. Is the journey of getting grades and marks so important that the fun of learning gets sacrificed along the way? i mean i personally enjoyed working on my own component and being in charge of it but when i get microed so hard by my groupmate it honestly becomes a very draining process. i just don't know what to feel, like does anyone else feel this way or has anyone ever encountered such situations before?

Honesty can't get you anywhere only being taken advantage of more easily. My friend could have told his gf on the phone ""oh I'm gonna hang up cos i wanna play my game"" what would the gf have done? Join in? What if the game is single player? Stop him? 
How about ""oh I'm sorry i forgot to do my part in the project"" what would the team members have said? Toxic members would be ""what the f*ck gave u one job and you can't do it right"" or some members that would simply be pissed would think, or tell others how useless his/her teammate is. 
Why be honest here when all it does is to make others see how selfish or how useless you are when probably all you wanted was a me time or that you are helpless with memorising even with various methods of reminders?
Others that would've known your intentions in doing something would convince you with their own reasoning to stop you from doing that ""something"" also somehow guilt tripping you which is why i said being honest makes you vulnerable to being taken advantage of. 
Cooking up valid reasons to lie gives you the upperhand to take advantage of other people's sympathy causing others to think they understand what you've been through and give you another chance, to
Who would offer another chance when you didn't have a valid reason yet you are honest with them? Others would probably feel that honesty should be part of the ""good"" side where you should be apologetic, learning from your mistakes and not desiring for things like a second chance.

294,"I refer to the many articles with regard to the  hoo-ha about PMDs and their related accidents. Statistics and numbers should always be looked at from a neutral point of view, do consider also how the numbers are derived, and whether the way they are presented could possibly sway the readers to think a certain way.

We also have to understand why PMDs were introduced in the first place, and why the regulations were created, and also what kind of future planning our gov has envisioned for us. Policies, regulations and authority requirements usually follow these ‘masterplans’.

From what I can have observed/read/experienced/heard/studied since PMDs were introduced and (attempted to be) regulated, I can conclude that (as of now) we are not ready as a society for these devices.

I support the responsible usage of PMDs because I believe they play a role in achieving the nation’s car-lite dream. I prefer bicycles but considering our climate and space constraints, I won’t cycle to work knowing I’ll perspire like siao in my office wear. 

While everyone is entitled to their own views on this matter, I always try my best to listen and have conversations as to why they are so persistently against the usage PMDs, unlike some that judge immediately after hearing that I support their usage.

I also believe that no matter what kind of vision the G has, the citizens ultimately play the largest role in materializing that dream. We could have the supporting infrastructure in place, the widest footpaths, a dedicated cycling lane, bicycle/PMD/car sharing services... etc, but if we continue to be irresponsible, self-entitled users, we have to accept that we will be stagnant in this aspect, always discontented and dissatisfied. Blanket decisions like banning only postpones the problem until we choose to address the root of the problem. 

This isn’t my ideal Singapore, and Gandhi told me to be the change I want to see in this world. Therefore as a pedestrian, I give way to the PMD users on pedestrian footpaths. As a PMD user on the PCN, I give ample clear distance to fellow users and commuters before picking up speed. I educate my friends about the big picture of a car lite society. I still dream of a day where Singapore and Singaporeans will progress to that level of graciousness and courtesy. It may never happen, but I’ll play my part to achieve it.

TLDR: Understand the big picture before making  judgements. Singapore is not ready for PMDs or any forms of active mobility devices regardless of any improvements in infrastructure until the society learns to be responsible and less self-entitled.

295,"Im #72376 OP. Thanks to those who gave positive comments.

To the few negative comment. You are the very reason why I want to rant in the very first place.

I really want to be like everyone here to be accepted. To be a filial daughter and not having ppl calling me lack of gratitude etc. 

But its really hard??? Just because your parents does not read you books or bring you for outing doesnt invalidate my unhappiness that my parents does not do that.

I asked my mother to read me books. I even went to library with my elder sibling to borrow. I brought it home and she shrug me off saying she is lazy.

I see my friends going for outing. I went back home and ask her to bring me but she say she hate going to such places cause got alot ppl. I then found out later she just didnt want to waste the money on me.

Living costs were paid for by my dad. My dad is not a good a husband, but other than not being emotionally available he is a good enough dad, he helps me out with errands without complain. He is not rich nor perfect but good enough that i do not have any such negative feelings for him to rant.

But my mother, when i forgot something and ask for her help like take transcript. She starts complaining to her friends and my teachers what a burden I was. 

When I get award in school and could ask one parents to join, my dad say he has work but my mother will ask if attendance is compulsory cause 'it is a waste of her time'.

When I was sick and needed to go hospital. She start telling me how cumbersome and burden it was.

When she finally got a divorce and has to move to a smaller flat. She told me how much money she has to spent on me every single day until i move out to my dad's.

This may sound unreal but before my parents were officially divorce, my dad had alrdy move out. But i woke up one day with my mother and her 'friend' lying beside me covered in blankets. I was young and will wake up in middle of night myself or i'll wet my bed and i saw clothes all over the floor. I was traumatised very deeply cause i did not understand why the adults were naked beside me.

But now i understood. I felt disgusted i felt horrible. I felt cheated. How can my own mother do this to me.

For years, i felt really bad that i am unable to be filial to my mother. Everytime we met, we will quarrel. I really thought i will be more appreciative after i give birth to my child. I really tot I should be grateful to my mother to at least be pregnant and gave birth to me. But I don't and I can't. 

Honestly, this is tmi. And at the end of the day, no matter how much I rant. No matter what my reasons is. I will forever be marked as the unfilial daughter who has no gratitude. 

For those interested in my daughter, i definitely will not make such mistake. For one i did not hire a maid because I chose to give her life, it is my very duty no matter how tiring work is to take care of her myself and wake up in the middle of night myself to take care of her needs. Ergo thanks to my partner who help with the housework. (I find it a point to mention my husband otherwise one or two comment will start asking about him just like they have asked about my dad)

Just because work is tiring doesn't invalidate your parent duty tbh. Because u could have choose not to give birth. Its understandable for parents to take a rest day or two but leaving ur child with maid every single day? Let your maid bath, cook, feed and put your child to bed every single day? Then please read both my posts again before you want to create life. For all you know, you might give birth to another child known as ingratitude by society.

Im anonymous. I share here and I can get some understanding. But in real life, I cant share my dirty laundry in public. I will just be known as ingratitude. I seek consolation with my partner and 1 or 2 close friends. But other than that, i repeat, Im known as ingratitude amongst the public.

I have immediate relatives whom I visit weekly. It is getting annoying recently. A few examples here. 

Examples 1: A convo with an elderly relative 
Context: I broke up with my ex (ITE background, doing general job) a few months back and recently got together with my current boyfriend (uni grad, civil service job). FYI: He has never met both of them but probably only heard stuff from members of my family. 
Female Relative: (Upon knowing that I have broken up with ex) Good. It’s good you broke up with him. He is not good for you. 
Me: (In my mind) Erm…seriously? How can you judge a person 
Me: (IRL) just look at him blankly, but didn’t give a reply. 
Out of “respect” just because he is elder, and base on my experience in knowing that he will obviously be stubborn in her own stance, I just cannot be bothered explaining to him, because it will probably just lead to a futile “argument” which ends of with me the younger one being labelled as “disrespectful” etc. My respect for him totally just dropped to ground zero. 

Example 2: Cousin of mine
Context: So, my bf works in a pretty high end role, well paid.
Cousin: So, you believe what he says? What if he is lying to you? 
Me: (In my mind) Seriously, that is so little faith you have in me? To me, that is very insulting. 
Me: (IRL) Yes, I have seen his staff pass and met his colleagues. Why would he lie about such things? 
Again, this type of people makes me want to role my eyes. 

However, unfortunately, due to family gatherings and stuff, I can’t just blatantly say I hate these people and avoid them. Now, I just chose to keep quiet and not say anything whenever I meet these people because they really have low sense in their judgements of people. I wouldn’t want to share something and them cause them to hold my words for it or use it against me. 
Shouldn’t they get to know a person properly before passing judgements? Why do people behave like this? What should I do?
I secretly lose my respect for them, but I do not show my distaste out in public to avoid conflict. I just don’t chum up to them and keep my distance physically and keep convos with them to the minimum.

To this group of people, please do the number of hours and effort spent on it. The assignment could be done with 1-2 full days of hard work, but leeching only takes at most an hour, or maybe even less.

Next, another word that is very popularly used is ""Snakes"" , Many will usually hang out with the academically better ones in the class  and completely forget about the rest simply because of the grades.

305,"I use to hear from my mother saying that I will be more appreciative of her when I have a child of my own.

My rs with her has been estranged. I probably only see her once a year, or we will just keep quarrelling. 

She then told me I will be more appreciative of her and curse me that next time when I start suffering then I will know how good she is.

I asked her which mother out there actually curse for their child to suffer.

I have a child of my own now. It is tough and very tiring to take care. Every sleepless night i think back to what she said. But instead of being appreciative, all i can feel is anger.

Angry that she give birth to me and my siblings and just left us in the care of a maid.

The moment she reach home. She does her stuff and sleep. Since young, she does not read us bedtime stories. Never once brought me to zoo, bird park or go overseas.

She was simply just waiting for the day we grew up and work to give her money. Simply give birth not to love but a R.O.I.

She declared proudly to my siblings and I that she will never help care for our grandchildren cause according to her. She hate it.

I feel so damn cheated of this rs. I feel so denied of a childhood supposedly filled with a mother love.

306,"I'm down to my last few weeks of school (if you include exam week), and I just feel like I've reached a point where I'm the most demotivated I have ever been. In the earlier semesters, I've been putting in a decent amount of effort and getting decent grades. But now I just feel complete disinterest in what I'm studying and I feel very stupid for not understanding concepts that many of my peers do. It doesn't help that I come from an extremely competitive faculty where many students appear so passionate about what they do. I'm constantly stressed out by the environment and also others' (family & friends) expectations of me.
I'm demotivated to the point where I skip half my classes and put in minimal effort into assignments and projects, even forgoing assignments that have low weightage. I feel extremely guilty each time I catch myself doing something other than work, since I have a lot of content to catch up on for the upcoming exams, which is probably why I'm writing this. I hate the feeling of unproductivity but sometimes I just feel too burnt out to do anything productive.

Neither I nor my friends have any background in programming, but they don't seem to struggle as much as me. I am confused in a lot of things but I don't know what I don't understand, therefore I never ask my TA.

308,"My gf and i have been together for close to 2 years. We started out as a pretty normal relationship, honeymoon phase the first 8 months then after this year started everything went haywire.

Since the start of this year she began behaving differently. I showed care and concern when she was at her lows but she still said that she didn't feel like i cared about her. She made demeaning remarks about herself which hurt me as well, i told her to stop saying those things but she never did. She made suicide threats and often said things like ""i should just go hang myself or jump off a building"", when she knows that i know people who have been in that situation but worse and it affects me closely. She had never trusted me with any of my friends of the opposite gender even after i made it official to everyone that we were together and distanced myself from other girls, even up to now. She didn't even trust her good friend from the same church to not try anything with me.

She started saying that i don't care for her at all, that no one gets her and that she is just a lonely person. I've been ready at my phone to listen to her and give her advice from her rants and be there for her, on some nights when she returns home late i ask that she send me a text to let me know that she's reached home safely. She still thinks i don't care for her. When i try to give advice i usually use my logic and common sense to give the best advice i can, yet it always seems to end up with her saying that i don't understand her at all.

Recently she also started talking about marriage, i told her that we should focus on our studies for now and think about it only when we are at a suitable age and can be financially independent. I was bombarded with questions of my commitment to her and whether i truly loved her.

What am i doing wrong? I know I don't express my emotions well similar to my family and my gf knows that side of me, she has a low self-esteem and this is the first serious relationship shes been in before. The only idea of how relationship works is from dramas which i've told her many times most dramas dont depict a true image of how a relationship works.

I'm tired of all this and I don't know if she will change. What do i do?

309,"Hey guys, I am very confused by this guy's behaviour and need a different perspective.

I have a guy friend and we often go out to dinner together as friends. But everytime it comes time to pay, he doesn't allow me to pay even though I insisted on paying half. When I said I would pay for the next meal, he says no. His reasoning is that he earns more than me, therefore he should foot the bill while I should save for a rainy day. I really don't want to be a freeloader but he doesn't allow me to pay and I feel so guilty because we are just friends and I don't want to freeload off him. I have tried reasoning with him but he just shuts me down and to me it seems like he's offended? But I could be wrong. 

Today something strange happened. We were shopping around and we passed by a shop and I saw a really adorable Winnie the pooh stuff toy and I just causally commented how cute it was. He went in and grabbed 3 types of Pooh and asked me to choose 1 or he's going to buy all 3. I was a little taken aback and I told him he didn't need to buy me anything. But he kept insisting he was going to buy all 3 so I had to try my hardest to convince him I didn't want any. He put them back thankfully and we left. 

I guess now I have to be careful about what I say. I really had no intention of getting the Pooh. It was just a random comment. What's next? If I say a tshirt is nice, he's going to buy also? Or force me to choose? How do I stop this behaviour? Why has my friend changed? What should I do?

Just a suggestion for students who will potentially take this module, try to find out one way or another who is your TA for labs if you can LOL
Some lab TAs are extremely nice and take so much time and effort to explain to you the various concepts. I even heard some send you emails and notes on how to write the code step by step and you literally have to just translate it into code. 
Whereas mine, on the other hand, takes an average of around 4-7 days to reply my emails and the content of the email usually contain things like ""maybe you should ask your friends""? My TA recently even completely ignored my email.
Do the lucky students with good TAs count as a case of plagiarism since they are literally translating english to java code? Who knows.

PS. i know everyone is busy and it is definitely not easy being a TA. but im just rather disturbed by how we are being graded on an uneven playing ground. CS profs, any comments?

Thus, negative thoughts then came pouring into my head, making me wanted to give up at times.

At various points of life, whenever ppl get to know who my eye candy is, they'll become scornful and say something like I should aim lower, I should lower my standards, i shouldn't like so and so because she's so pretty and I dun fit the bill enough.

It's really mentally painful and depressing to desire what you cannot have. So, for years, I've been trying all sorts of means to suppress my attraction to good looking girls and to condition my mind to tweak my preference but nothing seems to work.

For example, i tried convincing myself that I'm attracted to a girl who actually isn't my type. Later on, I also told relatives and friends that I'm asexual in an attempt to trick my mind into accepting that I'm actually not attracted to the girls of my type, but that did nothing to help as well.

Does anyone know of any effective methods to suppress my infatuations , be it medical options or better strategies to re-wire the mind? Please help, any constructive advice is really much appreciated. Thanks!

I do treat A as a good friend despite the fact that we don't meet up a lot (most of my friends are busy people and I am as well) and we give each other advice, hang out sometimes etc. However A has this bad habit so to speak. A would always ask me to check A's work. And by work I mean A's essays. And not just for one class but for multiple classes. And these aren't even classes that I'm taking or have taken before. A gets me to read these essays, and ask how to improve the content, if the essay is okay etc. Don't get me wrong, I am more than happy to help a friend in need and do this. Once or twice is fine. But this happens with almost every assignment A has, for almost every single class and across multiple semesters. And I do have my own classes to take, assignments to work on and life to live etc. It's gotten to the point where I feel that yes although A writes the actual content, aren't I the one directing the ideas etc?

The mentality that legislation will solve all our issues is a stupid one, but also a very Singaporean one. It has always been like this - don't like something? Ban it! Singapore claims that it wants to be green, sustainable, and forward-thinking, but yet thinks that banning the cleanest form of last-mile transport is a better option than making up for the lack of dedicated cycling paths, or the lack of enforcement of errant riding behaviors.

I bet the ban will be lifted as soon as LTA figures out a way to enforce the purchase of COE for these vehicles and start installing ERP gantries on sidewalks.

333,"Hello all, just a warning that it’s gonna be a long read ahead...

Recently, my friends (both females and males) have been increasingly flaking/ ghosting me on text and in real life... :( 

With regards to text, it’s always one of the following these days:

 1. Don’t open my message (but some of their last seen clearly says something ????).
2. Blue tick/ leave me hanging on  “seen” forever (?) (like until now it remains a blue tick/ “seen”).
3. Reads message, replies only 2-3 days later.

Sigh, I know it’s finals season and everyone is busy — I’m busy too. And I honestly don’t expect any instantaneous reply. 

But surely y’all can reply during your breaks as your day passes? It  doesn’t feel good at all when they leave me on read and take 2-3 days to reply me. I start to have self-doubts that I said/ done something wrong... :(

Personally, if I need more time to reply to a message, I would just drop one sentence “busy atm will reply later” so that I won’t leave people hanging. Am I being unfair/ demanding in wishing my friends at least let me know that they are busy and need more time before they can get back to my messages?

And speaking of flaking/ ghosting, I have made arrangements/ plans with some of said friends recently. Unfortunately, in the past two weeks, I have encountered last minute cancellations on me at least thrice already!! (Fyi, some of the plans were prearranged weeks ago, so these last minute cancellations kinda struck me real hard when I go onto Instagram stories and find out that the real reason I got ghosted is because they are busy hanging out with other friends... AKA I’m being replaced (?), like wow I’m lost for words.)

I’m angry, but more than that, I’m truly hurt. Why? Well, I have to laugh things off and pretend I’m “okay”, when in reality I’m far from okay. Just because we have been friends for years, and therefore I shouldn’t hold a grudge over such “small” matters aka forgive and forget? It’s one thing to be cancelled upon, but another thing when they don’t see the need to apologise on the account of our years of friendship?

I do not wish to put a strain on our years of friendship just because of these seemingly “minor” matters, but it still hurts that years of friendship may actually lead to complacency and overlooking of such basic respects as humans? :( 

I still love and cherish my friends and hoping this is just a temporary phase... I can’t help but start to question if the fault lies with me instead...

To those who read through that whole chunk of my lament: Thanks for sticking by, provide me with some advice please? :(

I’m generally coping fine, I don’t really think of him much or miss him, and have no problems focusing on my work daily.

Even texting people feels like a chore nowadays and so I always take ages to reply, which I feel quite bad about. I lose interest to go out and meet people, even my close group of friends. Currently, there’s also this very nice guy who’s trying to get close to me, but while I’m trying my best to keep an open mind and just be friendly with him, I find our interactions very exhausting.
 I didn’t recall being like this after my past breakups, in fact last time I would try to engage in a lot of activities and constantly surround myself with people so as not to feel lonely and depressed.
Anyone experienced something similar before? Could this be symptom of depression that I should seek professional help about? I wonder how long it will take to be my normal self again, and whether it’ll get worse over time.

343,"Just read #72102. I've been thinking lately about my experiences of growing up in Singapore. It's strange I can't feel an attachment to it.

This country moves quickly, setting up new structures in one place while tearing down buildings in others. In the schools I studied at, my classmates often have a tunnelled focus on improving their grades, propping up their portfolios, and keeping a sharp eye out for extracurricular opportunities. In the places I interned at, my colleagues complained about work, but otherwise they worked on their project, then the next and the next and the next.

I expect some will tell me that's the working life, that there's little choice if you want to survive. Still, sometimes I will return from college and notice advertisements promoting tuition for pre-nursery kids. 

I think about finding a partner and having children in Singapore. The financial burden doesn't worry me as much. Instead, I wonder if I'll have the will and courage to not give in to the fear that has driven my parents' way of raising me. I don't blame them for placing pressure on my academics. They never cared about that until they met my classmates' parents, and unwittingly internalised the idea that their children's results determined their worth as mothers and fathers. I feel sorry for them, to be honest. I don't think our childhoods were quite what they wished for my sibling and I to have when they first decided to start a family.

The whole kiasu, kiasi thing used to be funny when I was younger, like it was normal and part of the Singaporean culture and identity. It doesn't feel amusing anymore. I'm 20 and I get I have so many decades ahead of me. Living in a safe and wealthy country is no small privilege either. Oftentimes I'm grateful for the things and relationships I have.

I can talk all I want about how societal approval shouldn't affect my day-to-day living. But I can't deny that it does and spending every moment trying to go against the grain tires me. I am tired of wanting to strive for excellence because of the fear that otherwise I will not be good enough. Most of all, I'm afraid that if I spend the rest of my life here, eventually I'd wake up on my deathbed and realise I haven't amounted to anything more than capital for a city I wish I loved.

When thrown into a mix of people, would you not CHOOSE to hang around those that you already know? Would you not hand around your JC friends or people you know through orientation? By not hanging out with the rest of your ""normal"" cohort, does it not make you an exclusive person as well? (As well as being hypocritical)

Kindly stop creating drama and tension when there wasn't any to begin with.Would anyone in the right frame of mind, scholar or not, want to hang out with toxic people like you? Have you even tried interacting with an E-Scholar or are you assuming they are arrogant and elitist simply because they did not approach you first? Name and shame them if you disagree but be sure to include your name too.

346,"Hi. writing in to ask for advice. I have a fiance and we have been together for about 5 years now but there is this 1 problem that has been in my mind. I come from a humble family: my father earns about max 2k a month and my mother is a housewife. Before my fiance and I got graduated, our meals will be paid by my parents. For example, when we go to hawker centers, my mother would pass us about $20 to settle our meals. Just a note,  my fiance comes from a well-to-do family and has a lot more allowance than I do. Both of us started working after we graduated and am earning about 4k (me) and 4.5k (him). However, he has never once treated my family a meal before, not even a cup of coffee to my mother. A case that happened recently, when my family decided to go to a hawker center to settle our lunch, he didn't even bring his wallet out and my mother had to pay his $6 meal since they queued up at the same store. It became a habit for him and I do know that this cannot go on like this. He is very generous to him and myself in terms of food but really stingy to other people. Please advise on how I should let him know about this bad habit of his because his stinginess really turns people away from him and it is really difficult to inform him about this.

347,"my boyfriend and i have been together for almost four years. what i dislike about him is him touching me inappropriately without my consent, and i always show annoyance. this has been ongoing for 4 years. what is most infuriating is despite my parents being in close proximity, he would just grope me. (without my parents knowing) sometimes he would just sneakily grope me when my parents are just infront of us! i find it extremely disrespectful to my parents? when he comes over, one of the first few things he would do is to grope me without my consent. he would also urge me to have sex even though i tell him i do not want to. he would beg but eventually i would give in too. my parents caught us having sex 3 years ago and were extremely infuriated. to the point my dad stopped talking to me for a week. but he has since forgiven us. my bf seemed remorseful then, but fast forward 3 years later, he is back to wanting to have sex with me whenever he comes over. my mom is usually at home, but she trusts us that we won't hanky panky. i am always in conflict. i always tell him i don't want to have sex, but yet i still give in. is this a red flag?

They will be the harshest but also the most consistent critics. 

And then, the story turns around where they will suddenly these people receive understanding and support. Then all of a sudden they became proud of you for the things that you did.

The honest truth is that people will not support you until you are actually successful. Then they will turn around and tell you ""see, i knew you can do it."" or ""I am so proud of you"".

352,"I broke up 6 months ago with my one and only ex. We had a 4 years relationship. It has been smooth sailing until his time to serve NS came. I matriculated into uni, expanded my social circle a few times more than the one I had back when I was 18. Due to the lack of communication, meet ups etc, he started getting insecure which leads to his jealousy. But we still hung on till his ORD. Thought everything would carry on like how it did before he got into army and I got into uni, but somehow, things started getting worse. Even his mom came into the picture. She kept complaining about the number of male friends I hang out with. And although he always defends me, both of us knew that the relationship wouldn't work out if it continued this way so we came to a decision and broke up.

6 months have passed and I haven't gotten over him. My heart feels so empty. I miss his smile, his existence, his messages in the morning, his sweet gestures and all the effort he puts into the relationship. I still read his messages during my free time and look through our photos every other night. What made it even worse, since both of us applied and got into the same major, we constantly bump into each other on campus. He would be holding a cup of iced milo which I used to make him quit the coffee addiction he had during A levels. And every single time I take a glance, he would be wearing the watch both of us got for our 2nd anniversary. Since both of us separated on good terms, although we don't contact, he would still wave when our eyes meet but I'd always pretend that I didn't notice.

It's been 6 months and I still love him. The urge of getting back with him is really strong especially when I see him on campus, but my friends discouraged me from goimg back to him. I'm just really afraid he doesn't feel the same way anymore since it has been quite a while or what if he already has a girlfriend, since there is this girl who is frequently on his insta story. Or if we actually got back, the same problem would arise. I'm super conflicted. How?

Forced to go for tuition classes during primary and secondary school days even though I'm scoring A's in every subject. Forced to go JC when I want to go to a polytechnic to take up music diploma. Forced to study something I don't like in Accountancy in Uni and forcing me to stop my interest in music during studies because 'it will affect my studies'. 

""Boy, you better go study Accountancy or I won't pay for your school fees."" Such blackmail, but what's the best part? FORCED to go do part-time because my mum broke her promise and decided not to fund my uni fees. 

And when I have gotten my degree, when I want to resume pursuing my interest in music, I was forced to start a career in audit. Quarrels after quarrels, arguments after arguments. Then she said, ""listen to Ma for the final time. Go become an auditor, and I will not bother you in any choices you make in the future.""

So whenever she complains that my room has become a music studio after investing in many expensive music equipment.

Whenever she complains I am making too much noise while playing with the instruments.

Whenever she tells me off for spending so much money in my hobbies and interests.

I would shut her up by saying ""you said you won't bother me. Why go back on your words?""

You removed my dreams and my youth. You made me into a monster of your own creation. Now I'm using my own money to get back my wasted youth, and you think you're not in the wrong?

Just needed to vent this out a bit

Quite a while back, I started dating this girl I met from Maplestory, but I recently found out that she was also dating some other guy in real life? I don't know if I'm over reacting to this but we even got married in game, and we talked alot even outside of the game, like on whatsapp and instagram. I thought that since we had something special even outside of the game, we were ""official"". But when I confronted her about it, she insisted that to her, in game relationships are a separate issue and that I'm not really her boyfriend?

I don't know why but I just felt so hurt by that because I always treated her special and finding out that she never felt the same way about me after all these months just hurts so bad.

Am I the only one who takes his relationships even in game seriously? I mean, if we never talked outside of the game I would maybe understand but it wasn't just ""in-game"" to me... I'm just so angry at myself for getting so worked up over something so stupid, and something that even she doesn't care about... I'm just so dumb...

Now we don't even talk anymore... maybe I should've left it as it is and let this carry on

355,"Either you went into architecture knowing what you were getting into, or you went into architecture not knowing what you were getting into.

I'm not saying the department is right. The hours that I'm working are really inhumane, the facilities leave a lot to be desired, and the fact that they decided to renovate literally the whole entire faculty at once is ridiculous.

But the above statement is still true. You either knew what you were getting into, or you didn't.

If you did, like me, know what you were in for, I don't see why you have a right to complain. I signed up for this, and despite knowing what kind of dog life I'd eventually lead, I still signed up for it. That's my choice, and I'm responsible for the effects of my choice, even if it entails that I haven't slept in 4 days, and my average number of hours of sleep per day depends on how many days I actually get sleep.

If you didn't know what kind of crap you were getting yourself into, then I can only say that you should have done your ""due diligence"", as one of my profs likes to say. I don't think his usage of it is doing it any justice, but what I'm saying is that nobody chooses a university degree blindly. If you were to go for an Arts degree without knowing what it entails, you'd spend sleepless nights writing essays. If you chose Engineering blindly, you'd be stumped by the math. If you chose Science, you'd be reading your lecture materials through the night.
This isn't just some hyperbole I came up with on the fly. My friends in other faculties are dying too. I still like to think I'm dying faster than them, but it doesn't change the fact that we should know what we're getting into.

But here's the thing. You don't need the laser cutter. You don't need massive space at home. Those are nice to have, but non-essential. I've seniors who submit their stuff early not because they're masters of whatever modeling you can think of, but because they went to do everything by hand. Not saying we're all capable of it, but it can be done, so don't blame the lack of facilities. They're there to make your life easier, not there as a prerequisite for your completion.

That said, I'd still want the department to wake up though.
Better facilities and less controversial professors, more availability and a nicer environment...

But until you see that what's enabling them to teach architecture ""the wrong way"", which is that people are still blindly signing up for it, you will see that they have no reason to change things.

356,"In response to post #71999, I am quite astonished – and strongly disagree with – your stance. I, too, am an archi student and I will like to point out that the department has made actual, concrete steps to alleviate our clashing deadlines. 

As a Y2 student, I must say that this semester has been really much better, in terms of workload, as compared to the previous semesters. Take for example AR2221 – its essay submissions and tutorial preparations have been carefully scheduled and spaced out such that we have ample time to put sole effort into them, such as the one entire free week set aside after final crits for us to write it. And that is already excluding the fact our tutorial preparations have already helped us to engage in the preliminaries of our essays. Another example will be AR2524 – its weekly deadlines on Sunday, 6pm ensures that we are able to at least spend some time engaging meaningfully with it. The final submission for it was also well-planned and spaced out; its deadline was a good 3 weeks before final crits and I am pretty sure such an arrangement is better than having it nearer finals. To add on, for our Interim 1, AR2524 lecture was cancelled (by the lecturer’s and presumably DOA’s initiatives), as well as us being given an extra week to complete the weekly submission, just so that we could focus on AR2101 Interim. I can’t say for sure if you or the other years have experienced such good planning this sem (definitely a huge improvement from last year and even then, DOA acceded without hesitation to shift our deadlines), but considering the initiative towards good scheduling this sem for us Y2s, its quite safe to say that the lower and upper years should be experiencing the same too.  

In light of this, I implore you to reconsider your stance. Sure, the email may have been edited and resent, but as my senior said, the previous anonymous email had a clerical error which forgot to mention the prof’s name. So the prof sent it again, this time edited to ensure that when more people read it, it would resonate with them. Of course, perhaps the new email could have mentioned briefly that it was a follow up of the previous email, just as a signpost to avoid people like you who may misread and misunderstand the prof’s intentions. Yet, with the pretty harsh words you and some of the other posts used, surely such a careless omission of signposting in the new email can be forgiven, since the email was intended to address the immediacy of the situation?

To the rest of my fellow Y2s and the other years as well, I hope that we can acknowledge the fact that DOA has indeed put in effort to mitigate clashing deadlines without us students having to point them out. These initiatives were already being communicated to us at the start of the sem during the intro lectures, and I cannot help it if those who missed these lectures or skipped them continue to think otherwise. Likewise, those who are unable to manage your time properly and leave preparations to the last minute, I urge you to cultivate this skill now, lest you go out into the workforce and make such a blunder again in biting back at the very hands that fed you. 

Do not take advantage of what has been already been provided for you. All the best for final crits.

PS: Im a Y2 student and not a staff of DOA, jic someone wants to flame me for my support towards DOA’s initiatives this sem.

We’re one of the top 10 universities for pursuing architecture, and yet we have to put up with the studio conditions and a serious lack of facilities. I believe that the department of architecture has done their job in fight for us, but that just means that the university isn’t. We are paying our schools fees too, so let’s not talk about lowering our expectations and let us expect the facilities that we deserve. Yes we do have good tutors and perhaps leaders in the department, but that’s clearly not enough for anything to be done from the university level. If we are really one of the top 10 universities for architecture, then please provide us facilities that are comparable to the other top universities, and not just show us a number to make us feel better about ourselves.

The reason I say she is 'abnormally normal' is because other friends who have also been through a break up would either confide in me or rant about their ex without me asking, but as for her case, she functions absolutely normally. If I were to nitpick on her behavior, she laughs and smiles even more, talks even more, and she has a totally different vibe and I'm worried she is just putting up a facade so that people won't be worried.  Furthermore, I can see her puffy eyes even with those makeup. Whenever I asks if she is ok, she just shrugs it off casually. Or if I were to bring up the topic, she changes it immediately. I've been friends with her for 9 years and I know that she treats this relationship very seriously, and she has always been the kind who likes bottling up her feelings.

Most of my close friends from Poly/Army either went to NTU/SMU/SUSS or are now out in the workforce, so didn’t have any close friends coming to NUS with me.

I do stay on campus, and I did join CCA’s to make friends, but it always feels like there’s a distance between me and most people here. Especially as I do not come from JC, I don’t even have an O level cert, as I was from Normal Acad. Furthermore, in Army I was just a trooper, not even a Spec/Occifer like most guys here, so even then it can be hard to relate.

Maybe it’s because I come from a low background, it’s hard to become close with people here? Just don’t know, maybe the problem is with me.

362,"I am an NUS Architecture student too. I would like to point out the recent slew of emails sent by the Department of Architecture reminding us to keep in mind our personal well-being. In essence, these emails were sent to “show us care and concern”, admittedly in a knee-jerk response to the recent rants about the Architecture student life at NUS.

I would just like to ask the Department, how sincere are you in these apparent signs of “care and concern”? Throughout my course of study so far, I have never once seen emails like these which remind us to take care of our health. The most recent email, by a Professor herself, seems very comforting to read AT FIRST GLANCE. But, I realised that the email was just a copied, pasted and edited email which was sent much earlier. How sincere can that get?

We architecture students are already putting in our best efforts in juggling work and health. We do not need your insincere, knee-jerk and tokenistic emails to start doing so. If you are really sincere, these emails would have been put into actual action. Sometimes, I wonder, when we are being touted for the need to walk the talk as architects, is the Department setting a good example?

I am sure many of my fellow course mates agree that reading these emails that only serve to cover the Department’s heads amid the recent fall-out incidents in studio is all the more agitating, given that we are in the midst of our final leg for finals and yet we have to read these seemingly comforting but in reality pretentious words of care and concern. This last leg is arguably the most intense part of any archi student’s semester, where we just want to focus now on producing work that echoes the best of our project’s design.

(We also hope that this hard work and sleepless nights will greatly satisfy the jury panel on the final Crit days, even if at the expense of our health and wellbeing. After all, we are being marketed as (non)humans who do not need to eat, sleep and shit.)

363,"A letter to an unrepentant sibling: 

How do you change somebody when they are unreceptive of feedback? I’ve officially given up communicating with a sibling of mine, because talking about simple issues can get me emotionally hurt and distressed, and I don’t think I deserve such emotional punishment. Giving feedback to another sibling never ends well, so I’ve given up - I’ve got my mental health and sanity to protect. 

PS: I’m not the perfect sibling or human being, but I just want to address the distress, and get it off my chest.

Dear XX, 

You have been the cause of my emotional turmoil for many occasions in my life. The fact that I have to write this letter instead of talking to you face-to-face, shows how much I detest in-person confrontations with you. It’s also a testament to how talking to you in person does not work out, because what often begins as a simple feedback regarding your behaviour, ends up as a very uncomfortable argument. Not only do we fail to reach an agreement on what we can compromise - interactions with you end off with a bitter taste, which only makes me regret having brought up the issue with you. 

When presented with feedback, even in the most polite way, you only respond with an extreme level of self-defensiveness, spite, and a vengeance to inflict emotional discomfort on me. For someone working in a sector of providing care and support, you seem to be very skilled and inclined towards inflicting pain on others. When you’re caught in a distressing situation, it appears to me that you have to drag others down into an emotional turmoil as well - and you deliver this through your words, actions, and even tone. You’re really a master at making others emotionally uncomfortable. 

I have completely lost trust in the way you handle feedback, and even as I write this, I expect the worst reaction from you if you ever read this letter. You really have zero capacity to process feedback without having the need to make me miserable. In fact, I’ve thought of writing this letter and leaving it at your desk before I fly off - but knowing your spiteful nature, I can expect a nasty phone call or message from you while I’m on a holiday, and I don’t wish to risk that. That’s the impression I have of you. And that’s exactly the nasty things which I can expect from a resentful person like you.

Why is it so hard for you to practice mindfulness, and watch your tone when you disagree with me? I’m perfectly okay if you speak up for yourself when I call you out on certain behaviours, but there’s no need for you to use such a bitter, resentful and spiteful tone. I think you’re really out to hurt others.

I honestly think you need help for the sense of resentment that’s built up inside you. You have no capacity to repent, or think from the shoes of others. You have zero mindfulness or consideration for other people’s feelings, because you’re too busy dishing out yours.

I can recall the times when conversations with you have left me extremely uncomfortable. Perhaps it was the way you snapped at me when I politely told you that you could be rude at times. Remember that time you yelled at me because I implied that you might stretch out my clothes? I lost my appetite for dinner that day, even though my favourite noodle dish was being cooked. 

That’s the kind of impact you have on me. 

I look back on my life, and thought of all the times you’ve snapped at me, and treated me rudely. Not only did you want to convey your unhappiness (which is perfectly fine), you wanted to make me feel bad. That’s very, very petty and vengeful of you. And you wonder why I don’t share details of my life with you. 

I wish I could snap back, and impose on you the exact kind of misery that you’ve inflicted on me. But that would just make my life super miserable. I appreciate having a peaceful home. So I guess emotionally blocking you out, and staying indifferent is the best way to protect my sanity now. You need to seek help for your resentment issues. Even the family is afraid of your temper. It’s not that they condone your behavior - they just don’t want to face your temper. I guess it’s left with me to speak up for myself.

I’m sorry for the stressful life you have, and the nasty comments you get from our relatives who compare between the both of us. But you should really be mindful of the impact your words have on others. All I ask for is a peaceful home, where I don’t have to panic when I brush my teeth, fearing you might start pounding angrily on the bathroom door. I think it’s perfectly fine if you call me out for using the bathroom too long, but you don’t have to be rude about it. 

I’ve have enough anxiety in my life, I could do without having a source of negative energy at home. 

Thanks, 
Your very emotionally distressed sibling

Personally I prefer street smart, no offense or bias. Just my personal opinion. Don't be too easily offended else I slap your face with a raw octopus plus some wasabi

371,"Hellu, another NUS Architecture student here, come to share my opinions on this tsunami of a lifestyle we get swept up in. I don’t claim to speak for other Architecture students’ lives and thoughts on this, but I hope my two cents here goes a long way.
On my way home today, I saw an old man. He stood next to a swing for a long while, then sat on it and swung, having the time of his life. I thought to myself, “When was the last time I felt carefree enough to do that?”
As Archi students, our lives and minds are consumed by the work that we do, the never-ending “Project”. Even as I write this, I’m thinking, “How much time is this taking away from my design work?” We push aside issues that most would consider critical to functioning in human society, like politics, socialization, spirituality, and mental well-being just so that we can produce the best spaces for others to live their best lives in. Ironic, isn’t it, that the people who design for other people barely even live like people anymore. 
Some who read this may think, “Oh, these people are just complaining because they lack the rigor to succeed in this profession.” But I think deep down, even the most successful of architects have paid a deep price in their lives to be able to create for the human race. This doesn’t get better when we say to people,” Aki siong ah, wa die lah!”, “Aiya, Aki no life one la!” When we do this, we are trivializing the pains that we go through, turning it into a reputation and a twisted badge of honor to have “survived” Architecture, and people might just assume, after encountering this vicious self-denial we should be able to take this kind of pain forever.
Architects really do put a lot of thought into everything that they create, making damn sure that the people who use the spaces they create enjoy and benefit in ways they might not even realize. For all the non-Architecture students who see this post, the next time you walk into a building that you like going to, try to notice and think about what the architect might have done to make your life within comfortable, your experience enjoyable, and make you come back time after time, just because you “like the place”. For all the Archi students who happen to look up from your models and butter papers to see this, take a little break. Go for a run. Talk to a friend. Go have dinner. Write a weird rant essay like me. Remember to live. Remember you’re a person too.

374,"Coming to NUS has only made me realize how little I have achieved in my own life.

I've never been part of the typical NUS crowd, where a large majority come from well-to-do families, with an elite JC education. I took the long road to get here, which only compounds the fact that I struggle to feel like I belong here. Everyone around me seems to be achieving so much, but I myself, put in so much effort only to see how little I accomplish. Instagram and LinkedIn continue to torture me, because all I see is how others are performing so much better. They have great jobs/internships, a supportive partner, whilst I am left putting 100% in my work only to realize that I will never amount to my peers.
How do some people have it all? Is this what they mean when they say life is in unfair? I always thought that a person gets what he/she puts in, but I'm starting to think that it's a hopeless endeavour. When you're not academically gifted, you soon realize that trying to succeed is an impossible task. With a low CAP, you lose out at internships and jobs. I don't think anyone understands where I'm coming from, because they have never had to deal with such failure in their life. My friends have always told me to be happy and comfortable with my own journey, but how can you be satisfied when your reality tells you that you are the bottom of the social ladder?
My confidence and belief in myself have really taken a hit since enrolling into NUS. It’s a great environment to push yourself, but sadly, I think I will never amount to the calibre of some individuals here. How can I be proud of what I have accomplished (or lack thereof) when it’s plain and simple for the world to see that others are so much better?
Sorry if I'm sounding like an envious bitch, but really, I'm so jealous. I'm so tired and drained of pretending that I'm happy when deep down, all I can think about is how far I fall short of these standards and expectations. It hurts to know that you will never be good enough for some things in life, or even people.

I have been through many things in life- tumultuous childhood, family problems, physical/emotional/sexual abuse, financial difficulties etc. Nevertheless, despite all the sufferings inflicted by others, I always believe in showing grace towards others. But recently, I am very bothered by the spirit of unforgiveness enshrouding this nation. Seriously, what in the world have we become? Nowadays, I abhor going online and reading all negative comments by bloodthirsty naysayers. It appears to me that we are regressing back to the medieval times where stoning and crucifixion are a common sight and I thought that we are a modern society. Shouldn’t there be more rehabilitative measures? One should not push others to the edge unless one is hoping that there will be more pathological suicide attacks. And if anything bad should happen, remember that you reap what you sow. Unforgiveness breeds a multiplicity of man-made disasters.

Some girls have even expressed interest in me and have asked me out before. 

But I have rejected every single one of them. 
Because frankly, I'm attracted to anime girls. 

When i was a younger, i was fat and ugly and socially awkward. Girls wouldn't even give me a second look. My romance life was practically non existent.  I found solace in anime girls. Admittedly, they gave me a false sense of affection (They can't reject you if they don't exist right?) and have been there to fill the void in my heart. 

Fast forward to the present day, i simply can not find a girl that makes me feel the same amount of love and affection towards my 2D waifus. It's not that i don't want top date a 3D girl , it's just that i feel like it's a downgrade in a sense?

379,"To OP of 71717, 
I feel you. I too come from a family where I too feel that my parents were overprotective and I have never travelled overseas without my parents until the opportunity came up in NS as well. 
I would encourage you to go with the exercise as it really is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I too was happy that I got the opportunity to do so during my time in NS. While I framed it as an obligation to my parents then, I was more than happy to go for the detachment.
That being said, I think that as parents, they want the best of us and so they do not hope for us to come to any form of harm. So I think the best way to convince your parents is to assure them of your safety. The things you should tell them are: 

Firstly, you will be safe since you will be travelling in a group and that you will be looked out for by your fellow members of the group. 

Also, you will still be able to contact them to assure them of your safety. Not sure if your parents will demand that you call back or what but I think that it is still good to re-assure your parents by calling back every once in a while. However, you should make it clear that you may not be able to call back all the time or every day. 

You should also go and find out about a possible point of contact that your parents can contact you in case of emergency should anything happen back here. Each unit should have this number when they go for detachment. However, do make it clear to your parents that this is only for emergency uses. 

I think that more important than convincing your parents through reason, you should work on convincing your parents through action to show that you are ready to transition into someone that no need that much of their protection. For me, that meant helping out with some things in the household. 

Also, if you think about it, your going on a detachment could be further proof to your parents that you are no longer the kid that they think you were and who knows, probably they may relent on future instances where you need to go overseas. 

The thing is to get them to realise that you cannot be staying within the confines of their protection all the time. There will come a time where they need to let you go your way and they need to understand this as well. Give them time to be aware of this. 

Lastly, be patient and don’t think so negatively of your parents. I was once frustrated about how my parents were restrictive and at times felt suffocated (metaphorically) by them as well. 

However, I have since realised that the way every parent loves their children is different and learnt to focus on the positive things instead of the negative. After all, they are humans too and they too make mistakes. At each point in time, you are learning and growing and so are they. 

While I may not agree with them on certain things even till today, I am appreciative of all that they have done to raise me to who I am today. That does not mean that I have given up on the things that I do not agree with them on. I still try to voice my disagreements from time to time, but do it in a more respectful tone now. So stay strong and all the best????

Someone told me I needed to stop hanging around with guys and start hanging out with more girls. They are right.

I like having conversations but I feel like people are always talking about things that don't matter in life.

The issue is, most girls I met before, really only cared about guys or for some of my other girl friends, they preferred romance novels over hanging out with people, anytime of the day. When I start to be more openminded around girls (I hug people a lot) the more they start thinking I'm like a lesbian. I'm actually very straight. It's so restraining and confusing...

I would like to read your take on the following rant, that a so called ethics ""professor"", at NUS spammed his students with just a while ago:
""Dear students

Some of you have complained that your ""friends"" who did not do any appeals are scoring better than you who did the appeals. And you think that's unfair. But you would be mistaken, because you're actually not seeing all the data. We, the teaching team, have that data.

In Week 13, we will show you the data. In the data, we will be able to show you that the students who have constantly gotten snapped, and worked hard to recover from those snaps through the appeals, are the ones currently at the top of the table (right now!). We can't fake these things, it's all in the data.

So, if you got snapped, but your score is the same or less than someone who did not get snapped, then, it is not because it is unfair, it is because you are not good enough. As we will show, the students who are good enough have gotten back more than anyone else, therefore they are at the top of the table. As they should be, because they are just that good, and shouldn't we reward students who have spent the effort, and have really gotten good?

The data always tells the story.

So, get good. Or not, your choice.""

dunno about you guys, but calling anyone ""not good enough"" because of a couple of assignments, seems unethical, unprofessional, and just plain crazy to me. this guy needs to take an ethics class himself, and then check himself into IMH.

You see, she isn't exactly independent and is rather reliant on her family for many things. Lucky for her, her family is well to do and the community around their Balmoral condo gives her a sheltered but happy bubble to live in. She has made known her desire to stay near her parents after marriage many times.

Yet, I am of the more independent sort and would rather we live away from both of our parents. Even though both of our parents are rich enough to buy us a condo, I would rather we use our own money (not much on her part since her job isn't very high paying) and get a nice cosy BTO. Her parents agree with me, but my gf doesn't. When I told her about applying for the Bishan BTOs that were mentioned in the news this week, she kicked up a fuss about how that would be so far away from her friends living in Balmoral and Bukit Timah. She was also daunted by the prospect of leaving her current sheltered bubble, which was exactly the reason why her parents and I think we should get a BTO. After all, she isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer when it comes to dealing with people outside her sheltered bubble.

Needless to say, this housing issue is causing a strain in our relationship. She has also hinted that staying in a BTO is a line in the sand for her. After much persuasion, she was open to the idea of living in Bishan or somewhere equally convenient, but she insists on it being at least a condo. I love her very much, but I am afraid I am at my wits end dealing with her princess syndrome. Is there any way I can resolve this problem without jeopardising our relationship?

My results weren’t superb (& it was quite bad tbh) so whenever I applied for jobs that requires me to enter my University results, I would get eliminated even before I had the chance to go for an interview. I didn’t have the luxury of being a full time student. I need to work for my own allowances and school fees. But I know it’s not an excuse for not doing well.

On the outside, I seemed like a happy go lucky person but I guess no one will know how I truly feel. Doesn’t help when my family members keep asking me if I’ve gotten a job...... I am trying, really.

I had a friend who committed suicide recently because he couldn’t take adulthood. He lost it. When he landed his first job and he didn’t do well plus all the failed relationships he had along the way that sort of ruined him. Everything, literally everything just engulfed him at one shot. 

Don’t worry, I won’t give up on life. But I just want to shout to everyone who’s feeling down, disappointed or dejected - things will get better! It certainly will. Not now but eventually it will be better. Don’t give up on life. Think of your family, your friends and people whom you love. If you really feel like there’s no one worth living in the world for - live for yourself.

As a follow up to a previous post, I just wanted to say that I was very surprised with Singaporeans. I've been in different parts of Asia and usually really like the people, but here is different. Some people are so rude! In some stores you say hello and they don't even answer, no thank you either. This has happened more times in a few months here than ever before for me. In class, students constantly arrive late and leave early, talk and eat loudly, sleep right in front of the professor. Some will snort extremely loudly for one hour! I mean just go blow your nose... I don't know if this is a cultural clash or if i've been very unlucky. I've of course met some nice locals, but the whole culture seems a little bit oppressive. A lot of people will blindly follow orders/instructions even when it literally makes no sense. And everything here is always about work! Students do sports because they think it will look good on their CV, they always talk about school. When you go to nightclubs the locals usually don't even dance, they just go to buy bottles and show off. Even the relationships here sound transactional (why are Singaporeans so obsessed with concepts like FWBs?).
Anyway, to sum up, you guys are obviously very organized and hard-working but you could gain a lot (especially for mental health) by working on creativity, relaxation and spontaneity.

I fell in love, and so did he. He was straightforward when confessing his feelings, and I was blown off my feet not knowing what to expect in my first relationship; because of our age gap we hid our relationship. We could only meet in his home, or drive around aimlessly, & what else can you do in these places....

This went on for a year until i found out that i was a third party. I was shocked, and betrayed, but mostly found fault in myself for being so gullible to a man’s sweet talk.  

I avoided him for weeks but my determination to stay away wavered as he confessed that he was out of love with her - and only stayed due to her suicidal tendencies. Well, who am i to stop someone in a situation like this? Yet my heart still longs for him. 

It didn’t help that we still met occasionally due to mutual friends. In the silence and distance, i would still grab his hand whenever he holds it out to me. A cycle of attraction, guilt and heartbreak - at least for me. 

At the back of my mind, i was always suspicious of his real intentions. Was he lying to me? Was i being used? How many more secret relationships is he hiding?

Eventually i couldn’t take this overthinking and completely shut him off my life - even after a year, when he reached out to say he has finally been freed from his relationship. 

Not long after, our mutual friends told me that he wasn’t ok, almost depressed even, and they didn’t know why. All this while, i didn’t dare believe that it was because i left - because he had so much going on for him, and i really didn’t feel like i was much of a priority in his busy schedule. 

This all happened a few years back. I’ve mostly moved on but once in a blue moon, certain events still trigger memories and erupt unpleasant uncertainties in myself. I guess i never got the closure i needed, nor know for sure if my first love was an unfortunate love story or a miserable lie. Maybe the worst part is, i could never breathe a word about this to anyone i know. 

I have zero intent of getting back together, yet i don’t know why this bugs me so much... genuine thoughts & advice appreciated.

I feel like my sister is the one pulling the strings. My parents favour her more and would even seek advice from her.

I don’t know why she’s doing this but recently she has been talking about BTO and hinting my parents to pay for her, so maybe that’s why. Once she asked me what I thought about her fiancé and I asked her why. She said it’s because he will become a part of the family in the future and have a bigger standing (my sister is older than me) than me and my girlfriend. 

Honestly I couldn’t take it anymore a few months back and have tried to avoid contact with them. Me treating them well will only backfire. I would give them 1 word replies and no longer buy stuff for them or bring them out. My mom is the only one who cares about me and asked me why I changed but I didn’t tell her. I think my father and sister noticed but they haven’t done anything. So far I feel that it’s better this way for my mental health.

Since then it has been four great years. We both recently graduated this May and have just about embarked on our careers now. Of course with beginning real adult life comes all the usual considerations about moving in together, how and when to start a family given our circumstances, where to have our wedding outside of Singapore, etc.

I guess the honeymoon period is over of course and now is the time when real considerations take over. Like S. is Muslim and I'm Catholic, so any kids we are able to raise eventually we'll have to think hard about how to educate them on religion. We both also have different countries in mind that we want to emigrate our to-be family to eventually...we'v'e debated this for years and argued about it many times with no conclusion.

I really love him but lately it just seems like all these problems are stacking up one after another. I think the biggest wedge issue at the moment is that he really wants me to convert to his faith. I've not been super devout in recent years (long story) and I'm almost willing to convert just to be with him, because he means that much to me. There's just one problem: I'd have to cut my manhood. You know as it's sort of part of the rules. And I'm not sure if I can through with all that, and how much compromise I'm willing to make. Compromise after compromise until when?

403,"How do I deal with really toxic family members? Should I just ignore them or fight back? 

There was once my father saw a credit card transaction from amazon that he did not do. So he asked me seriously if I was the one who used his card without his permission. I said no but he still doubted me. In the end it was an unauthorised use by some scammers so the card was canceled. Another time I bought snacks from overseas for my family but they were not happy with me because they didn’t like it. He would call me useless from time to time for minors things too. 

Once I bought shirts and shoes from e-mart for my parents. Then my sister said to me in front of everyone that it wasn’t my own money. Another time my gf put her showering stuff in my house and my sister scolded me like mad saying she shouldn’t do that. Another time I left some food for my parents and sister after eating dinner (home cooked) and my sister scolded me for being lazy to wash the plates. Like wtf...She would often talk bad about me to my parents behind my back and scold me for nothing. 

I really hate this toxic family and can’t wait to move out...

When are you gonna stop being ambiguous? Just laughing it off? Is this what you are gonna do everyday? Please do something cos I really can’t stop loving you. Or maybe I just give up, is something that went through my mind for several nights.

But I’m unable to. My eyes can’t shift away from you. Whenever I try to strike a conversation to figure out how you really feel, you pass it off as a joke. In the end, I simply made you listen to useless stuff and I let you leave with a smile.

As someone who values their privacy & freedom I'm not on social media but it seems like one gets completely cut off from any happenings or social circle. Singaporeans are such a reserved,constantly irritated and boring lot. They dont even bother to say hi to their neighbours. The Chinese are busy studying all the time and happy with not being integrated. Most girls(any ethnicity) are so meek they'd rather drown in their own ocean of fear than take the risk of approaching someone they like. Going out to clubs or tinder is so passe and a loser's game for a guy and organizing events constantly requires some or the other permission. A movie night at utown requires a licence! Flat parties are only held by the exchangers because everyone else is too afraid or busy on instagram. No one has any fun here! Pff, singapore is BORING! Would never recommend anyone to come here unless all they want from life is endless shopping malls and banal simple-minded consumerist pleasures.

He said the campus provided a testing ground for the team to see how far they could “push the limits of safety” (direct quote from The Ridge). I am very concerned to hear this. Instead of looking out for our safety as they pretended to do with the road shows, they are actually trying to push our limits which resulted in people falling over and getting injured. So Grab is admitting to using us as guinea pigs? This should be investigated.

There is also no point giving extra credit for students to do more ""optional"" post-tutorial forum post. This only makes it compulsory because everyone ended up doing it (nash equilibrium?).
Forum post are graded so strictly and there are so many to do. Eg we only write one reflection paper in FAS1102 (500 words) for 10% of the module but for GET1050 its 3 post-tutorial forum reflection post of 500 words each for 7.5% of the module and the grading is even stricter (Mean is a B-).

413,"Early last year, I met this guy through a mutual friend and we clicked instantly. Back then he just moved back to Sg after working overseas for a while, to help out with his family business. We eventually got together, and that was when he opened up more and I started noticing that I wasn’t comfortable with his lifestyle and habits. I found out that apparently he wasn’t doing much for the business and pretty much bummed around the whole day. He also spent many sleepless nights playing poker and boasted to me how his few days of earnings from poker can even exceed my monthly salary. He’s from a very rich family and basically behaved like a spoiled kid even at his age (late 20s). He bought me expensive meals and gifts but I knew it was either using his parents’ money or from gambling and it made me feel uneasy. I broke up with him after a few months for all these reasons and he was furious, as he accused me of not loving him enough to give him chance to improve before dumping him. Vicious words were exchanged, and the immature way he handled the breakup (he even threw my phone across the room) made me hate him even more. 

Few weeks after the breakup, he started contacting me again, thanking me for teaching him an important lesson despite all the hurt and he said he’s working towards becoming a better person. Soon, he shared with me that he had secured a decent job. He stopped gambling completely and spent the time working out and learning new skills instead. He sent me gifts on my birthday and souvenirs from his holiday trips. Again and again he expressed his appreciation to me for inspiring him to lead a more fulfilling life and saying how badly he wanted to see me now. However, never once did I respond to him. Even when we happened to bump into each other once and he called my name several times, I pretended not to see him. My heart was still cold remembering the spoiled kid that he used to be, I refused to believe that he indeed has changed.

Fast forward about 1.5 years to today, he still contacts me from time to time. I guess time really heals, I no longer have bad feelings for him now. In fact I felt kinda guilty for ignoring him all these while. So I was just thinking whether it’s weird if I suddenly respond to him now (he just texted again recently), apologise for my lack of response so far etc and try to be friends with him? Should I be open to the idea of starting a relationship with him all over again if he’s still keen, now that he’s a changed person? My worst fear is that he’ll go back to his old ways one day and disappoint me again, am I thinking too much here?

I’m wondering has anyone else felt like this before? I’m afraid of telling my friends or family because I know they will judge me or think I’m joking, but I’m not. It’s been really stressful trying to hide my baguette addiction from them. I almost got exposed when I brought a baguette with me everyday to my group projects, and my friends asked me what’s my problem. Since then I’ve only eaten them in secret, usually I will go to one of the toilets in BIZ1 because they’re quite private.

Anyway, I wish the cafes in school would sell baguettes! It’s really troublesome bringing one with me to school every morning, especially when the trains and busses are so crowded. Sometimes people give me a nasty look because they think I’m poking them with something, but it’s really just my bread. 

It’s really stressing me out, and I don’t know what to do about this. Should I see a doctor?

Really annoyed at how rude some of them can be. Pity for those who had to live a life with these insufferable buffoons (F to pay respect our brothers and sisters that have endured hell). 

Yes I know not all old folks are like this. And it is not always the case that they are entitled or are screwed up people. Some could have just been in a bad mood that day, we never know their stories. There is still a portion out there who are just pure asshats and I'm glad time isn't on their side. Just sucks that my taxes is going to fund their social services or nonsense packages that further fuels egoistic entitlement (bloody hell, each and every generation thereafter is going to expect some sweet juicy deeds and the burden of funding it lies with us), their only contribution to society was to just show us how much of a mistake they are (Why did the ancestors not pull out? Durex commercials should also show these dingbats as reason why condom is encouraged instead of just bratty children). Don't pull the ""older generation plants the tree, younger generation gets the shade"" argument. Some of these entitled pricks did jack for society. Not all old folks are entitled and not all old folks made positive contributions.

Again, i'm not referring to all old people, just the really entitled dingoes. There's many out there that deserves so much more help and it just sucks that these bloody mops are making a bad name of others. We should not excuse their rude behaviour and should actively call them out.

I will tell my father to let me practise driving his car but he will be reluctant as his car is like his treasure and he says my driving skills isn’t good enough yet. Obviously I want to drive to improve my driving skills as I’m bad at it, but it’s because he barely even lets me practise due to me not being good enough...so it’s an endless cycle. 

And my father is always worried about me and my family travelling overseas even though I’m a guy. I wanted to go to London for summer school but he advised me not to go as it was dangerous. Same for my exchange in Australia. My family was planning to go to Phuket for holiday but he saw a news about a boat accident somewhere in Philippines. He was worried so we canceled the trip. I know he’s concerned about our safety but like that might as well forever stay in Singapore, don’t go anywhere...

And I wanted to learn to cook too but my grandma doesn’t like others using the kitchen. Eventually I did cook but my grandma wasn’t happy about it. And yet sometimes she will say I don’t know how to do a lot of things like cooking...

Soon we didn't even go out, usually straight to her house (she lives alone with her aunt, I am still living with my parents). Long story short, I had the intention of proposing to her to be my girlfriend. Age is just a number though. Just when I am having such thought, she asked, ""do I mind if her aunt join in"", in one of our ""sessions.""

Often, she would squeeze it and threaten to throw it out the window because it looks “ugly”. One time, she even threatened me and asked me to choose between her and the turtle. Calling it names, physically abusing it and everything she does towards it ignited a strange sort of rage in me and one time, I even contemplated hitting her.

Then one fine day when I checked my telegram, she blocked me. And I forgot about this whole incident till I saw a familiar face on instagram. It was the girl and her boyfriend. And I knew the guy.

And worse, some don't believe that what I have accomplished is real. They think it must be from my parents, although they have never given me a cent of money after graduation, only true love and affection and discipline.

I strongly encourage any freshmen sitting on the fence on this matter to sign up for any of the numerous recruitment drives happening now I promise it will be memorable for better or for worse :)

Actually frankly speaking, that girl I date, she is looking for the same thing like me. Someone that loves her for life and not just for sex. She is way more traditional than I thought 

Only if she has really seen me someone she wanted to be for life and not just her money tree, I am willing to accept her. Despite I sit with her for so many months, I still did not get this trust for her that I wanted her just for sex 

Anyway, she has gone back to Thailand but my stance and feelings has never changed at all. If she can be more openly trusting to me and I know she do cares for ppl, my time spent with her is pretty incredible. I never used to think so much on family and on my income but eventually, I want her to see that I am serious of being with her and she can open her heart in telling me everything

I am a good boy

No more Thai disco for the rest of my life haha ????

I will be watching a movie on a Saturday and go home after that. Perhaps may catch up with some friends on weekend for a drink and listening to life music.

Would like to have your advice and inputs for my concern below.

I am interested in the UX/UI, multimedia/graphics/illustrator etc field. Is it advisable to take up a degree in Computer Science in local uni or take up a Multimedia/Graphic course etc in private uni?

As I'm not sure if the field I am interested in are suitable for me or something I would enjoy in the long run and also in terms of the availability of the job opportunities/salary. Hence I thought of studying computer science would be more advisable as it is considered general IT degree and will be able to apply to the UX/UI, multimedia/graphics/illustrator etc field too? (Please correct me if m wrong)

However if I choose to take up a multimedia/graphic course etc, if in the future I am not keen anymore or would like a career switch to other areas in IT. The degree I get might not be able to allow me to jump to other areas in IT.

I feel I am not technically as strong as I do not have a programming background and I don't think I am a fast learner. If I take up the computer science course, would it tough for me to catch up. What should I do? 

Thank you.

As a prereg, I realise that my colleagues keep talking about empowering patients and letting them take charge of their health, or something along the lines of ""we should be role models for our patients"", but all these are so hard to achieve. I mean, just look at the number of patients out there who think that they are smarter than us and challenge us with our therapy recommendations. Like I dont even see my role as a community prereg pharmacist anymore if patients continuously ignore my advice and engage in unhealthy activities. No wonder my preceptors rather use their mobile phones than talk to their patients. To be honest you all will fare better if you work elsewhere. Even better, go into other profession like selling insurance or becoming a childcare facilitator. At least the toddlers are easier to manage than the adults coming to your local pharmacy.

453,"This is going to be a long rant guys. 

We've been broken up for a few month but I feel like I didnt get any closure even though i was the one who initiated the break up. 

You live right in the prime district of singapore and I live an hour away from you. Your family is obviously well to do whereas mine live in a 3 room flat. When we got together after a few months you visited my place and called it gross. Obviously I felt sad and inferior, but I brushed it off because I thought to myself, yes it's gross compared to yours. So I'm always the one who goes over to your place, staying over the weekend etc. You always wanted me to stay over friday through monday. I felt suffocated after the honeymoon period and asked that I have Sunday to myself, you got angry. Throughout the 3 years of the relationship you've only visited my place less than 5 times. When I told you sometimes it's tiring travelling from home to school and all, maybe you could come over instead, you straight out tell me no and if I feel unfair, I dont have to go over to your place anymore. It sounded like you were threatening to break up. So I sucked it up. 

We both have dogs, yours is a pure breed with some sort of certification whereas mine is a mongrel that I adopted. Whenever you walk your dog, if there's someone walking a mongrel you will say things like ""eww. Better not come near my dog"". Your parents once commented during a family dinner at home that ""stray dogs should just be shot dead in the streets"". You all laughed it off and I got so angry with that comment that I had to leave the table and cut the dinner short. When I told you how I felt you just said ""so?"". Is it an elitist thing? That only pure breed dogs like yours deserve to live? 

You are extremely calculative. When we would go out to dinner, you split the bill down to every cent. When I dont have enough cash, you would remind me ""hey don't forget you still owe me $1.20"". Not that I'm gold digging but you constantly reminding me makes me feel like I'm trying to cheat your money which I'm not. Sometimes when we over order and I really cannot eat anymore, you will say things like ""eh this dish very expensive, you better finish it"". Which honestly made me very uncomfortable. 

You are spoilt, rude and selfish. My parents aren't rich but they do the best they can for me. Sure, I had to work part time and take out a student loan for my education just like most singaporeans. You told me my parents shouldn't even have kids if they cannot afford basic things like education. That hurt. When expensive things break down in the house such as tv/refrigerator, I will fork out some money to lighten the load for my parents. You got angry and told me I shouldn't have done that, it is not my responsibility and I should save the money instead. 

You constantly find things to fight about. You dont let me hang out with my friends just because they have a different political view. You criticise the people and things I care about. When you found out sometimes I donate money to SPCA or SOSD (small amounts), you scolded me. Said we use the money to travel better.

We are completely different and I know the break up was the right decision. 

I guess this post was my very indirect way of spilling everything out to you and to air my grievances.

It has happened a few times so I've already made it clear to them that if I'm upset, I'll tell them - but normally if my rbf shows, it's because I'm genuinely exhausted. But it is still happening and I get the feeling that they are genuinely afraid of me. It annoys me that my friends (of three years) still feels and acts that way around me, but I literally have no idea what to do.

Ok it's your freedom if you want to smoke but can you at least smoke somewhere else, definitely not in front of the ""no smoking"" signs, so that you don't harm the health of others? I've wanted to take pictures of those smokers and report to authorities many times but decided not to be a ""busybody"" and ""mind my own business"" in the end. But maybe someday I will actually report these people when I cannot stand it. It's your business that you smoke but it's my business when my health is affected. So if you reading this, dear smokers, make sure you are extra careful that no one is beside you when you smoke, because I'll be waiting to report you.

Can the authorities also do something about this? (Aside from placing signboards because it is not working) Maybe install a CCTV (if there is currently none) and do random checks occasionally. Your help is much appreciated.

So I've been going my own way for some time and randomly a friend of my whom recently got into a relationship with a girl he met in school asked if I was in a relationship. I told him I wasn't and am not intending to.

He immediately jumped out of laughter and said, ""more like you couldn't get any."" I was left baffled by his statement and asked why so?

He said, ""I've known you for 3 years and the reason you are not in a relationship is because you couldn't get any."" I'm by no means ugly. In fact I have a 6 pack whislt he has a dad bod.

And he's been with her for less than a month. He would literally skip lunch or even have 2-5 minutes to eat his lunch just to send his girlfriend back home from school and go back to school again (different timetables). And this idiot would go great lengths to spend all the money with her on food and she ate a few bites before telling him she doesn't feel hungry.

That's not all, they act as if they are a married couple by having to lecture each other on the time they reached home. She got pissed with him for reaching home late because she wasn't able to video call him. Sick cunt.

This was just one instance of simps acting like white knights and putting me down. Another guy from my class laughed at me for spending time alone on outside because I was a lonely loser with no girlfriend. The guys girlfriend posted a pic of her and another guy on her social media claiming the other guys gay but we all know what's she's been doing behind his bad. And to top it off, the girl never posted any pictures of the them on her social media but posted pictures with different guys on it. Not sure what kind of exclusivity this is.

Just to conclude, why do men like these choose to put someone down just because he's not dating or doing his own things? What do they have to gain by putting men like me down?

I think I have come to the point of giving up hope on ""friend"". Whenever I trusted them, they will simply destroy my trust. 

Let's name two of my ""close friend"" C and K. I had known C since young and our parents are very good friends as well. I told C a secret and mentioned not to tell anyone because it is not the time to reveal the secret yet. C agreed to it. However, C decided to tell another person, eventually the news came to my ears. I was shock and devastated at that time to hear such news. The thought of all the trust I have on C simply shattered at that moment. 

While K, we had known each other close to 10 years. I would say I am closer to K as compared to C as we usually interact more since we had quite a lot of common interest. Recently K's birthday is around the corner and since it is K's 21st birthday, I decided to make it something special as a birthday gift. Hence, I did a handmade birthday gift which I had never made one before. With my excitement, I went to Art Friend shop and spent more than an hour to think of how am I going to make a gift out of it (ps I am not an artistic person). Yet, I received a long message from K about K's disappointment in the handmade gift. K feel that I did not put in much effort despite thoughts that count. But to me, it gives me the vibes that K spent more money to buy my birthday gift as compared to what I gave to K hence K is disappointed. On top of that, K even mentioned that I did not spend the time to consider what K would like to have or able to use. K said that regarding my birthday gift, K had spend time to consider what would be useful for me, which to be honest, it is not practical for me. However, I appreciate the thought of K buying it for me and did not said anything. 

Other than those 2 ""close friends"" I have mentioned, I have also experienced abandonment and betrayal from other ""friends"" as well. Is it common to have these kind of friends in the society now? Friends that see benefits in you but once you no longer value, they simply throw you away...

466,"I was asked point blank if I was gay by a long-time straight friend after some drinks in front of a large group. Being still in the closet, and especially with such a large group I laughed it off and denied it. I don't blame him, alcohol makes it easier for people to ask personal questions. Nevertheless, I felt really uncomfortable that I couldn't give an honest answer, and I wish my friend was more sensitive with the whole affair. 

I don't think I've been flamboyant in any way, just that I've never dated a girl despite being shipped regularly, and I've always claimed being an unattractive nerd was the reason why.

I know there are those who say my true friends will stick by me after I come out, and that those in university are open minded, but I'm really scared. I'm scared of how many will actually remain, and amongst them how many will be understanding and continue to treat me same as per before. I'm sorry, but I'm not ready.

I'm scared that any new acquaintances in uni will judge me based on my sexuality over my personality. I've spoken to friends who would whisper to me in a lecture hall about how a random guy sitting a few rows in front is gay, even when I know nothing about him.

I'm scared my army buddies will run from me and see me as that guy who would add questionable stuff to their Milo.

Coming from a boys school, I'm scared that my bros of nearly a decade will see me as someone who might want to hit on them and distance themselves from me and cut off contact. I'm scared I'll no longer fit in. 

Sometimes, I know curiosity gets the better of all of us. I too, want to find out if my eye candy leans the same way. But there are different reasons between when you ask about someone's sexuality in front of a large group, versus when you ask in private. The first approach makes me feel like you just want to expose me to everyone else. But  if you want me to know that you're comfortable with who I am, there are plenty of ways to do it in private, which I think is a good way to build trust too. I won't give an honest answer either way at this stage, but it'll definitely make it alot less uncomfortable. I've always wished I could fit in and be straight like most people, but the reality is this is something I don't really have a choice over. I just hope my friends in the majority can be more understanding, and not to make it more difficult or uncomfortable for those with a different sexuality.

Furthermore, many of the jobs do not require expertise or knowledge pertaining to your degree. A recent news showed that half of Singapore grads find jobs not related to their degree. Goes to show how useless the core modules become when you graduate. Note to self: Memorize your notes, cause you can just forget it after finals.

Some may argue that you will learn soft skills, project management skills, get networks etc during your undergrad course. But you can also learn these while accumulating work experience, not to mention the salary which you can use to pamper and upgrade yourself.

Going to a JC used to be a popular choice for many of those who can. But as the gap between a diploma and bachelor cert closes (in terms of value for money from the perspective of a employer), will diploma be the new favourite? Or will fresh grads widen the gap by pursuing masters?

477,"So there has been many complaints from Engineering students regarding CS1010E mid terms being difficult.

Now you know how CS students typically feel, and why they complain on NUSWhispers; it is not because CS students are whiny, but genuinely because of the high workload and difficulty of CS modules (think Level 2/3/4/5 CS mods, CS1010 is simply introductory).

And please do not bring forth the argument that Eng students are forced to read CS1010E, a mod outside of their area of specialization. This module is tailored specifically for Eng students, and they themselves signed up for it when they enrolled into Eng, just like any other courses.

Every single time I go out, old men will look at me up and down, then stare for very long time. When I turn to stare at them, some look away, some don't. I don't wear revealing or tight clothes. Once, a man at the next table kept looking, even though his wife is sitting opposite him. When I stare at him, he started smiling. Another time, a man took video of me. I noticed it because I happened to walk over to stand behind him in the queue. But I don't dare to confront him. 

Some times I try to be ugly as possible. Unkempt hair and black baggy clothes. I don't even own any makeup. But same result.

Not only that. When standing in trains or buses, women next to me will sling their bag so hard that it hits me. Some times the path is so wide but they will walk so close and elbow me. 

It's all these triggers that builds up my anxiety and it consumed me many times. It gets so bad that I will call in sick the next day. The next thing I worry is the journey from house to clinic and back, for my mc. 

School being so far from home makes it worse. How I wish I'm rich enough to just cab everyday, so I won't face those perverts and inconsiderate people. 

Some times I just want to end it so I won't experience these anymore. But I have responsibilities to my family.

482,"This is already the period when cs1010s students get so salty and complain that the paper is too hard. Ask yourself if you did ALL the papers give. Did you practice under time conditions? Did you truly understand the answers? Or maybe you copied codes for missions I guess, so your programming skills hardly improved over the course so far. You won’t find another module that provides so many pyp for you to try out. If you knew you aren’t good in doing the papers, you would’ve practiced more, try out random code tracing problems by yourself, ask tutors, etc.

Yes, there will be those who are better cus high IQ/ started learning python before university, but these ppl make up a low percentage. It’s not like these smart people only exist in cs1010s anyway, these people exist in most modules. Even many of those who who started ahead in python struggle in cs1010s. So the point is, just put in a lot more effort if you really want your A. Else, too bad, just SU then. If you carry on with this attitude complaining about how hard the paper is, you will be suffering in the rest of your uni life.

It was pretty crowded so I shared the table with an old lady, to which I saw she was pushing her husband (I assume) in a wheelchair. From his looks it seems like the uncle had difficulty speaking. Then I went to queue at the chicken rice stall and the auntie queued at the fish soup stall beside, I then overheard this conversation in Chinese:

Auntie: “Hello, 1 fish soup please.”
Guy: “$4.50.”
Auntie: “I want rice can?”
Guy: “Auntie you want 2 rice is it?”
Auntie: “No, I meant I want the soup with rice.”
Guy: “Soup comes with rice lah.”
Auntie: “Oh okay sorry.”

Then I saw the chicken rice stall guy was laughing at their conversation. Not only was the guy taking the order quite rude, his friend was laughing. 

Don’t they realise that they’re working in a hospital where generally people don’t come here unless they have relatives or friends in need of hospital care? I mean I get that life is full of sh*t but come on have a little sensitivity, it’s not like patients visiting the hospital isn’t finding their life hard enough.

CS1010E is peanuts as compared to any other CS module right? This means I just stupid, not being able to do a simple module. What’s more, I am from a Polytechnic, meaning that I have some background knowledge in programming which is suppose be beneficial. It doesn’t help me at all despite that. That is where I came to realise that programming is something that needs to be built up with experience and practice or talent. Its either you get the logic or you don’t. 

By the way, I taking an extra major in Innovation and Design. I somehow overestimated myself that I will be able to cope. Turns out I made a stupid decision on that and I’m doing badly. I grasp concepts much slower than the others, sleeping around 3-4am almost every day and having no social life. Despite trying, I see no result, taking CS1010E, EE2026 as an example. There is literally no one I know I can relate to for the workload I have. This is where I’m starting to give up already due to the trauma caused by CS1010E mid-term.

Until I came to uni and realized I don't genuinely like anyone I meet ???? it's like I can make conversation when required of me, but it's bothersome to me. I don't have many friends that I can turn to (just a few cliques here and there), since I don't find joy in small talk and superficial hi-bye friendships, and hence hardly reach the stage of building deep relationships with them. Also, when I meet new people, I see things that I dislike in them super quickly, which makes me not even want to try to befriend them. lt doesn't even have to be a whole personal encounter for me to come to such a conclusion, a short few seconds would do. One reason could be that I think I tend to see through people's intentions very easily and hence don't fall prey to all the fakeness going around? Or maybe it's that I just don't have much love to spread around lol all exhausted on my family and bf? 

Since wide connections seem to be very important to succeed in life these days, I do often reflect on myself and wonder why I'm like this? Am I really that bad of a person?

*lengthy post ahead

I am currently a year 1 student in comp science (part-time) from a local uni. Just a rough background of myself, i came from an engineering diploma from poly, and am in my mid 20s.

Recently I have the thought of dropping out from the course and apply for an IT course in SUSS instead. Reason being: 1) it does not have maths/engineering related modules as compared to the local uni, modules were IT related. 2) local uni's workload is much more and fast-paced, bellcurve with full time students and I would say I'm generally not a fast learner. 

However the business IT course focuses on mainly a specific area of IT (The degree course is quite a niche area I guess) hence Is it advisable to go for it or would a comp science degree is better as it offers a wider range of job opportunities? Currently I do not know which area of IT I would like to dive into hence I chose Comp science degree so that it allows me to explore the various options while studying in uni. 

However recently as considering my age factor etc once I graduated from uni, would it be wiser if I take up the SUSS course instead as it allows me to build my experiences in it and also to allow myself to kinda just force to try ""grow"" interest in it?
As the modules in Comp science are quite general and by the time I graduated, I might not have the ""in-depth"" skills to allow me to build my experiences in the area I would like to dive in.

What should I do?

A: change course to the SUSS course immediately, which the sch will starts in Jan, or in July.
B: stick with current local uni course, in the meantime search job related to the suss course and work there to see if I enjoy that area of IT. (Bt this could means I will miss the Jan intake and would have to join the July intake).

Thanks all for reading!

For most part of the trip, meals were included, except for one particular lunch. The prof recommended a restaurant, and as a class we went there together. I think I’m the only one who knew of my classmate’s financial situation, and because of that I noticed that when ordering, that classmate ordered the cheapest item on the menu. Some plain fried rice which was half the price of what most people ordered, and a bottled water which was like a third the price of the other drinks we ordered. Then most of us also ordered desserts to share among our cliques. Penny pinching classmate did not order and did not share any dessert.

After the meal, the prof paid the bill and asked the class rep to collect $xx from everyone. Prof said to the class “Since everyone had a meal and a drink, and desserts to share, let’s just make it easy and divide equally, ok?” I glanced over at the penny pincher, and saw the face just fall apart and went black. It was pretty haunting. But well, no one spoke up. Class rep went around collecting money, penny pincher paid up with the darkest face I ever seen on anyone. Due to some other arrangement with my clique, a friend covered my portion of the bill so class rep didn’t approach me and I didn’t say anything to the class rep.

Today, I went to check up on how she was doing on fb and saw that she got married one month earlier??? So she met a new bf, dated, proposed and got married within the span of 10-11 months, but for our 7 year relationship she kept saying she was not ready for marriage? FWIW her new husband is older and looks richer than I am, but definitely not as handsome. Oh well.

519,"I have an issue with the new 'A Culture of Respect and Consent' mod. Throughout the course, it is evident that the course is biased in favour of female students. While I appreciate the single sentence in the beginning that mentions consent and respect should be given to all, regardless of gender, I find it disappointing that the examples provided in the scenarios are oblivious to this.

In all scenarios except the one involving the homosexual couple, why does it always portray men as the perpetrators, and women as the victims? If NUS truly wants to enshrine the idea of consent and respect, I think it wouldn't be too difficult to include just 1 scenario in which a female student asks a male student for consent.

At the end of the course, it's surprising that the course urges us to ""not support misogynist pop culture"". What about misandrist pop culture? 

Granted, the reported cases of sexual harrassment on females far outnumber that on males, but is this a fair justification to dismiss the small but existent number of male victims? I think this shows that while NUS tries to market this as a course for all, it is unconsciously biased in its portrayal of harrassment. Ultimately, it shows that society values the consent, modesty, and privacy of males much less than that of females.

I am really concerned right now, as a Y2 CS student, as I have an average cap of around 4, and no achievements. I am afraid of not being able to find a decent internship after Y2, and I am afraid that because I have nothing to stand against other students, I will not be able to find a decent job after graduation. 

How hard is it to find a job that pays around 4k after graduation for a student that is bottom-average and do not stand out?

Any tips as well to buff up my resume? I am really concerned, so sincere advice please, no troll.

My problem comes when female friends who do not know of my dirty little secret thinks they stand a chance at my heart. (I guess I'm generally known as a really sweet and nice guy). My straight male bros think that I'm a hotshot and girl-killer, but in actual fact I am checking guys out quietly instead. It breaks my heart to have to reject all these girls who come at me, but I really am genuinely only interested in being friends with them. Feels like a total Billie Ellish ""wish you were gay"" scenario and I am really gay just that I'm not ready to say.

It's such a bummer when I start a misunderstanding because what I want is a platonic friendship while they seek something romantic.

526,"With reference to post #70349, I too, am experiencing the same thing. Except that this is happening to my boyfriend. His brother has a girlfriend who literally treats my boyfriend's house as her own. My boyfriend and his brother both share a room together and she will always come in, play and sleep inside their room. Because of this, my boyfriend has to camp at his living room until she leaves the house (usually around 12-3am). She too moves furniture around and the boys had to shift everything back again after she left. Although my boyfriend and his parents are totally not fine with it, sometimes ranting to me about what she has done, they are not the confrontational type. 

One time, when my boyfriend's parents went overseas for a few days, she  came over, brought food with her boyfriend, without buying any for the youngest brother who has special condition. When my boyfriend came home from work, he saw the two of them eating in his room together while the youngest sat outside. After preparing dinner for the youngest, he told me how the youngest actually ate very quickly, something he would do when he's really hungry.  

As much as I am annoyed, I know I'm not in any position as an outsider to interfere. I could only give my opinions to my boyfriend to do something about it (since he is the oldest). But to no avail, since they are not the confrontational kind as mentioned, sigh pie. When I ask her about it, she conveniently cited the fact that she is mixed??! I'm pretty sure this is not a racial issue lol. 

Besides treating the place like her own territory, she too has something against me. EVERYTHING, I repeat, EVERYTHING is a competition to her. From studies, to achievements, even planning to get married. Lol. But that's a different story altogether, we'll just leave it at that. 

I just wish someone in that family would do something about this, when they are clearly not ok with this. Or hope that maybe she would grow up and be more considerate someday. Idk. I'm just uncomfortable with this situation.

I am a hard introvert. My current s/o keeps pressuring me about how I do not care about them. When I gave my all to them, they keep neglecting my needs or cut short my recovery/recharge by going out. I don't like going out. But when it comes to them, I have to bend and break myself to give them what they want. I do not know what to do for them anymore. I feel so exhausted and every time I get a message from her is never something good or it is something bad about me needing time alone. I am working adult and they are studying. But everytime I ask for time to rest, they sulk. My off days are always dedicated to her, my friends or my family. I do not have time for myself.

It is so bad that I begun hating myself for it. I hate my introversion and it is eating me up because it is me. I am a hard introvert. If it was not for my monetary issues, I would have stayed home and draw the whole day. 

How can make my s/o understand this? Becaude after months of explaining it, they never seems to get.

Post: Is superficiality all that matters to us ? Do girls my age just care about how good looking you are or how much money you make ? Sorry if it sounds sexist, but if that’s the case, does it mean all women are gold diggers ? Does no one care about feelings and personalities anymore ? What about finding and having a genuine relationship instead of this new hookup/“sugar daddy culture” ?   

I have friends and a loving family, but there’s always a small part in us where we crave for a human connection with someone special, a partner and that’s what I want, but it seems people my age just don’t give a damn about anything apart from looks, money and hooking up. It just seems impossible for me to find someone because I’m already further ahead in life (have a FT job which I love, no longer studying)

Because of the wedding preparations, my girlfriend has been trying to lose weight. She’s been dieting and gymming a lot that she doesn’t have time for dates. When I ask her out for dinner after work, she’d say she’s not having dinner because of her diet. When I ask her out for movies, she’d say she needs to go to the gym. She’s not fat, just a bit plump but I think she’s ok. She did lose about 20kg over the past 9 months, so I think she wants to maintain her current weight. But I feel that she’s doing a bit too much.

It also seems like she’s doing some funny gym stuff instead of like running or weights. She said she has spinning classes and silks classes every week. Like wtf are those?! I’m starting to think that she’s becoming so foreign to me and is no longer the girlfriend I once knew. I’m reconsidering if we should even get married now.

534,"Why does he love me? 

I would be fooling myself if I said, because he can appreciate my ""essential being"". Maybe that is a tad idealistic. Kind? Humorous? Beautiful? That is not unique to me, and I can easily be swapped out for someone else. 

This is the internal thought process of a non-feminist young woman in campus, who does not condone sex early on in a relationship. Kindly follow my line of reasoning. 

Repeating the question, which is very simple, 
What is the basis for his love? Because me loving him is not enough, he has to value me too, or else I won't be happy! 

Many romantics believe, love is blind, love is irrational. No wonder there is also a term such as hopeless romantic, which indicate a sense of letdown by reality. 

In most cases, the natural instinct of the opposite gender is to rush into sex, unless he is irrationally noble. There is a frenetic sexual energy at this age where nothing but biology is to blame. 

Do you love yourself, or do you seek validation from instagram likes and size of following to prove your social value based on a painstakingly curated glory hole constituting of vacation photos and perceived popularity? If that is the case, do I attribute his love to my parents for funding my life (and my phone to access instagram)? 

What is your identity? Do you believe yourself to be smart? Do you think of yourself as creative? Do you see yourself as strong? Or special in some inexplicable way? 

Does he see that? 
What tangible things do you have to show for yourself? 

Has he had many long drawn out, thoughtful discussions to know you on a mental level? No? Yeah, who has time for that anyway? We are all living alone on our own for the first time, in most cases, and we need instant remedy for our loneliness and neediness. 

To cut the long story short, we could possibly just be another random person without deep, meaningful and specific contextual relevance to them. All you have to offer him is sexual favors. That might be the reality. And you are better off abstaining than to be an unpaid worker. 

So cultivate some self-worth, individuality and focus on personal growth and achievement, rather than investing emotional energy into a gutter, through laying your insecure, eager to please/accommodating self at their mercy when they leave you feeling ""abandoned"" and worse than where you started. Ain't worth it. Save yourself the unnecessary heartache/drama.

536,"First, some background: I am an only child. My weekends are spent together with my dad and we have a close and loving relationship. On weekdays, when my dad has to work overtime, my mum would cook dinner for me. Overall, I would consider my childhood to be a happy one.

A few months ago, my dad confessed to me that he was having issues with his marriage. For obvious reasons, as his daughter, I can't directly help him. Even so, it hurts me to see him so unhappy, so I tried to indirectly help him, e.g. by organizing a family dinner in a fancy restaurant and pretending that I have some last-minute assignment so my parents can spent time together. I also advised my dad to try his best to communicate his issues with my mum in a clear and effective way. For a time, I sensed an improvement in their relationship. I was very proud of my dad and his willingness to make an effort to save his marriage. 

Unfortunately, my mum dosent share the same positive attiude. A few months ago, my mum told me that she was thinking of divorcing my dad after I graduate. I am totally disgusted by how toxic she is and how she is willing to give up her husband and daughter without putting in any effort to salvage the situation. I find it even more disgusting that she pretends to be concerned about my graduation as an excuse to guilt trip me into taking her side in the event of a divorce.

Well, guess what, we know all your tricks. We are making preparations. When the day comes, you will not get a cent out of my dad. Goodbye and good riddance.

I've just graduated last year and found a job related to my degree, receiving a salary of 4.1k, which is the average salary of people with my degree.

So, my fiancee and I have BTOed, currently waiting for our flat and our wedding ceremony will be held a year later, after she graduates from uni. Since I came from a much humbled background as compared to her, my family and I would usually take the public transport, or at most grab/rent a car on rare ocassions. Since I'm currently working with a decent salary, I've decided to purchase a car so that it would be much convenient for everyone and I can bring her out on dates more often too. However, when I told her about this plan, she doesn't seem to understand things from my POV. She mentioned that we will be spending lots of money on our new flat, wedding dinner, honeymoon, my tuition loans etc and the car would be a financial burden. Basically she hates the idea of me owning a car, despite giving in to her by choosing a cheaper car. She mentioned that owning a car in SG is equivalent to burning money away since it's COE only lasts for 10 years, hence the depreciation.

Okay, so everytime we get into this topic, she just doesn't seem to give in and we have been in this conflict for about 2 weeks. And I'm honestly so fed up. She knows that I love cars since young and owning one is my lifetime dream. I'm super lost right now, how should i convince her to let me own one?

She became cold towards me lately, even coaxing her with food doesn't help like how it does in the past. Although she doesn't ignore me, I can tell that she is very unhappy by her attitude through the phone or irl. I did not expect her to react in such a way since she grew up from a rather wealthy background and travelling by cars were her go to. But she mentioned that she didn't want her parents to support her after we get married. I really don't like to see her being unhappy, but I really want to own one car.

538,"I honestly think SMU has better control over their student than NUS. This year both NUS and SMU had their Business Orientation Camp differently. 

SMU is very concerned about their reputation and its Office of Student Affair closely collaborated with the organising committee to ensure that their students had a wholesome experience, this is given the condition that the students had the freedom to carry their phone around. They even banned games that may make the participants feel uncomfortable such as red black which may include questions that related to sexual activities. 

Unlike NUS which had it differently. Their students were told to pass their phone up and only allowed to use their phone during meal time. The reason being is that they don’t want the participants to take any stories that are deemed as inappropriate by the public. However, they are still told to play games that involved sexual activities. There were several complainants who felt uncomfortable during the games and resulted in them not being able to bond with their group mates. Just because they are seemed to be less fun.

As time passes by, I'm starting to develop feelings for him as well as he is really a fun and interesting guy, he's smart and he takes very good care of people in general and he has a good sense of humor too. Sometimes when I think about it, I think I'd make a greater pair together with him comparing to my best friend but I don't know if I should confess my feelings to him because I have known my best friend for a really long time and I don't want to lose my best friend. The thing is, even though my best friend has been clear that she really likes that guy (to us only), but she has never confessed to him or told him anything about it which means the guy is still available right? I'm pretty sure if i confess and end up together with the guy, my best friend will hate me for life but I really like him as well, what should I do?

If there is any groupwork component, avoid the part-time students like a plague. Honestly, I am so sick and tired of having to do group work with a bunch of irresponsible and unmotivated pieces of s***. It seems this is fairly common. They'll always use work commitments as an excuse for not doing stuff, late or even no show. If you can, take classes offered in the day time or with minimal groupwork, to avoid these idiots.

Back as undergrad, sure, groupwork wasn't always smooth sailing. But many part time students, seriously their mind is not committed to studies and class at all. I think this must be a good reason why NUS (and the local unis in general) have virtually all their undergraduate programmes strictly on a full time basis. I used to think there was no reason why undergrad courses cannot be part time, but i really think its the huge difference it makes in the student mindset. Many part time students dont seem to take things seriously which makes you wonder wtf they are doing in uni in the first place.

However, he is one year younger than me and I know the possibilities of us being together is very slim. Yet I hope things will turn for the better some day. Just back then during a cca meet up, a junior saw us engage in a conversation and would randomly cut in and teased him that someone (a common friend we have) is waiting for him/ drop in hints to him. He would shake his head and keep saying no. But when I caught a glimpse of him, his face was blushing. I didn't have the courage to confess or ask if he started a relationship with someone...

I’m always wondering what he’s really doing with all his free time instead of giving me just a little bit of it. Is there someone else or he simply doesn’t care about me anymore? 

Not counting the times we go out to have meals because human beings need to eat, it’s been months since we went out. Every weekend is the same routine: I go to his home and Netflix, have sex and actual chill. Sometimes no Netflix even, just sex and chill. Am I just a bootycall or what? 

The only love I feel from him is all the sweet words he says like ily, I can’t live without you, I wanna marry you.... you get the drift. I give him everything he wants and my duty as a gf, time, intimacy, reassurance and occasional gifts and help whenever he needs anything. I’ve even jeopardised some important things to me just to make him happy but I won’t dwell into that.

I’m so envious of my friends and co-workers who are in rs and the gfs are being treated so well. I told a few close friends of mine and they react to my story with a look of pity. I’m not demanding to be treated like a princess, I just want to be treated decently like a gf. There are guys in my workplace expressing their interest in me and treating me better than my bf, but I love my bf and and I don’t want to give up on our rs. 

I wish he can reflect on our rs and change. This is a basic bf duty and I don’t think I should tell him step by step how to be a decent bf. Haiz... NSF guys, please don’t be like this to your GFs... We are the ones on the losing end if you waste our 2 years waiting for you just to be treated like this...

If you read this far, any opinion/advice would be greatly appreciated.

Btw if you follow NUSWhispers posts, I’m Carol mentioned in a post before. 

TLDR; I feel my boyfriend is taking me for granted. I give him everything he wants, he doesn’t put in effort like I do, and he makes me feel like I’m just FWB to him rather than a GF.

Girls are always craving food, thinking of food, and finding new cafes to try. Girls always say they love to eat! But when they do eat, they say their appetite is small, and ask males to help finish because males supposedly have bigger appetites? 

But males, whose stomachs can finish so much food, don’t “love” food! They don’t care about what they eat, they are not enthusiastic about trying new food, and they don’t even go dessert shops to share cake! 

If men can eat so much, why don’t they say they love food? shouldn’t they be the ones always eating candy, chocolate, cake, and ice cream all the time?

Girls always say they love food and have cravings, yet they are the ones who say “but girl cannot eat much what”. 

I don’t get it. How do u have small appetite and love food at the same time? How do u have huge appetite and not love food?

Yes, as much as we complain about how the NUS Shuttle Bus isn't frequent enough to meet our needs and are often like a roller coaster, there are actually things that WE, the users of the shuttle bus, can make things better too!
1) To the people who are dying to get on the bus, please make way for people to get off. If you block the entire exit of the bus, are the people getting off supposed to step on you? Also, don't squeeze onto the bus as people are getting off, waiting for another minute won't kill you and will make the entire boarding process easier.
2) To the people who love to stand by the door when people are getting off, I hate to break it to you but you aren't as skinny as you think. No one fancy shoving through you to get off the bus. If you can step off the bus and reboard later, everyone will be able to have a pleasant experience. 
3) To the people who have already gotten onto the bus, if you see people trying to squeeze on the bus, please just take a step closer to your fellow commuters and more people can fit into the bus!
4) To the people who carry huge ass backpacks, putting your bag down on the bus will free up space for more to get on and also, you won’t be shoving your bags into your fellow commuters’ faces.

My bf and I are in our late 20s and just got together a few months ago. Since then, to be very honest, I’ve been having difficulties getting over his past relationships and sexual history. He’s more experienced in this aspect than me, having had 4 ex gfs and a number of one night stands previously, as compared to me having only 2 serious relationships before I met him (and never been on casual relationships / one night stands before). Sometimes the thought of him doing romantic and intimate stuff with his exes randomly cross my mind and make me feel uneasy. Even when we’re going about our daily lives, I’m sometimes bothered by such thoughts e.g.while having nice dinner out, I’ll wonder if he has taken his exes to the same place that we are eating. Same goes when we are trying new activities together or travelling. I even went to the extent of stalking his exes on social media and felt even worse after seeing that some of them are relatively good looking, and some still keep their couple photos with my bf.
I haven’t voiced out this issue to my bf as I’m scared it might cause unnecessary arguments that jeopardise our new relationship. Moreover, I also feel bad for opening up to him, as he has been really nice and loving to me so far, always around when I need him, always reassuring me that he loves me a lot and that he is very thankful to have found me. 
I know this is unhealthy and I really hate myself for feeling this way but I’m clueless as to what I can do to get over this jealousy / insecurity. Please help me, I’ll really appreciate it.

I have been following this page for a while now and realised there are quite a few posts about people saying they are unable to find love. They sound like not finding love makes them the beta human. I would like to say that I was and still am a beta person according to their criteria. But let me give you ""beta"" people an advice. You must have a goal and a burning passion for something in life. Let me tell you that once you have found this goal, you won't have time to worry about not getting a gf/bf cause you will have a bigger goal now. I excel in my passion and im one of the best in my country. People ask for my autograph when they see me in conventions. (It's a gaming hobby that i picked up 7 years ago). People might say ""oh you are the best cause you are smart"". I'm not even smart, my CGPA is only 2.4 and I am slow in learning. but what made me achieve my goals is my passion and the attitude to never give up rather than me being born smart. You have to put your goal above everything else except family. I hope the ""beta"" people here takes my advice and try to work on finding a goal and purpose. It really will change your life and the way you look at things. 

Yeah sex is cool and all but have you ever tried achieving your goals and have people you don't know want your autograph?

One day there was this online gathering, and I decided to attend since I have many online friends there and thought it would help me get through life a bit. From there, I met this girl. It wasn’t love at first sight, heck I was even trying to stop myself from falling in love with her since you know, suicide and also I was never in a relationship. But we bonded so well, she knew all of my secrets, even those i never told my 2 closest friends. She helped me through my depression. Gave me support, hang out with me. Said thingd like “I love you” but as a friend. holding hands, kisses on the cheek. Those 3 weeks was the most happy I have been in my entire life. She gave me a reason to live. She made me want to live. 

However, in later time I realised, she suck at love. Cause a few weeks after that initial “Happiest time of my life”, she started saying she have feelings for another man. Which I can’t do anything about since we were never officially together. All I can do is wish her a happy life. But we promised to stay as best friends. However, slowly be depression started to deteriorate again, which officially ended relationship with 3 of my best friends. Those 2mentioned prior and the girl i was in love with. So I shut myself off from life for a period of a month or so. Come back to found out she found another boyfriend. Then i realised, she suck at love she cant stay commited to a single person. Because of that, many of her victims suffered. 

Im not going to lie, I still have feelings for her since she made me felt love i never had before. But is she really worth it? Cause i bet if im there for her when she breaks up she will just play with me once again.

I understand the whole of SDE is undergoing renovations and the faculty basically does not exist. Okay, that's terrible planning for people who claim to study ""Design and Environment"" but I won't throw too much shade here because it might not have been their decision or fault entirely.

Before you ask, yes, this is about ThinkLab.

Before Archi took over or Com Ctr decided to allocate it to Archi, it was a free-to-use computer lab. There were people inside it at any given time of the day and some days it was hard to find a seat. And this isn't some small room we're talking about. There were at least a hundred over computers in there and they were regularly full up during exam period (okay where isn't) and even on a daily basis, the place was mostly occupied.

Now they've took over the lab because they closed theirs down for renovation. Alright. Fair enough, you need computers.

But you're going to plaster a sign that says ""ENTRY STRICTLY ONLY FOR DEPARTMENT OF ARCHITECTURE"", revoke everyone else's access to the lab, and have it empty full-time save for 3 lessons a week? Why?

Why not just have it open for the public for most of the day since nobody uses it anyway, and then put up a sign to get everyone out for the period of the lesson? It works for the engineering computer labs, I don't see why you have to be different and special.

And the fact remains that it's empty for most of the day. This is just being selfish.

Initially, I was told they would charge $35/h and they would collect 50% of commision for the first month. They claimed that the payment would be through the center to assure tutors remuneration. However, my tutee told me that the center charged her $40/h instead. This created some animosity between me and the tutee's parents. Furthermore at the end of the month, I was told by the center that I should collect the fees directly from the tutee instead. Upon confronting them, I was notified that apparently I was not under this ""QA Scheme"" that guaranteed tutors remuneration. Neither my tutee nor I was informed about this. Just like that, the responsibility of fee collection was passed from them to me. The worst of my nightmares had yet to end. Shortly after, my tutee decided to end the tuition, which left me with some uncollected fees. Throughout this whole ordeal, Learnseeker provided no support whatsoever deserving of that 50% commission. Till now, I have yet to collect my remaining fees. My point is, Learnseeker ought to provide greater transparency and give more concise instructions and not prey on undergraduate students by using vague and misleading terms in agreement.

However, one sore point remains unresolved up till today. See, my neighbours love to barbecue while my family shuns barbecue because we think it’s carcinogenic. My neighbours also installed multiple barbecue pits in their houses so that they can carry out their seasonal barbecue. However, with barbecue comes the fumes, and more pits equals more fumes. It is so bad then whenever they carry out their seasonal barbecues, my family has to shut our windows and the smell lingers in our house for days. We have tried to persuade both neighbours not to install so many pits or to barbecue under a fume hood, but advice (and even offers of money to part sponsor fume hoods) have gone unheeded.  

Now, neighbour 1 has installed industrial scale pits. This caused even neighbour 2 to complain about the barbecue fumes and inviting neighbour 1 to counter accuse neighbour 2 of starting the barbecue fumes first. Meanwhile, all 3 families are suffering from the fumes with nary a solution in sight. My neighbours, especially neighbour 1, has a religious love for barbecue so it’s unlikely they will give up barbecuing anytime soon. Anyone has any good advice on dealing with such neighbours?

Thing is, my parents disapprove of her because she's muslim. Even though i've assured them i wont be converting for the sake of marriage, they insist i break off seeing her one on one.
My gf totally respects my choice not to convert, and we've both mutually agreed on the possibility of us not working out. 
So we've sort of agreed to be friends, not in a R/s. Also she's not those ""religious"" kind of muslim, which just puts in the grey area because there's a chance of us working out, albeit small.

Is it that bad/wrong to be seeing someone of a different race/religion? It's just sad that people still think this way. I'm at a loss because i dont even know if it's ME at fault here, or just my parents' preconception about interfaith-racial relationships. I don't want to be burning bridges over something like this.

Also since we've agreed on remaining as friends, is going out with someone of the opposite gender from time to time REALLY that unbelievable? My parents are going ape shit whenever i inform them we're going to see a movie/have a meal. They think we're still dating and that my surname's gonna get changed.

No, lying isn't an option. I just wanna know how to get them to understand and see things from my perspective; that religion/race doesn't matter to ME even if it does to them. Am i being selfish? Am i in the wrong for even wanting to TRY to continue this R/S despite their disapproval?

I mentioned that I broke up with my ex last month who is currently in ns. The guys at the table all objected and said that it was unfair/I was unfaithful to him/unwilling to put in the effort to sustain the relationship. The other girls however were all on my side. Even after the convo moved on I sensed that the guys all treated me more coldly afterwards.

I dont think that I was in the wrong in any way. I was not unfaithful (in fact I'm still single now), and I messaged him literally every day, and tried to arrange to meet up every weekend. But he messaged me back very slowly, and did not want to meet up on weekends because he said he was tired. As a result, I felt that my emotional needs were not being met and didn't want to be attached to a boyfriend in name only. The guys all thought that being too busy to reply/too tired to meet were valid excuses. Even if they are, the fact is that I still got to meet him in person only once or twice a month. I understand that ns is not a choice, life is unfair, but that doesnt mean that I should have to suffer an increasingly distant relationship as well. I should have the chance to find someone who can fulfil my relationship needs.

But the guys all think that girls should have the obligation to stick with their bfs for the whole two years, no matter how much of a joke the relationship becomes.

COFN lets one half of the couple exit if a replacement can be found to form a family nucleus (eg parent, new lover etc) without the outgoing half losing the his/her half of the deposit. If you lost love, at least you don’t lose your money, and you can use that money to help you look for new love (dating ain’t cheap in Singapore yo). 

If you die die can’t find a replacement, just forfeit the deposit. You can earn the money back, but you can’t get back the time wasted in an unhappy marriage (at least for 3 years before the D).

They don't stop eating because they got a B, since they don't even get a B in the first place. I want to be that sort of person so bad, but I'm not.

And I think everyone can tell. I'm currently blinded by jealousy that my friend is getting research opportunities despite having a much lower CAP than me (neither of us have prior experience, although we are in different majors). So I think the profs can clearly tell that even though I have much better grades, it's all phoney, so the opportunities go to other people.

597,"When you asked me... Will I leave you if you cheated... I said no.

Not because I didn't felt it before.
I saw the text you sent to another man, with all the sexual contents.
I saw the pictures, all with you naked and some... With that man's dick in you.
I saw the videos, of the guy pumping you and your moans echoed the room.
You said you were at work, but the gallery on your phone says otherwise. The text that you sent him says otherwise.
You said you don't like sending nudes, but all the nude pics you sent him are selfies.
You said you didn't like to give blowjobs, but half the videos I saw were you giving it to him.
You said you don't like anal, but the man's semen has been inside there before.

At least half of the sexual activity you had was with that man... And by fate I just had to know all of that.

So when you asked me if I would leave you if you cheated... I'll say no.
Not because I never felt it before... But because I did and I didn't leave you. 

But oh well... Since you're already doing it... I don't think you'll mind if I do it as well right?

599,"Sorry in adv for the long post but I needed to get this off my chest and I’m scared my friends will judge me if I tell them.

Ive been with my ex-boyf, let’s call him G, since the start of Y1. We study diff subjects but I always made time to spend with him no matter how busy I got during lunch or wtv (I’m from a fac where the schedule is very hectic). In return he would always buy me food and pay for stuff. We applied for overseas exchange tgt and we got our same first choice of uni (in europe), and we made alot of plans to go travelling and stuff.

Truth is that as soon as I got accepted I started thinking of reasons to dump him. I just really wanted a angmoh boyf. I know it sounds bad but it’s like, G already got to have me to himself for 2 years and I was very loyal to him the whole time. I never even looked at any other guy and never went out with guys alone. I only get the chance to go on exchange once in my life and I didnt want to be burdened with something I chose in Y1, especially since it was so long ago.

So 1 week before we flew over (we bought tickets tgt) I changed my flight to an earlier one and broke up with G. I tried to be nice and I even had sex with him one last time before I left his place. Afterward he kept trying to text me and beg me to patch back but I didnt reply him.

Fast forward a week and I was settling in at the uni (not going to say which one incase people guess who I am) and I met this really hot angmoh, let’s call him B. B had short blonde hair and blue eyes like the waters of Bali. He was also taller than G (at least 180cm – I’m only 167 and G was 172) and had a very muscular chest and shoulders. When I first saw him I was like omgggggggg I literally died and came back to life and died again!!

He started talking to me on the first day of lectures and we instantly hit it off. He was so funny, and he understood me so well. It was perfect. When he asked me to hang out outside of class I immediately jumped at the chance! One day we went back to my room and started making out. I felt this attraction Ive never felt with G or any other SG guy before. After a few days we had sex for the first time. I was so shocked because I had never gone to homerun with anyone so fast before but we had this amazing connection, but it felt so right. I have always been a feminist and I wanted to be more sex-positive. I came from a very traditional background and my parents always wanted me to save myself. In the end I wanted to prove that this is my body, so I did a lot of ‘dirty’ things with B that I never even thought about doing with G.

As time went on I started seeing B less and less, and when we met it was always me going over to his house for sex. Sometimes he didnt use protection and just pulled out. I started getting angry with him and demanded to know where he was but he would start ignoring me. I didnt want to admit to myself that he was just using me, so I tried using the same tactics I used on G when we were together.

Soon B started avoiding me and in my sadness I messaged G again, thinking he would be desperate to get back tgt with me (he used to talk about BTO and kids so often it really freaked me out). When he didnt reply my repeated messages I stalked his insta and found out he got a angmoh girlf! They post all these gross couple workout videos and seeing him with her made me feel sick. I dont even know why she would be with him. He’s slightly shorter than her and his dick isn’t that big (I should know). And its not my fault that I wanted to try something new. G was so boring and he cant compete with B’s looks. I didnt even think angmohs would be interested in SG guys (she’s really very pretty).

Should I confront her for stealing him, even though I know that I broke up with him first? I’m really very conflicted and I feel so stupid and used. When I first saw their photos I let my anger get the better of me and I messaged G’s parents telling them that he dumped me for some angmoh slut. He didnt tell them about us so they got very angry and scolded him (they’re also very traditional). He messaged me yst and said that not just was he never going to talk to me again, but he never wanted to date a singaporean girl ever again because ‘european girls are so much better in every way’. I now know I was wrong, but I dont know what to do to fix it and I still want G back.

Thanks for reading my blog post. If you have any advice please comment I will be reading them...

602,"Me and my (ex-?)boyfriend we have been together for 3 years. We loved each other a lot, and even have plans for our future, getting BTO etc. However, things turned for the worst ever since we hit the 1 year mark, where we started to see compaitability issues, different outlook in life. But we tried our best to resolve them, or rather we would just leave it to be. He would often MIA when we start talking about this problem, coming out with excuses to avoid these serious talks. And leave me hanging or upset for the rest of the night.

He went for his exchange earlier this year and mine started on the later half of the year. We had no chance to meet at all as it overlaps, and hence it increased the frequency of our arguments. It surrounded mainly on how I am not prioritising him when he is the one who had no time for me (we only facetime once a month or not at all). He started thinking about a future that is according to his goals, his interest, and not me. What is the most important is, he never provided me the emotional support and I find myself going to someone else instead when in difficult situations. We have very different values. He often say he love me, but never actually act like he do.

So I decided that we had to take a break, that perhaps we will both reflect and be more accepting of our differences, since after all we really do love each other a lot. I brought that up and since then, it was the last time we talked, there was no closure, nothing.

But rather than trying to find a way to solve this, he immediately started using all the dating apps, hooking up with girls and going out on dates searching for a new partner. This isn't considered cheating but to be honest, it didn't feel really good. I took the time to heal and hoping we can get back together or find a way out of this, but all he did was give up on the relationship.

When you tell them to lower their volume, they would casually laugh it off and continue their game. In the end, those who wish to study are indirectly forced to vacate these tutorial classrooms. It is especially infuriating when they neither book the classroom nor were they the initial occupants in these classrooms. This has been going on for the past few weeks and they are getting noisier. I hope that the CCA can be better managed if they provide them with proper venues for them instead of letting them disturb the people who actually want to study.

609,"Been in a relationship for 1 year plus. I know its rather short for people out there, but small conflicts have started to surface. My girlfriend is a very independent lady. Since both of us are in uni now, though different schools, I always try to make and effort to study with her. She loves studying at the National Library in bugis as she mentioned that the table there is huge, lights are bright, many seats and its located near her house. However, i live near Pasir Ris park and travelling to bugis is rather inconvenient. I tried to compromise with her, probably going to a library where it will be more accessible for both parties, but she is too stubborn to give in. She even mentioned that she is alright to study by herself, as both of us are doing vastly different courses and we cannot possibly talk in the library. 

Anyways, moving on, we have been dating for more than a year, but she hasn't met any of my friends. Not even my best friends. They've only heard of her from me and saw her pictures on my instagram but none of them ever saw her irl. They thought i hallucinated on having a girlfriend lol. She just doesn't seem to be interested in socialising with my circle of friends. I mean she was like this all the while, even before we dated and I'm quite licky i got to be her boyfriend considering the number of people she interact with on a daily basis. Although she also doesn't interfere with my social life, which may cause other guys to be jealous, since i have a couple of close fenale friends too, she doesn't seem to be too bothered. She doesn't check my phone or get suspicious whenever i goes to the club etc. Not that i have cheated on her but it just seems like she doesn't give a shit about me. My guy friends would occasionally bring their girlfriends out for dinner but me, eventhough attatched, is always alone, being the 3rd wheeler.

Sometimes i wonder if I'm too clingy. Or is it because I'm too ugly (which i honestly don't think so), hence she feels too secure whenever I'm out alone as no girls would prey on me.

612,"This story is based off my cousin's relationship. She is 25 now and her husband is the same age as her. They have been married for about 1 and a half years now and have a baby of 7 months old too. 
Before they got married,her husband (then bf) cheated on her twice in the span of 4 years. Both times he was caught by her and he had promised to change.
Come the day that he proposed, which was also the day that my cousin thought ""ok he is serious with this relationship and he will definitely change"" 
Sadly that was not the case. Fast forward 6 months into the marriage things started to turn sour. As they are awaiting for their rental flat to get approved they have both been staying at my cousin's family home. Fights about privacy,money,time together,starting a family started to arise. Keep in mind that these are also being made known to my auntie and basically the whole family as their fights take place in her house since they live there. No signs of improvement on his end but she still believed its just stresses of newly-weds and it will fade away one day. Turns out,he had also turned to alcohol to ""drown his stresses"" which made my cousin more heartbroken,nights where she can't sleep awaiting her husband to come home,needing to ensure he is home safe and hopes he doesn't cause a scene at home when he is drunk.
Fast forward and they had a baby,she thought after giving birth to their child,things will stabilise (they have their own flat now)
But recently she found out that he had another girl behind her back for a few months (this was while she was pregnant) and he basically told his ""girlfriend"" or bootycall that he is single and his wife is just his best friend.
My cousin is of devastated but he promises that the fling only went on for 2 months and he felt guilty and has since ended things with the girl.
We have all advised her to step away from this man but she is lost and doesn't want her baby to grow up without a father or have a broken family. Please #help we are lost too

Unlike my peers, instead of settling for a typical IT career, I devoted myself full time into an MLM that I had been involved in since my university days. The MLM, of Middle Eastern origins, is in the business of providing motivational and life coaching to participants. Participants were highly encouraged to give back to the MLM for the benefit of themselves and others. With my fellow directors' efforts, we grew the MLM to be one of the largest in Singapore and the region. The revenue grew to a level that my family and I could afford to move into Sentosa Cove.

However, even though all seems smooth sailing, there are problems unknown to others. Chief of which is my wife, or rather her dream. She loves singing and always harboured the dream to have an album of her own. Our MLM is also exploring using music to spread our motivational and life coaching messages to even more people. Getting her to front this project would be a nice fit. Yet, I feel uncomfortable that in a way, the MLM is sponsoring my wife's personal dream. I am also disturbed when preliminary talks with some music producers involved musical concepts on Chinese alcohol which may not be a good fit for our wholesome motivational and life coaching corporate messaging.

What should I do? Should I choose to fulfil my wife's dream with the MLM's financial backing or to let a neutral third party decide for the greater good of the MLM?

I read an article a while back in ST of a girl who was obese, lost a ton of weight by binging and purging and eating almost nothing when she restricts, overexercising, obsessing every waking moment- and guess what the local nutritionists said? That she was still bmi 16+, so that's not too bad, some young people are naturally that bmi and that's ok, they'll get heavier as they age, and oh does she know she isn't being healthy, she shouldn't just count calories, she should be counting sugar intake, saturated fat intake, focusing on whole grains, whole foods, yada yada. Telling her to become more obsessed, not less.

I'm so angry. I'm angry that I'm not thin enough to get help. I'm angry that the help here sounds like it is stuck in 3 decades ago. I'm angry that the authorities keep telling people to fixate on this and that and this, I fixate on just one thing (calorie count) and I'm in this mess. I'm angry that there are so many NUS students walking around looking thinner than me, because it means I'm a failure.

630,"I've been seeing all these posts about love life or crushes and wanting to be in a relationships. 

So here's my two cents on this.

If you ever ever want to be in a Relationship because you either wanna feel ""complete"" or ""have someone by yourside"" or feel loved everyday, my advice to you is, don't. 

Relationships were never meant to fill gaps in your heart and erase your solidarity in life. It's up to you to do this on your own for god's sake, don't expect someone to love you when you yourself, don't even love who you are. 

Love yourself first. Then improve on your own qualities not for that ""special someone"", but for yourself first. There's always this chinese saying ""愛人入己"" (Love others like how you love yourself) for a reason.

If you ever want to be in a relationship because ""Waaaah drama so sweet worr the guy and girl so cute together keep doing cute thingies together siaa, I wish I can be like them!!!!!"", don't.

Life isn't like your Taiwan or Korean or Chinese or ""The fault in our stars"" or ""Twilight"". They paint you rosy pictures of how relationships are. Don't you ever wonder why are the guy and girl leads always so free? They can do all these cutsy stuff together so often, gazing deeply into each of their eyes, smudging icecream on their noses, promising to love each other forever?

That's because dramas...they don't really show how busy a person's life can be and yeah, they don't show the responsibilities. (I'm referring to work or studying religiously for the exams)

No one have all the time in the world to be with one another 24/7 and do cute surprises every now and then, excluding the once in a bluemoon surprises for celebrations or popping by for surprises.

When you and your partner are busy working/studying, there's not much time for all these cutsy stuff or lovey-dovey outings almost everyday or multiple times a week. There isn't. 

Sure there can be surprises but don't ever expect love lifes to be as fulfilling as K-Dramas when you two reach adulthood.

Bottom line is, Love yourself first before loving someone or else you're going to depend on your partner for your own happiness, which shouldn't be the case. You're suppose enrich your partner's life, and they will too, not leeching onto each other's life to fill in a gap inside you.
And ohh. Keep love life realistically. Everyone have their own life going on, and your partner isn't orbiting around you 24/7.

632,"Just want to get this off my chest. This is not a troll post. 

A few years ago, I met this girl from an anime event and we added each other as friends on Fb. 1 weeks later she messaged me and we chatted for a while. she told me she was 30 and engaged. I was surprised as she seemed young (I was only 21). She asked me out but I rejected. She was really sad and regretted telling me about herself. She then sent me dozens of messages trying to convince me. 

I felt bad and decided to meet her thinking there’s no harm. we met at the MRT at night and She brought me to the karaoke and ordered a lot of alcohol to my surprise. We both got high and kissed. Then we went back home. I thought to myself that nope I’m never meeting her ever again. 

1 week later she messaged me saying she wanted to meet but I had exams so I said no. she said she wanted to come to my house. I said no but somehow she managed to convince me again. So she came to my house. I studied while she did her own stuff. But she started to touch and seduce me and we ended up having sex. she knew the way to my house already and would come every weekend and we did it every time. I was ok with it since it’s like free one just take lor. 

Until a point I thought this can’t continue anymore so I blocked her and chased her off when she came over. However my parents already knew about her and scolded me for chasing her off. I told my parents everything about her but they sided with her. eventually she went to seduce my Father, making my mom angry and wanting to chase her off. I wanted to call the police for harassment but my Father wouldn’t allow it. Things became ugly but eventually everything was settled when I told her not to harass our family anymore or I would call the police. 

I felt like I was sexually harassed and my privacy was violated but most people wouldn’t think so because most think that only happens to girls right? It still leaves a scar on me and I regretted ever meeting such a person.

I totally didn't expect the amount of hate I got from my confession. Maybe because I haven't added more details. But here goes. When I started talking to him, I made it a point to ignore every message any guy sends me. Even my male friends that I know irl. Of course, this is with the exception of schoolwork related topics. If I put in this amount of effort to stay committed, don't I have the right to expect the same from him? Anyway I'm glad that I tested him, since I doubt he'll be loyal anyway.

Recently my bf told me that his ex asked him out for coffee, and at the same time help out with some projects she is working on. I think it is nice of him to ask for my permission before meeting the ex, and he repeatedly assured me that he has no feelings for her anymore (the ex is also currently attached), but in the end I still told him I feel uncomfortable with him meeting her. Well, who knows what that meet up session will lead to? Also, I myself do not believe in keeping in contact or staying friends with my exes and I expect my partner to do the same. I think reconnecting with people from our past dating lives is pointless and not going to do us any good, especially when we are already happily settled in a new relationship. However, I somehow feel ok when he meets up with his female friends and colleagues, just not his exes. Am I being overly possessive or unreasonable here?

642,"I (M) started using CMB recently, and have been getting a healthy number of matches. For context, I’m average looking with an average build, have a decent professional job, and am looking for something serious. 

However, I’ve had a daunting and tiring experience. 

Most of my matches “liked” my profile but either kept completely quiet, or took ages to reply (e.g. 1 day). Several matches, though highly educated (e.g. some graduated with a FCH), do not bother responding to my questions, and respond with replies that display zero sincerity. Now while I do appreciate that we all have a life outside of dating apps, I still take the effort to reply my matches as often as I can - my work typically ends around 8-11pm or later, and I do not use CMB while at work.

Recently, I was offered a free CMB premium trial, and am now able to view the stats of all of my matches. This has led me to some interesting observations:

(1) Many girls reply to only around 20-30% of their chats.

(2) The better-looking matches tend to be more reluctant to start chats, and also tend to reply less to chats.

(3) Numerous girls tend to reply after at least 10-12 hours. These girls are also typically those who reply to fewer chats.

To all the LADIES out there, out of curiosity, why do girls return “likes” but keep completely silent / display a complete lack of interest thereafter? I find this very baffling because if you aren’t interested at all, then why “like” my profile in the first place?

For avoidance of doubt, I did not notice any fake profiles.

643,"Referring to post 68787, I am also an NUS pharmacy graduate.
I find it rather sad at how all the passionate clinical pharmacists commenters are all busy monologuing about how clinical practice is a calling and that anyone who disagree is either ungrateful, unenlightened or both. In other words, they kindly request that all unhappy souls change to a different field of practice. While that is an extremely good piece of advice to heed, it is highly likely that clinical pharmacists will remain underpaid/overworked/not well respected because of these people. Instead of addressing valid points raised by people who have opposing views on the profession (such as those by the commenter, Han Qi En on the same post 68787) , they prefer to live in an echo chamber and adopt a holier than thou attitude. 

To those unhappy clinical pharmacists: Move! You are not a tree. The grass is not always greener on the other side but it is still better than not trying.

But I don’t, instead I take the MRT / wear clothes I purchase from Taobao / dabao from hawker centres just like most of them. So I honestly don’t know where that specific label came from and it’s bothering me. Probably because I’m always the one paying bills during the outings first? Or is it because I don’t take bank loans for university fees (but they don’t too)? Or is it because I seem so carefree whenever I spend money even without part-time jobs? This may seem like a humble brag to some (idk if it is but just stating in case), but I'm really not. You will only understand how I feel when you are in my shoes (like not rich but people always say you rich).

I didn’t feel safe enough to tell anyone around me about it, even though I knew many friends who were clearly feeling unusually unhappy or stressed out too. When I was 19, a friend of mine took his life after suffering from severe psychosis. I remember that I had to find out through facebook, where his wall was filled with remembrance posts and his status had become ‘in memoriam’. Such a stark change, and with such finality.

We have all come in touch with one person or another who has grappled with mental illness. Yet, why is this something which we are unable to talk about with acceptance and openness? Why can't we break this suffocating stigma?

650,"Hey everyone! I'm a year 2 NUS student needing to let something off my chest. I know this may not be a very big issue but i feel as if i'm at a crossroad of my university life. 

I currently have a small group of friends (who we have known one another other for a year) who i hang out with in school. They are generally okay but they kinda love to make fun of me (sometimes with low key insults) whenever we go for canteen breaks in between lectures. I don't really like it but I'm not sure if i'm too sensitive as well. Sometimes the people around me throw casual insults which leaves me feeling kinda bad after so i'm not entirely sure if its something i have to change in the first place. Ultimately, this group of friends are people that i interact with because of school work and I can say with an upmost assurance that they would highly likely be out of my life after graduation. 

I'm not sure if I will be viewed as the crook here but I feel like i can do better by finding myself 'better' friends, or possibly some other friends who i can 'click' better with. I know its a little too soon but i have recently joined a cca in hopes of a more supportive circle of friends. 

I hope that this doesn't make me sound like a depressed person because i feel fine, just a little sad that i have not found my group of friends who i feel really close to yet. I also hope that this wouldn't come across as a pity post.Instead I would be really grateful to listen to any advice to make my university life a more memorable one. Thanks! :)

660,"I graduated from NUS a year ago. Here’s my story. Tldr. 

My aunt, who is a motherly figure to me passed on in my first year of studies (Sem 2). It was a sudden death from stroke. Till today, it affects me so badly. I miss her so much and I cry say 3-4 times a week just thinking about it. 

In year 1, I also had a budding relationship with a guy. It certainly was an exciting phase of my life. I even told my aunt about the guy but had not introduced them to each other. Here’s the thing, the passing of my aunt was just too painful for me to bear. I didn't actually share my pain with the guy. 

Just mostly kept it in and carried on with life. I grieved super badly for about 3 months and cried every morning/ at night before bed.Then it was orientation camp period. I was super active during the summer so that kind of suppressed the grief a little. 

I grieved every now and then. But I wouldn't say it affected my daily life. Had and on-off relationship with the same guy throughout uni. It was exciting, it was fun. But I never truly opened up to him. I felt like I was portraying this image of myself to him. Sometimes I ranted to him about daily stuff and I think he got annoyed. Ultimately we broke up for good because our values didn't align me. I felt like I invested so much in the relationship (albeit not opening up). I gave in to him. I based my decisions around him. So it really hurt when at times he couldn't give in to me, couldn't understand my perspective, didn't invest in it as much as I did. I didn't have much friends throughout my time at NUS so I kinda felt that my 4 years here all went to naught. 

Like I just wasted my life on this guy, hung out so much with this guy-when I could have spent my remaining time back in year 1 with my aunt. I wished I didn't go for orientation camps and didn't meet the guy. 

Anyway, I kinda found closure with the guy. I mean I guess I learnt a lot through the relationship and even though things didn't work out, I'm glad I learnt from it.

So anyway after the breakup, for about the past year or so. I've been grieving Super badly over my aunt. It kinda feels like a delayed grieve reaction. I have so many regrets. And now that I'm earning quite a bit of money; but I can't pamper her anymore. 

Im not sure if it's because I'm no longer invested/ infatuated with someone that's why I can grieve properly or that I'm no longer busy chasing my CAP etc so I have time to think. Don't get me wrong, I was grieving throughout my undergrad years but it felt like I suppressed part of the emotions. 

Anyway I still miss my aunt so much and I rly don't know how I can go through the next few decades in my life without her.

Ya, so i rambled quite a bit. And no I’m not suicidal. There are ppl in this world whom I love. It’s just idk how I’d go on and that every sweet moment in life is pretty bittersweet to me. Just wondering if delayed grief reaction is normal. Actually I wouldn’t say it’s delayed la. Idk if it’s complicated grief cos there’s so many things I wish I did for my aunt and didn’t do. And I still miss her a lot. It hurts me like crazy.

After the event, she invited me for the afterparty (free entry), cause she say doesn't like clubbing with people that she's not close with, but I was out studying and not dressed to club. And if I wasn’t going, she was going to go home.

I know many of you trollers will comment all the anime terms under this confession, which i don't mind. But please, can you guys tell me the meaning too? It's really getting on my nervers ugh!!

674,"Referring to #68787. To set the stage clear, I am a pharmacist working in a hospital. I respect doctors and I believe good inter-professional relationships between pharmacists and doctors (or any other other healthcare professional for that matter) is important. I say that because I believe we should not think of the issue of pharmacists having sole dispensing rights as pharmacists fighting over doctors for these rights, or doctors 'oppressing' pharmacists. 

The issue about pharmacists having sole dispensing rights is one about medication safety and optimising patient care. Granting pharmacists sole dispensing rights ensures that all prescriptions are checked so that medication errors can be rectified and patients can get the best care. Pharmacists can also value-add by providing other services like identifying medication-related issues during dispensing, and giving more in-depth and tailored counselling than an untrained clinic assistant. 

I have personally seen many questionable prescriptions from GPs, such as inappropriate use/choice/duration/dose of antibiotics, contributing to antibiotic resistance, as well as other medication errors. I am sure many pharmacists can attest to that. These errors happen because there is no one to counter-check if the medications prescribed are appropriate and safe. Such errors are greatly minimised in places like hospitals because there are pharmacists to ensure the appropriateness of each medication prescribed. 

To clarify, I am not downplaying the competency/importance of doctors. They are the most important people in a patient's care (along with nurses) but we need to realise that doctors are also humans. They do not know everything and mistakes can occur. And perhaps as one of the commentors wrote, we should look into the actual frequency of medication errors, as well as the value that pharmacists, as experts in medication use, can provide in preventing them. 

I agree that patients having to go somewhere else to collect their medications will be a hassle and may cause compliance issues. Increased costs for patients is also an issue. However, I these should not be reasons as to why a patient's care should be compromised. These are issues that can possibly be worked around with creative solutions. Perhaps there could be a centralised 24/7 centre where GPs have to send prescriptions to, for the prescriptions to be checked by a pharmacist, before someone at the clinic can physically dispense the medication to the patient? Of course, this is just an idea, possibly flawed, and I acknowledge I may not have a perfect solution. But the point is, as PM Lee once said, ""we need to come up with creative ideas and solutions"". Regarding the point on increased costs for patients, we should also not forget that there will be savings in other costs such as decreased utilisation of healthcare resources resulting from inappropriate medication use. For example, inappropriate antibiotic use contributes to multi-drug resistant bacterial infections which will incur huge costs. Perhaps some form of subsidy from the government can take away the burden of extra costs for patients. 

TLDR: Pharmaciats should be given sole dispensing rights on the basis that they are the experts in medication use and should play a bigger role in ensuring safety and optimal medication use in a patient's treatment, whether or not in the hospital or community setting.

You guys already had your own offices before that. If the school is   going to convert our study area into your own office area, please at least give us an equivalently good studying area and not hog the area with the best view to yourselves. 

Now, students like us have 1 less studying place and it was also by far the best studying spot given the aircon and amazing view (especially at night). The rest of the studying places are either hot, funky smelling, have limited seats or old/rundown.

I’m not trying to be a grammar nazi and neither do I think I am better than anyone but I do have a reason for posting that (:
My current boss is also a university graduate and from time to time, she is required to send out announcement emails to the whole office. Majority of her emails have errors (such as advice vs advise) and to be honest, I feel a little embarrassed for her as I have heard colleagues from other departments making snide remarks about her emails behind her back. Before you jump the gun and berate me for just posting it here and not doing anything about it, I would like to say that I have attempted correcting her gently (as she is my superior) but she has hinted to me that she doesn’t appreciate the feedback hence I have ceased doing that.
I saw someone commenting on my original post about ‘Lend vs Borrow’ and I thought that was another great example which people always seem unclear about.

It's funny how people are showing contempt for technological innovations and choosing to embrace a primitive mindset by refusing to move forward with times. 

Yes, I'm aware that there have been some injuries as a result of pedestrians jaywalking across walkways without even bothering to check their surroundings. But isn't it a small price worth paying for the conveniences of a car-lite future? Think about how quickly you get your food when you order through delivery services. Or how you or your kids can now travel the distances previously attainable only by a car, without the hassle of obtaining a driver’s license which can be quite expensive. Too bad for all you haters, but I'm glad the authorities have the foresight not to completely ban the devices, knowing full well of the economic and social implications. Neither have they bowed down to populist demands to have omnipresent enforcement at void decks, which would be an unnecessary strain on resources.

Is it normal to be jealous of you brother's gf? I'm 21; he's 26 and the gf is 25 this year. He had 2 exes but he wasn't in a serious rs the previous times so I this odd feeling did not exist. However, my brother seems to be super serious with this current gf and whenever we have htht, she will be brought into the convo. He always share his dream of putting the wedding ring on her finger and how he want 3 kids after marriage etc. Jealousy always kicks in whenever this happens. It feels as though I would be stripped off from all the love and attention he'd showered upon me for the past 21 years, once he gets married.

He is an awesome brother, best friend and advisor, basically my emotional pillar of 21 years. And the thought of us living under different roofs one day bugs me all the time. It got even stronger when he is starting to plan the proposal recently.

I know this is absolutely wrong, and I know how I contradict myself when I claim I want him to have a blissful marriage but on the other hand, avoiding all interactions with his current gf. I honestly feel awfully bad about having these feelings lingering and being so possessive over my brother. But i cannot possibly tell him this to worry him, right? I guess his gf can sense it too and I'm afraid it will affect their rs. Times when she wanted to pass my a gift or strike a convo, I made up an excuse and locked myself in the bedroom till she left or simply left the house to take a breather.

If I wanted to do sales, I'd rather sell something which I know what I am talking about, and at least it is an actual product that has utility to the buyer. Best case is when a buyer already knows what they want, all that is required is to tell them where it is placed. Not harass acquaintences on  ̶s̶o̶s̶h̶e̶r̶ social media and cold calling in a bid to grow  ̶d̶o̶w̶n̶l̶i̶n̶e̶s̶ legs while doing the same for an upline.

Yes, retail can be one long chain from the manufacturer to the importer/distributor to the reseller to the consumer, with each stage adding more to the cost the consumer pays. Of course there are things like import taxes and customs along with the guarantee of warranty, so maybe some real value is being added along the line in terms of product support and bringing the item to somewhere the consumer can obtain it. Case in point, there was a posting that almost thought Prof Ben ran a logistics company. That is actually the local distributor of some electronics you might be using, but you might not be able to get direct from them. Money comes in from outside the manufacturer, product(without artificial demand from inside the company) transfers to the consumer on the outside. There might be some backdoor deals going on in terms of that logistics chain, but be it Challenger or a shop in Sim Lim Square, the general idea is there.There are also online channels now, so no hard selling from store staff.

TLDR: Avoid MLMs like the plague, if want to do sales, work for reputable stores and/or brands.

I never had one night stands/friends with benefits/casual sex/committed relationships before. How does having sex even......happen? Does the guy initiate and propose, then the girl accepts? Or does that just naturally happen without anyone asking out loud? Why hadn’t anyone verbally asked me? Why has every other girl I know been “asked”? Did someone ask them, or do they just spontaneously take their clothes off? 

Also, I never gone on massive shopping spree before. I always see people around me buy around 2-3 clothes every month, and their money just naturally flows out. They buy dresses, skirts, and makeup every month (some even every week) without batting an eyelid! They seem to have a lot of money ( to me at least) but whenever I ask them, they casually answer “Zara and Topshop are not very expensive what! Forever 21, H&M, the Editors market are cheap!” 

But I see that they spend $200 (around that amount) on clothes and makeup every other week/month, and i can’t bring myself to spend so much so naturally. What if I got no savings then how? Is it that easy to .....fritter away 100-200 on clothes all the time? 

I am not sure if I have ever felt “touched” or “moved” by song lyrics. When people sing about sharing a bed every night with someone they love, when people sing about how the bed is emptying because they lost someone they love, i stare at the lyrics blankly because I never got hugged to sleep. I never had a Boyfriend/fwb/ons. 

I never cried over song lyrics because I cannot relate. I don’t even know how to make my money naturally flow out, how do i make emotions naturally flow?

689,"So I have had a lot girls, for whom I’ve had feelings for but they haven’t really liked me back or have just friendzoned me. The way I have dealt with these feeling so far is that everytime, someone has broken up with me, rejected me or I have felt that they don’t like me, I have suppressed those feelings, instead of actually trying to resolve them. The way I have gone about this is to replace the feelings and fantasies about that person, with fantasies about another person (whom I haven’t actually had feelings for). The fantasies are mostly non-sexual. Just mostly about what my life would be like if I were together with that person. Mostly just romantic. It has mostly been successful so far.  

So the situation right now is this. I had feelings for a girl, lets call her Person A. I liked her for a long time and I eventually confessed to her and she rejected me. So then I proceeded to suppress those feelings by replacing her with another person (Person B) in my fantasies. Person B is someone I know. The problem is that  as a side effect of this strategy, I ended up falling for Person B. I realise that Person B isn’t interested in me so I tried to suppress my feelings for her by fantasising about Person C but now I feel I am digging my hole deeper. Person C is a platonic friend whom I was never interested in, romantically. Now I realise that in the process of trying to suppress my feelings for person B, I have started developing feelings for Person C. (It’s a mess I know). So I halted the process in the middle.  

I don’t want to confess to either person B or C because they are both my friends and I dont want to sabotage my friendship, even though getting rejected might help me move on. So now, even though I eventually got over person A  I have unresolved feelings for B and C.  And this is seriously messing with my head and it is confusing me no end. I don’t think either of them actually like me, romantically and they are both out of my league. So what do I do? How do I recover my sanity again? How do I stop myself from feeling this way?

704,"I am the OP of #68663, responding to the comments suggesting that the CMB profiles I was referring to are fake. One Xu S Han, for instance, claimed that “CMB uses fake profiles to con carrots like you”. 

While I think there is some force in the claim that the profiles I had referred to in my earlier post are fake, I thought I should just highlight a couple of indicators that point strongly against that.

First, my friends and I had, in the past, matched with some of these bagels. These bagels in fact responded to our messages, at least in the first two days. They also typed in a colloquial, local manner. However, it usually became quickly obvious from their responses that they were not interested. 

Second, these bagels have, over time, updated their profiles, whether it be job title, descriptions, new photos and even the order of their photos. I am generally quite observant, and can remember these little details very easily.

Third, as some of these bagels are actually friends of my friends, I have incidentally chanced upon a few of their Facebook profiles (from group pictures and Facebook posts). Interestingly, the photos used in their CMB profiles are completely different from those they had uploaded on Facebook. Obviously, CMB could not have magically created these photos out of nowhere. They were not photoshopped. 

Fourth, and as absurd as this sounds, I think this is one of those situations where it is apt to use the phrase “you know it when you see it”. Feel free to disagree, but I think those of us who have used CMB will get my drift. 

Needless to say, I’m not suggesting that these permanent residents of CMB are doing anything wrong. Rather, the behaviour of these bagels is merely a reflection of a social phenomenon that has arisen with the advent of online dating (read my earlier post). 

On a final note, apart from the points raised in my earlier post, I think it is safe to say that for most of us using CMB, it becomes increasingly easy over time to sieve the chaff from the wheat.

707,"I (M) started using CMB again recently, two years after I deleted my account. 

Out of curiosity, I scrolled through the profiles of the female bagels in the Discover section, with the option “Active within the last 72 hours” selected. 

Interestingly, I spotted many familiar-looking bagels who I had “liked” previously, two to three years ago. Most of them are at least a 7/10.

Initially, I thought that these girls might perhaps, like me, have returned to CMB (for various reasons) after staying away from it for a while. However, this notion quickly proved to be wrong when I started seeing more and more familiar faces.

To be sure, I showed some of the profiles to a few friends of mine who are active CMB users (more so than I am). My friends unanimously agreed that they had seen these same profiles for an extended period of time.

I cannot help but wonder why so many pleasant-looking girls have continued using CMB for such a long time. 

Is CMB really bereft of decent chaps, so much so that this has left them to become permanent CMB residents? Or are people just overly caught up in the illusion of “choice”, to the extent that they end up spending so much time men searching for the elusive “one”.

In any event, as someone who’s using CMB to find something serious, I know what to do when these familiar-looking profiles appear as suggested matches.

My dad is not well educated. We are financially poor. The main reason I stopped attending my relatives function is that every time, my mum get mocked indirectly for her condition and my dad is being mocked for being poor(in the sense, he accepts money) from his family from time to time. Which children like having to go through this when their own parents doesn't get any respect. As a matter of fact, I stopped attending all the events. The problem is - I can't avoid them completely. My problem is I can't find closure. All the past events is messing up my mind and I can't forget or make peace with my ownself.

713,"I'm a Y3 student in a uni clique of 4 males and 3 females. We knew each other during orientation and 2 of them even became a couple. I'm pretty close to the other 2 girls and we meet up pretty often without the other 4 guys and we really enjoy the times spent. Both of them are really genuine friends. However, when we are out or just texting with the other 4 guys, things changed. I really envy them. One of them got to have a bf just 3 months into uni, but ok because i admit, she is really pretty. But the other, she is only decent looking so i don't get why all the other guys' attention are always on her. Her 21st birthday is coming soon and we have a separate tele group for her surprise, where everyone seems so enthu, including the 3 single guys. When it was my 21st last year, i clearly remembered one not attending the party they held for me. 

Furthermore, guys are always calling her cute. Okay again, I'll admit, she is definitely cute even for people of the same sex, but why does she get all the attention? Like all of them laugh at her jokes all the time, and when it's my turn, they sort of fake laugh to make things less awkward. I feel really neglected. Probably cos she always join them in video games like pubg or so, which i don't enjoy, hence the common topic. Not only that, she is really wealthy. Like wth what has she done in her previous life to have this luck. I mean she is a really nice girl, sending me to and fro school and home foc whenever she is available, and I'm really sorry if I'm getting overboard with this rant, but yup I'm just really jealous. I'm aware of this but it just irks me whenever this thought past through my head. I'm really sorry.

I could get out of a lot of things by saying ""something came up"" and most people would accept it but the truth is I just needed to be left alone. I just get these weird moments where I feel overwhelmed and just want it all to end...

But despite the occasional suicidal thoughts, low mood and absolute lack of motivation...I'm still passing through life pretty well. And I have been for the past 8 years? So it's really shocking to me when my younger brother came out and got diagnosed with depression.

Now I feel worse because I should have seen the signs that i myself once had. But even worse when I tried to bring it up he was so angry saying I shouldn't feign understanding because I wouldn't know what its like. And I don't. Not really. 

But now I don't know how to ever admit to anyone in going through problems when my parents are currently so busy with work and even reading up on how to helpmy brother and it just seems like, since I've survived this long, I can survive longer. Perhaps I'm not sick after all and I'm just extremely negative and unmotivated by nature...

I really don't get why people are assuming if they do their best, they would not have to bare the threat of global warming. The earth is dying. And such coincidence that a few weeks after that post, people are deliberately setting fire to the Earth's lungs. For money. backed by the president. If you had a choice to bring a life to earth to suffer, do you think it is worth it?

The world will not get better. No amount of education will stop corrupt people from making such decisions, and forcing the world to bare the consequences. 

It was originally a post about having a child, but it seems that the general public just don't give a damn about this, because they are ultimately not the ones that will suffer, but our children,  and their children. It sickens me. The world is dying and there is nothing we can do about it.

722,"Hi please dont filter this.

How do I introduce myself.... hmmm I am a guy, 21 this year and I am insecure about my height. 

Growing up hasn't been easy for me. I was, and I still am the shortest among my peers. I was constantly picked on, laughed at yada yada yada. My current height is 1.62 metre tall. In the eyes of the society and majority of the women out there, I am nothing but a midget. I am not up to the society/majority of the women's perceived standard of a desired man. This is understandable. I mean women are attracted to tall guy right. HAHAHA girls shorter than me also desire for a guy who's 1.75-1.8m tall. Let's be frank here. I am really unattractive. No matter what kind of quality I have, or how good my personality is, or how confident I am, I am invisible. I am like a ghost and that's really depressing. You know how society and the media always portray that a woman and a tall man will lead to happy ending. Whereas for short guy, there is little to no coverage. In the mind of many women, shorty is probably at the last of the line. Society can accept that a woman is short and shrug her off as being cute. A short guy that is below the average is automatically classed as a midget. If you're a short guy, you're not taken seriously....

To top it off, I am not really that good looking either. I just completed a course of Isotretinoin for my raging acne. Right now, on and off, my pimples would resurfaced and there are a lot of scars. This is a matter that I believe that I can resolve; since there are abundant of scar removal treatment in Singapore. 

As for my height, the cost itself for a limb lengthening surgery puts me off; not to mention the downtime. 

I know how some of you will say, ""there's nothing you can do; you should just accept who you are"". To be honest, I tried. I really tried. I am full of confidence until another guy tower over me. I don't mind sacrificing 10 years of my life just to be tall. At one point in time, I got so depressed that I wanted to end everything. What's the point of trying so hard to be confident and stuffs while nobody give a damn about you. Sadly, height is a determining factor in everything. It determines your odds of getting a partner, it determines your career pathway and how other sees you. I am not making this up; this is what i experienced.

723,"I feel like writing this down because I’ve seen too much information exchange going on between the students and the teachers on whispers about the fundamental programming modules. As a student who is at the end of the streamline and is about to become a finished product pushed to the job market, the posts reminded me of how I survived my first year of university here. And my reflection saddens me, not just because it is about a painful year, but more for a pre-mature me undergoing so much torture. Well, the torture indeed made me tougher and stronger (what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger lol), but I would appreciate it more if I was given more understanding and encouragement when I was deep in my struggle.

I remember the first lecture of my fundamental programming module gave me a blow right in my head. I just couldn’t get it when I heard “recursion/iteration is like induction, you just assume it works in the previous step, and it will work in the next step”. I became even more panicky when during the lesson right after the lecture, everyone else there seemed to know how to use recursion/iteration to solve the problems, as if their brains are dry sponges absorbing the knowledge instantaneously. I was so stunned when they solved the questions on the board with the things taught less than one hour ago, and even more stunned when there were people solving the questions using untaught techniques – for loops and while loops (these were some big wow to me because I never heard of them before…)! I just couldn’t understand how they got their solutions, or rather, why they are so freaking smart. I guess I looked too stunned. After a star student presented his answer, the teacher walked over, and asked me a question that I could finally understand. “You don’t understand anything, do you?” And with this question my stunned face was exposed to everyone in the room. Well, I really don’t understand anything, so I said, “no I don’t”. The teacher turned, and walked back to the board, “it’s ok, we are here to help you”. And there went more questions, and there went my totally shutdown brain.

That lesson ended at 3pm, and I went back home, sat down at my desk, and tried to figure out what the hell is recursion/iteration. It took me 10 hours to figure it out, and I remember the number of hours spent so clearly simply because I only left my chair at 1am with numb legs and a drained yet excited brain. It was really just what was taught, “recursion/iteration is like induction, you just assume it works in the previous step, and it will work in the next step”, but it took me 10 hours straight of thinking to absorb it. Now whenever I think of this experience, I am always so thankful that I figured it out just in time. I have seen people who didn’t try so hard and were left behind. I am thankful that it got the grit out of me, which would be necessary for me to survive the rest of my years in the university. But my practice is highly questionable, or rather, the motivation of my practice is highly questionable. What gave me the strength to think for 10 hours straight without eating, drinking or moving around? And why did I ask for help from my friends, when they seemed to understand the concept? I would say it was because of shame. I was afraid that people would say “it’s so easy, why don’t you just get it?” I was afraid to let other people know that I have become so “illiterate” and “dumb” when I used to be a top tier student. And I was afraid to get that question again, “you don’t understand anything, do you?”

And my shame was dismantled at the next lesson. The teacher gave us a question on the spot. He walked over to my desk (again), bent down, examined my solution, and then copied it to the board, “uhmmm, this looks pretty pedestrian.” I was stunned (again), because I didn’t know how to interpret the word “pedestrian”. Is it something like “路人甲” in Chinese (it means mundane and insignificant), or something else? And while I was thinking of the meaning of the word, a few of his favorite star students presented their solutions, “innovative”, as he branded them, but upon further scrutiny, failed. The teacher examined my solution on board again, “uhmmmm, seems like only the pedestrian way works.” I really felt like leaving the room at that instant. And that was the last time I appeared at his lesson. I thought, there is nothing to be shameful about. “Pedestrian” doesn’t mean I can’t win. I worked hard, I thought hard, and I got it right. If someone, especially an authority, brands me as “pedestrian”, gives me no faith from the start, the shame is not on me. 

The end of the story is not a fantastic one. I got B+ for this mod, and I had to S/U it. But does the B+ make me a less adequate programmer than a student who got A for this mod? No, as far as I can see, no. This mod is just about the fundamentals, the basics, the easiest things, of programming, and one day, it will become your second nature, just as easy as you speak and think in English. When I revised the material at the start at the next semester, I marveled at how stupid I was, why the hell did I spend 10 hours straight trying to figure out recursion, when it is just an induction??? But at the same time, I could still feel the pain of struggling and the fire of shame and anger that was burning inside me during those 10 hours. During these days when learning becomes a lot easier for me, I started reflecting on this experience. The most painful part for me of that mod was not the 30+ coding assignments, but the lack of faith in me, both by myself and by the teacher (at least that was how I felt). My confidence was shattered during that mod, and I tried so hard just to prove to whoever that I thought scorned upon me and gave up on me (well, myself included), that I can do it. I have to say it worked as a motivation, after all it got me learn how to work my ass off, but was it necessary for it to be so passive? Did I learn just for a proof of my capabilities, or for my future development, or for my interest, my passion? Does learning, especially for something that should be as easy as a second nature, have to be so painful? Would it be better if I had the courage to use more resources e.g. teachers friends families google etc.? Would I learn better if I didn’t get so angry to push myself to the dead-ends? 

There are so many what-ifs, but there is only one time that I undergo this process, and it shapes me to who I am now. I am thankful to this experience, but whenever I recall it, I really want to give a hug to the a-few-year-ago me, and let her know that things shouldn’t be so difficult, if it is, you are learning it the wrong way.

726,"By now you should have heard of the Malaysian girl saga. Basically she complained on her university's confession page that she had to eat cup noodles for a month after spending all her money to buy her friend a present. She then complained that her friend didn't do so in return, and only gave her birthday wishes a couple of days late. She then labelled her as a fake friend. Everyone seems to be supportive of the confessor, telling her to cut off her fake friend.

Am I the only one who thinks that the confessor is the toxic one? When you buy a friend (or anyone) a present, you should not expect anything in return. All you should hope for is that he or she will like what you bought for her. This goes the same for relationships. When a guy buys a handbag for his girlfriend, should he expect her to reciprocate somehow? Maybe some of you do, but when I buy my girlfriend a cup or bubble tea, I expect no more than seeing her smile and enjoy her drink. Scale that up to a thousand dollar gift and the principles should stay the same.

TLDR: The real ""fake people"" are those who have hidden agendas in everything they do.

I am not sure but why is there a need for me to purchase a textbook for a module especially if that textbook costs 70 over dollars? Is school fees not enough? From the lecturer, I heard that this year he is going to use a new textbook and thus all the old textbooks are of no use. Furthermore, the PDF versions of the textbook are not available as this is the first edition of the textbook. Does anyone have the PDF version? The textbook name is ""Organizational Behaviour: An Asian Perspective"".

But more importantly,  I googled the authors of the textbook and they all seem to faculty members of NUS Business School. Is this even legal? I mean not all students can afford it right? I come from a family where we are not really eligible for subsidies but that is because my dad has to take care of his parents and and many of his siblings too because he is the oldest child and this does not really qualify for subsidies, so we aren't exactly well-off. But the lecturer using a textbook and then saying he is not going to webcast this lecture just does not make sense. Why must I pay additional money on top of my school fees for materials and resources for a module that I take. 

Plus no offence to business students, but this is known as a ""fluff"" module and it teaches very soft-skill kinda things ,so how exactly must these things have changed to use a completely new textbook? It is not like a discovery has been made which makes all the current teachings obsolete etc?

The first round, the interviewers kept candidates waiting for two hours before their turn but it turned out to be a meet and greet. Second round, we waited before someone figured out that no personal interaction would take place that day, we just had an essay and IQ test to take. But the best was to come at the third round's detailed interview. The three stooges said successful candidates would have to shuttle between the airport terminal and the office/interview venue opposite Changi Beach, which was separated from the airport by the runway and security fence. They would provide no transport or assistance and we would have to to cab out of our own pocket. There was also a years long waiting list for parking there- even though they owned the building.

Friend A is my secondary friend and we have been friends for more than 6 years. For example: Picking up her call, meeting up in an unholy hour to chit-chat. Back then, I really appreciate her as a close friend and I am thankful that she will take up her time in the middle of the night to chat with me. 

As time goes by, meetups have become lesser due to her busy schedule. We only had frequents callings and she is usually whining about her workspace. I asked for her assistance for minor things such as referral codes. She rejected with reasonable reasons such as no apps. I understand that. Often, I asked her out. However, she rejected me with understandable reason. 

 Things started to go south when I was having financial difficulties. My family run into some problems and I asked her to borrow me some money. It is understandable if she is unwilling to borrow me $50-$100 as she might have difficulties and she does not earn much.

 I texted her again. I asked if she was willing to borrow me $20. She did not reply after constant texting. The next day, she went to the cafe which cost around $20. She was a full-timer. From that time onwards, she did not text me. I was hoping she asked about the condition of my house. I was disheartened.  Her actions have stabbed my heart.

It was all a test and I was lying about my financial difficulties. One thing for sure: I will lend her money if she needs $100. I will lend to her despite earning a penny. (part-time job)
It got me to think if she was just using me as a punchy bag/find me during her spare time.

However, after I went to an orientation camp, one particular guy in my og caught my eye. He looks like an ah beng (I think he's hot, but this may just be my own opinion) but is actually evergreen, to my surprise. I've had an ex who was actually one, and he was abusive and manipulative for the few months we were together. I was too naive in secondary school and thought I could 'tame' his wild behaviour. After I broke up with him, in JC I got together with my current boyfriend who was the 'guai' type, focused on studies, no clubbing, drinking, gambling, whatever. I'm instantly attracted to his appearance and vibe, but pushed those thoughts to the back of my mind since I was attached. We talked during the camp, but didn't contact each other privately after camp. I can't stop thinking of him. When uni started, I hoped I could bump into him on campus. We did, he said hi and I said hi back and we went our separate ways, as we were in different courses in the same faculty.

Please la, edurec don't even tell us how many vacancies are left for each module/tutorial, how are we supposed to know which modules are already full?!!ANY MODULE CAN BE FULL SO PEOPLE WHO SAY ""Oh, you are supposed to know which module is full"" can go and stfu because the whole thing would be simpler if NUS could just show the vacancy left during module bidding and this would make things 10000x for students. Now, they want students to play a guessing game to see which module they can get in. Isn't that such a waste of time? Right now that module registration round 3 has ended, i dont even know what to do. Appealing takes up such a long time just for the result to be out and i dont even know if i can get into any module. By then even if i can get the module, i will miss out alot because i confirm miss some lectures and tutorials already.

743,"Do people change from being an extrovert to an introvert without experiencing any life changing event? 

I've (21F) been in a rs with this guy (21M) since JC2. And back then, before he got enlisted, I was rather extroverted, or should i say i was leaning towards the extroverted side of the scale. However, as i grew older, i realised that i really enjoy spending my time alone. I enjoy watching movies alone, studying alone, taking short walks/ bus rides/ grabbing home alone. Plus i take afternoon naps regularly these days. Its just my way of relieving stress.

Yet, my boyfriend doesnt seem to fancy my change and so, our rs has been going through some rough times ever since he ORDed. He mentioned that he doesnt feel like he is being needed and that i dont love him as much. But everytime i see him, i still feel happy and blessed just that it tires me whenever i need to interact with ppl/ go out for long hours. Even for friends, im also not the one who jio people out, i just wait for them to jio me, but it doesnt affect our friendship in any way. I also havent made any friends in my 2 years of uni, all of them are hi bye. Cant seem to find the energy and motivation to interact with others. Im quite satisfied with my current social circle. Not sure if this is due to his enlistment, im used to spending time alone and only seeing him once a week, hence im fine with continuing this pattern. Ive spoken to him before and already gave in by spending more time (having dates after school, allowing him to fetch me after school etc) as i feel like some of his points were valid. But whenever he starts to doubt my love for him, i feel like ive committed a crime. 

I feel so helpless at times as i cant deny that i enjoy alone time but it my bf doednt accept this change in me. Sometimes i even wonder if i should continue this rs.

744,"I am going on SEP soon and upon return, I need to start my IA. At the time when I book my return flight ticket, the IA Official start date is not yet updated by the school so I tried guessing the start date to be the on the third week of Jan judging by the current IA start date. Less than 1 month to my SEP, I received an email informing students about IA start date which would be on the SECOND week of Jan. So I emailed the faculty to ask if the start date of IA could be postponed by a week and the faculty said that the school allows it.

Me being a very guai kid, I emailed my own department as well,asking to start my IA 1 week later while explaining the reason. However, the dept told me that I SHOULD have checked with the Dean's office if I cannot find it online (And yes, I do not know that.) Upon further pleading, the dept told me that *all students have to abide by the school rules.* (Word for word) (Btw, PLEASE send me the SCHOOL RULES)

I understand from seniors that the dept may do so due to insufficient number of profs going round for IA and now the dept wish to standardise all the official start and end dates for IA. However, I dont see why it is SO FREAKING HARD for the dept to allow me to postpone my start date to be 1 week later when the faculty allows for it BUT MY DEPT does not allow, like now (They allowed it for Sem 1 IA).

Since IA is more like between the student and the company itself, I am very frustrated that MY OWN DEPT is making things hard for me when the faculty says it can be done (Upon further confirmation, the faculty says *needs your dept approval*. Shouldn’t the school be helping the students in terms of need?

745,"When I see you and your section mates in BMT being so close and bonded, I feel so insecure and pathetic. You are able to meet them every week, going out together even on the late midnight and its a close group and not just a few of you. While on my side, I don't know why my section feels so weak. 

I always heard that people you met on BMT would be one of the closest people since it was the first stage of army life. But my section was so different. They quarrel among each other, there were a few outcasted because of their mindset and how they bring down the others. Personal things happen here and there. 

Why is my section just so different? In all honesty I feel like we are the only section that did not have a group photo... all we had among the 16 people, was just some scattered friendships here and there.

It is too late already considering that was a few years ago. But seeing how close you are with your BMT friends. Wow the amount of insecurity. I am so worried that you may leave me for your new friends.

746,"hey guys, been feeling a little down lately. life's okay & tbh, i come from a family with decent upbringing, my parents care a lot for me, grades are okay-ish & above all this, i ought to be grateful for what i have & the fact that i have a home to come to. 

But things haven't been working out for a while & are starting to catch up with me. (Am a current undergrad, just to set the context!) I've always been a quiet guy & never the outspoken type & i make a few friends here & there, but because of mistakes i've made, how uncaring & unthoughtful of a friend i've been, not being there at certain times, i find them slowly drifting apart from me. i believe i've gone through a short period of depression although i've never wanted to confirm with a healthcare professional & i don't wanna seem to jump on the bandwagon of mental illness, etc.

I feel like this depression has affected me severely & i can't mingle around with people like I used to, it's very difficult for me to initiate conversations & i just don't leave a lasting impression on anyone.

I see people on social media hanging out with friends & doing all this fun social stuff & i just feel so down. No one really reaches out to me via text & i know i should not always sit on my bum & wait for others to text me & yeah, i've been trying to get out of this hole i got into & socialise more & more & things have been picking up a bit. 

God knows how painful this whole process has been for me & i don't have a partner to confide in, i don't always want to rely on my parents because they're getting really old & i just don't want to worry them anymore. It breaks my heart seeing them not the way they were before, age is catching up with them. I'll keep trying my best but there's so much on my plate right now I feel :( 

Just glad I have a platform to pen my thoughts, wishing you guys the best & thank you for taking the time to read this :)

752,"My girlfriend cheated on me during her exchange, having sex with a random guy and travelling all over the continent with him all while I was deluded into thinking that she was focusing on her studies. I eventually found out but chose to forgive her after months of quarrels, and she seemed remorseful and eager to change for the better. 

Choosing to stay together with her was a ridiculously painful choice, like someone was constantly shoving shards of glass into my heart. Every new loving memory crafted with her was clouded by the painful remnants from being treated like a plaything. While doing mundane things like brushing my teeth or commuting on the train, my brain would suddenly be flooded with memories of what happened back then, and I would be overcome with emotion and just break down. A very sorry sight to see on the train indeed. 

My emotional health is in pieces... But I still love her. I really do. I believe that I am willing to die for her. There are moments when everything seem to be back to normal, back to the days before she indulged in adultery and we were just a young couple in love. The illusion fades away as quickly as it blossoms. These emotional scars will probably never fully heal as long as we are still together.

But yet I do not want to leave her. I know that I’ve been majorly cucked, but I do not want to leave her even though I am in so much pain. A war rages on inside me between logic and emotion. A pyrrhic victory is the only possible outcome.

Dear NUSWhispers, have any of you stayed together despite your partner cheating on you? How did you deal with it? Are you still happy now?

I feel like I’m slowly falling apart. All that will remain will be a sad, empty husk. Pitiful wisps left over from a foolish romantic who just wanted true love.

753,"What makes a “good” prof or a “bad” prof?

Taking this module a heard a few classmates complaining that they’ve heard from seniors about how “bad” this prof is at teaching. 

As I proved further, the reasons cited were that he doesn’t provide past year papers, doesn’t give guidelines on what’s gonna be tested and what’s not, and lastly sets exam questions that completely catches everyone off guard. And so these students think that he’s “bad” because, well, he doesn’t prepare us sufficiently for the exams. 

Yet this is exactly why I feel he’s great - this should be how modules are taught. 

Too often students are overly concerned about taking exams and neglecting the true purpose of learning. Guess what, when you start working, there’s no “right” answer - more often than not, the projects you work on are open ended, and it’s up to you to discern the relevant information and come up with solutions. Nobody’s gonna hold your hand and guide you along, telling you exactly what you should do. 

And that’s why I feel all profs should be like this. Because that would be fair to everyone: no hints, no narrowing down of chapters, no practice papers, and lastly, the format of the questions can catch you completely off guard. Because this would be true learning, a test of whether you’ve understood the concepts, rather that just studying for an exam. And this mirrors the real world more closely, where things are dynamic and unpredictable. 

What do you think?

P.S. I’m someone who leaves it to reading week before starting to study, and thus far I’ve been getting by with decent grades which I’m satisfied with (high Second Upper).

Some of them would den share about how their friend/relative/ spouse are doing well in that profession 

So I would tell them that I didn't like the shift work, or the fast pace environment. 

Little do they know the real reason. In fact even my parents dun know e real reason.  I was molested when I was younger. 

I didnt know that I was that affected though. I was still able to hang out and talk to the opposite gender alone.

Yet I didn't know the experience affected me that much. I was able to survive e first two years. When I was in the male ward I would be showering the patients with a staff. 

Once I had to sponge a patient with the sister because the ward was so busy and severely short handed. I stood in the cubical with the trolley and suddenly I froze. 

The sister got irritated and berated me. Looking back I think being in the cubical alone with e half naked pt brought back memories and I was going through a lot of family issues at that time and didn’t really had an adult to talk to about it.

I dun know why I’m even sharing this on such a platform, but I just wanna say that there are more than what’s meet the eye.

I know that it was ended up with a very bad condition where I didn’t even talk to him at all. And I don’t know whether he is bi or what, but to be honest, there is no such friend would do extra miles like the normal couple did. But in the end, he never admit it to me at all.

Sometimes, the feeling of guilt dominates my thought where I am always feel that I disturb his time and breaching his space despite he is the one did it most of the time after the confession. But truthfully, there is no single anguish came out from him except for copious cursatives he said unto me which is normal to me.

I love being together with him and I don’t need him to do alot of extra miles for me, just being himself present in front of me should be enough. But now, his presence makes me more angry even though he was not in the same dept as mine since I transferred out, because for all the things that he did to me which was ended up so badly. 

Perhaps there is abit of anguish came out from my own self due to all the things that happened between us, but my love for him never fade. That is the one last thing I told him before I transferred out from my old dept, I told him that I loved him. I walked away with a heavy feelings, looking at his glistening eyes that tells his own unspeakable mixed reaction. He knows that I loved him and he did loved me but only as a good friend (or perhaps, he didn’t want to admit it to me).

Firstly, what is wrong with using vulgarities if it is not used to scold or insult others? It is simply a way of expression, albeit a crude one. You can say that NTU students are vulgar, crude, inappropriate, but how is using vulgarities in a cheer immoral? How are they ”下流” (despicable)? They are undergraduates, not monks or nuns. Some of them might not even be virgins. Don’t be such a prude. 

Secondly, no one got hurt in the process and no one got pregnant in the process. So don’t act like it is such a big deal.

Third: if you think that our local unis aren’t good enough because of this, then send your child/go to a private or overseas uni; don’t come to a local uni. Some overseas unis have hazing activites where sexual acts were performed between students or students actually die.

It is all started when I was working and on that day there are a group of students been interned to our dept. Usually I am like-I-care person and just doing my job over and over again. Until one day, I was having some issue on job and on of the guy intern helping solving the issue. I was so thankful to him but as I say, I just continue my work as usual.

But this guy ah, keep on talking to me but of course he kept introduced himself to me and we exchange numbers after. It was my first time even since I started working, I am contacting some intern student. So we messaged and call each other quite frequent. We hang out alot as well. Got one day when we hangout tgt, I asked him whether he got gf or not and he said he did, so there goes my hope. Haha. Until the day of his last internship, I was abit sad lorrr. Aftr that, I didnt contact him anymore. 

Until half a yr after, I saw he came back to our dept with a shirt and semi formal wear, I was abit shocked. He came to me and said he’s been accepted to work in same dept as me. And I was like “oh shit, there goes my love life”. So we started to contact each other again and he vid called me almost every night up to 5 hours! I was abit weird that why would he spent his time on me as he himself got a gf. So i asked him direct “how are you and your gf?”

He said “we broke up already straight after we finished school”. And i was like “Damn!”

I didnt even know how to say but we went for a meal quite a lot, we went to watch movie quite frequent, not to forget the couple seat. I dun even know whether he liked me back or not but all he did to me is like someone the couple did. But I dont want to think alot about as I prefer the latter to initiate the move. So at one point of time during christmas, we were asking each other what we want for christmas and apparently he said he wants me for his christmas and suddenly he act cute after. I said to him to stop it because he is meddling with my feelings. 

In the end, i told him that i liked him and i loved him. And that is where all the awkwardness started. I started to avoid myself from him and started to stop texting to him. After that he started to contact me again and started to talk with me again. We do the same routine over and over again, without thinking on that day. He never said anything about the day i confessed to him because i dun want it affect our relationship at work. 

Months by months passed, our relationship worsen and we argued alot on the phone. I didnt even talked to him during work. Only after 2 years of knowing each other, we did a closure tgt which was failed miserably. In the he told me he dont like me and only treated me as a friend. And what kind of friend who called me up for hours and bring me for a meal secretly without ppl in our workplace knowing about it.

In the end, I ended up requested to transferred out from my old dept and move to the new one for the sake of my own self to be happy during work without presence of him. Honestly I gave up alot of things to make myself happy again. But out of all things, I would never forget what he told me after all he did: He dont like me because I am a guy too.

772,"I'm not remotely involved in orientation and have never been an ogl, but I think it's honestly terrible how all university students are painted with a broad brush like kindergarten kids in much of the media, especially with the recent post about NTU's orientation. I know there are those who may say it's just NTU's turn to get grilled and it's not our problem, but in my view not only is there nothing for us to gloat about, but it is in our best interest to have their back.

Some stuff is inappropriate, and I'm all in favour of education such as classes raising awareness about sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour, especially over what has happened over the past few months.

Just look at the comments section in any article talking about orientation, and so some are asking for it to be scrapped altogether just because of a few bad actors. We are regressing into a path of no return. Let's be clear, when you have 30k+ people, sometimes there are bad apples, but collective punishment and the restriction of freedom should not be the solution just because it's easier for someone to go to that podium or newspaper and say ""We did something."" True, decisive measures need to be taken because they are so overdue, but this doesn't mean you rush through without considering if these measures really tackle the root causes. If they don't, you're just complicit in letting nasty things continue to happen in the future.

Everyone needs to realise the freedoms to behave like young adults must never be taken for granted. If we hand over the argument to the keyboard warriors about orientation today, it will be the beginning of the end of whatever limited freedoms we have today and we'll be on the road to turning Singapore universities no different from regimented military camps, which is not going to be pleasant as I can attest first-hand.

PGPR is not a representation of Singapore or NUS. I’m a archi student and I can confidently say that there wasn’t much thought process when they constructing this place. It’s poorly designed in so many ways. It’s a maze here - a new person can never find their room, bedrooms are poorly ventilated - always smelly when you check-in, bedroom’s thin walls seep water when it rains, bedroom windows are not too many and poorly designed, no handicap accessibility at the drop-off point, or even luggage friendly - student need to carry luggage down unless they miraculously find their way to the basement carpark and then take a lift up to mgmt office, toilets are crappy - looks like old part of vietnam, the function rooms are in the basement with no windows (always have a smell), MPH is also in the basement with no accessibility for the disabled, and when it rains you can’t get to the MPH - I almost fell once  avoiding the rain. Has the Senior Mgmt visited PGPR unofficially or always hosted to the best spots? Our Campus Infrastructure department headed by Prof Yong Kwet Yew, has he seen his product? Ask him to come down by himself and find Blk 21 and then also enter a Type C room and stay there for a night. I see the poor maintenance and housekeepers repairing & cleaning all the time but the fact remains that infrastructure plays an important part. PGPR is like an old 50 year old beat up car that the mgmt expects the mechanics to keep washing and servicing while expecting it to perform like a 5 year old car? And the poor staff always have to work hard just to explain the condition of the estate. I mean to be fair, there are renovation plans but it’s 2019. It’s taking a TOP University so long just to realise their mistake and renovate so late? Home is where the heart is and OHS says “creating homes on campus”. This is by far the worst home and those responsible for building such an infrastructure should not be working here. An inquiry should be setup for the team who approved this design. There are many shortfalls in the construction. Renovation can rejuvenate the place but it doesn’t excuse those who build such a poor residence.

780,"Why do girls think guys should make the first move, and if they don’t, get a stamp on the face smack center that “guys r really dumb- giving subtle hints like crazy also dun get it”? Do guys deserve such short sighted judgement, if you think of all the teasing sg gals pepper on guys? 

Consider the following scenarios. Tell me why this would mean it is a hint for the guy to confess since gal is interested. 

1. Gal chats with guy everyday. Have lunch, meet for movies and find nice places to eat. Meets on weekend, even goes to ECP. 
2. Gal drops by abruptly out of nowhere, say hi and infront of ppl she dunno, she suddently squeeze into the coffee table to do small chats with that guy only, literally kicks all other convo with his friend out of the window and it is all about her feelings, then abruptly say she buy and leaves - but after presentinf little gifts for him- but not handmade. Same Gal tell the guy lets go watch a movie together in front of everyone but takes 100 messages just to pin down a day for the movie, which turns into a breakfast lunch dinner movie time that gets cancelled several times with more apologies and more small gifts. 
3. Gal makes handmade cookies and gives guy regularly. Many times the cookies are heart shaped. She does not appear to cook specifically for the guy, but gives the impression she does. She seems not to realise that it is possible to peek into her bag when she takes out her cookies to see more cookies in there, nicely wrapped. 
4. Gal calls up guy for lunch almost every day, but cancels regularly, saying got this guy with Ferrari want to buy her lunch, but he keep canceling. 
5. Gal who regularly meet for lunch suddenly confides about how her finances are in trouble because an “unknown” sponsor only gives her $1,000 a month and she cannot afford to go on studying like that and was wondering if the guy can chip in another $1,000. 
6. Gal sees guy in a bus stop opposite, walk over just to say hi, small chats and even takes the bus to an MRT in the opposite direction saying she got time. But till now still haven’t exchanged numbers. 

Well let me tell you: NONE of these girls are dropping hints to start a relationship. They are just trying out stunts to see if they can elicit some kinda response from a guy, anywhere from “hey, can I meet you again” to “baby, I can’t stop time but I can stop you from leaving”, only to shove a power move called *WTF-blush-and-nevertalktomeagain-kthxbye,next* move. 

So what does guy do? “Well that was fun. Another time. Cheers!” ... and maybe she will msg again, maybe not. 

I know how this works because... not to be flexing but I always had girls lining up to pick from, but I know they are all just doing their 어장관리. I am fine with that. Having lunch with nicely dolled up gals is always a better deal than eating alone. 

Let me lazer in here for the guys on how to know yr gal got some feeling. 

Here is the thing: money talks. If a girls buys the meal, she is interested in you, and if u want to confess, she may or may not reject but she won’t do a ego trip on power play to hurt you, and the friendship can continue as if the confession did not happen (but dun ever confess again, although she will confess if she wants later on, maybe long after). Reason being that gals will NEVER spend money on a guy who they have zero feelings for. You cannot guilt trip a gal to spend money on you. She will spend money on you because she likes you. Maybe not enough to start a relationship possibly, but definitely enough to care for your ego being broken if you confess. If she writes love poem or make handmade origami with something written in it and lots of heart sign, that is not hint alr its confession hor, even if the content is only abt the weather or poem like “mice loves rice like I love u”. 

Ah yes, I forgot. If you don’t have girls lining up to have lunch with you, please ignore this post and study hard for level 1 pak-tor modules, this is level 4 module tips on choosing girl to BTO. 

Btw just to clear the air on getting a BTO: if u r from a really rich family, u will be forced to get a HDB by yr parents so as to learn to live humbly AND so that money does not poison their grand children or yr wife. So stop being so shallow and write off everyone in HDB as ppl who can’t afford condos. I could pay the downpayment for a condo just by saving up my allowance for a couple of months. Yeah I take bus 95 like the rest of you and don’t waste money on depreciating asset like cars even when I can afford an X5, because having money to burn does not mean you should burn it.

Not allowed to overload, either, because ‘CAP too low’. I need to overload in the first place because see above. 

Then it screws up my priority for CS2100, and then I’m stuck with 16 MCs. At this rate, I can graduate in 2023 (or get booted out because I’ll take too long to graduate), and NUS gets an extra $10K. Well done.

785,"Hello I am a freshman and ModReg is making me super confused. Perhaps someone can help me out?

When we were selecting our modules in the previous rounds, we could see the vacancy, popularity, and add reserve classes (in case we don't get the mods we want).

This time round when we are selecting tutorials, we can't seem to add reserve tutorials, nor see the popularity of certain tutorial slots? This makes it so difficult and confusing to operate ModReg, especially since some of my mods have tutorial slots with vacancies of 6, and not being able to see the popularity makes things so hard?

So to replicate the functionality of the ""add reserve tutorials"", am I supposed to just tick all the tutorial slots from the same timeslot and rank all of them?

It's actually quite frustrating that the UI is so unintuitive and the documentation is not helpful at all.

I like modest girls and have only mostly dated girls who are the kind who save sex for after marriage and I'm fine with that. I don't think of them sexually or fantasize about having sex with them. The same problem happen with crushes, I do not have sexual attraction to the kind of girls that I develop crushes on.

However, I turn to porn and pictures and videos of girls in skimpy, slutty outfits that they wear to clubs and masturbate to them instead. When I see girls post images of them in revealing pictures of themselves in skimpy/slutty outfits on Instagram, I get turned on sexually but turned off emotionally. When I get to know a girl and find her Instagram, I will check if she posts those kind of pictures and if she does, I immediately lose interest in developing anything more than friendship. This also has to do with a bad past experience when I dated a girl that had those kind of pictures and I thought that ""she was special"" or ""this time its different"" but it turned out that I was thinking with my emotions and we ended up breaking up because of our different sexual beliefs and thoughts on modesty.

I do not want to date or have sex with just like that, they are just masturbation material to me. I wouldn't cheat on my girlfriend or wife but I will masturbate.

Please advise, thank you.

And just today, while I passed by the pianos and tried to play, a family came to the other piano and the kids were slamming the keys with their hands. I tried to ignore them and continue playing and suddenly the boy came to me and slam the piano I was playing instead. Surprised at the child’s rude behaviour, I looked to the parents, and his mum was recording him slamming the piano I was at, like it’s going to be their childhood memories videos for them to look back on 20 years later. I asked the mother if she could ask her kid to go play the other piano (which her other kid daughter is destroying) and I got ignored, including the grandmother who was smiling and seemingly happy that they raised their kid to destroy public property. 

I get that whole “music is for everyone” kind thing but obviously some people are uncultured swines with demon spawns, whom definitely do not deserve to have access to expensive instruments or equipments of any sort placed in public. 

Does anyone know the contact of the people in charge of the piano? Is it by SRC committee or a club? Hope to write to them if they can maybe shift them to places where only students can access. 

Kinda sad to see perfectly functioning stuff getting ruined by kids raised by inconsiderate insensible adults.

In secondary school I got close to this guy and we started texting a lot. We would text all night till late and continue in school (either teasing each other in real life or texting). We talked for hours about anything and everthing. He was so sweet to me . We were best friends but tbh we were close to crossing the boundaries between friendship and bgr. I really like him and I think he did too. But things got downhill.

Everyone started shipping us and things got awkward in real life. Whenever we talk or seen together in real life, friends around us would ship. It got so bad that even our teachers knew and people from different classes knew about it as well. Gradually, our texts also got lesser and we slowly drifted. We were still close but not as close anymore. After a year we stopped talking completely. My friends would tell me to move on, but I couldn't. I think it has been around 4 years since we talked, but I am still not over him. I heard he got a girlfriend now while I'm a single pringle all this while. 
Maybe you will say that was my own fault for not taking the initiative etc. I did, but we got so awkward because of all the shipping that we would be so cautious in talking to each other and became distant. So here I am walloping in heartbreak. Maybe I need closure, but I will never know if he liked me ☹

798,"Okay, first of all, I'm not from NUS but my boyfriend was from NUS and he often visit this page. Recently he posted a confession here and I guess this is my response back.

*Potential trigger warning*

Babe, I'm sorry for all the pain I've caused you since the beginning of our relationship. I sincerely appreciate how loving and doting you are towards me and I love you lots too. I notice every little tiny yet significant effort you've put in for me and from the bottom of my heart, thank you so much. There isn't any problem with our love. There's no doubt that we love each other so much but, in this love, it doesn't bring you happiness.
I know I sound cliché like, "" It's not you, it's me"" or ""You'll be much happier without me."" but that is what I truly feel right now. Yes, it's selfish for me. I know that in a relationship, we are a team. We need to work together to make this relationship work. However, before I can fight together with you for this relationship to work, I've my own battles to fight. I'm struggling and I'm losing the battle. I've expressed my agony fighting with my depression, eating disorder and anxiety to you and it breaks me to see you being affected as you hear me speak. I understand that mental health might be much too complicated of a topic for you and I don't expect you to help me solve the problem. I mean, even I can't find the solution even after battling it with it for about 5 years now. On top of my inner struggles, my parents are f**ked up too. I know you hate them for not responding to my cries and constantly venting their anger and frustrations on me. Babe, thank you. Thank you for being angry for me. It really mean a lot to me, honestly. It make me feel this warm fuzzy feeling in my heart because you're the first person in my life that ever cared for me. However, like I said, it hurts me to see you being affected by my problems. Yes, I know that we're a couple, it's only normal for me to sympathize and be affected when I see you suffering but no. I mean, since young, I've been constantly being 'abused' by my parents and it's a norm. But for you, it's not so you're not used to it. And now that I'm also struggling with mental illnesses, the burden you are probably feeling is 10times more than it already was. Although I am barely functioning, I can still fake a smile. But, it's a ticking time bomb. Suicidal thoughts is also a norm for me. So, attempts are always going to happen. Yes, it's stupid, I hear you. I am clearly aware of all the possible consequences I might face. I'm sorry but sometimes it's not about what I know, sometimes the urges are just way too loud. Babe, I know you don't understand why the hell I am doing this but, when I start to feel suicidal or depressed or when I know I'm relapsing, I start to push you away not because I don't love you. In fact, it's quite the opposite actually. I love you too much to see you get hurt. I know I say a lot of nasty things to you when that happens but that is because I don't want you to get caught up in the midst of the chaos. You've gone through enough already and you should just take a break. I'm a mess and I don't want you to see me like this. Maybe after the break you'll love me lesser....? So if I killed myself, you'll be able to move on much quicker and easier as compared to if you're still as madly in love with me like I am. (Ah yes, comments, I can hear people's knuckles cracking already) I know it's f**ked up for me to think like this but honestly does anyone relate? Is this something like a normal feeling someone else feel too or am I just an alien? Cheh, just kidding haha... 
Babe, sometimes I wonder if your life would be much happier if I died. Like, you no longer have to worry about me anymore. Like, this burden (me) will no longer be there. 
Sometimes I wonder if you'll be much happier if your girlfriend is a much more of a normal one. 
Maybe I sound like I don't love you, but I do. I love you so much. You're the first and last person I think about every day. When I at the edge of killing myself, simply thinking about you makes my heart ache so much. I hate that I love you so much that you can stop me. But I can't live on being like this anymore. I want to end this endless, torturous, bl**dy agonizing life but time and time again you stopped me. Why? I'm sorry if I sound ungrateful but it hurts. This is a living hell, stop letting me breathe...Stop loving me. Stop giving me a reason. (Okay, okay, I can hear people screaming through their screens already. Sorry people.)
Many of you may suggest seeking professional help but personally it is not an option for me. 
1. I did seek help and they said that they will get back to me in 2 weeks time. (Great, totally useful with the fact that I almost had a full suicide attempt today.)
2. My parents is very traditional so mental health is not a thing. They always say ""why are you sad? You got things to be sad about meh?"" Or they will tell me stories of how much worser other people lives are which makes me feel even worse for feeling this way. So every time when I suggest that maybe I should find help, they will disagree and oppose the idea.
3. I am terrified of the hospital. As much as people tries to sugar coat about IMH or whatsoever, I have heard countless personal recounts about how horrid it actually is. So, god, no...
4. Medication side effects. Medication for mental health are extremely complicated and each individual requires different amount of dosage. Or, many medication just have side effects and they sometimes causes new symptoms to pop out. Personally, I hate medicine too so, double no no.
5. Costs. (I think this speaks for itself.)

My mum died when I was in Y1 (Freshie). Barely three months later, my dad re-married: My new stepmum is one of my JC seniors (same CCA). As you can imagine, the wedding ceremony was hilarious. At least the man had the decency to hold a private ceremony  so few outsiders know about his disgusting activities. 

Since my stepmum is one year older than me, she was still in Y4 while I was in Y1 (yay NS). Hence, we were supposed drive together to and fro from school. My stepmum knew that things were awkward between us, so she tried to bridge the gap by spending more time with me in the canteen/library/school events etc. There soon emerged a vicious cycle: the more she tried to reach out to me, the more I pulled away. The more I pulled away, the more she tried to reach out to me. Before long, she began spending so much time with me that I felt completely suffocated. I also broke up with my GF during that period when she saw my stepmum's personal items in the car. Everyone thought I was two-timing my ex with ""that Year 4 bitch"" and many bridges were burned in my social circle.

I thought my troubles were over when my stepmum finally graduated. I was wrong. My stepmum gave birth to a baby. I can't stand the baby's incessant crying, so I started spending more time in school to avoid coming home. I very rarely meet my family noawadays, and most of my ""family time"" consists of me babysitting while my parents go on overseas holidays.

I feel so miserable at home right now. It is national day weekend and everyone else is spending quality time with their families, but here I am babysitting again while my parents are on holiday in Greece. Family rumor is that my stepmum is pregnant again, and the man is obviously very happy about it. 

I wish that the weekend would be over ASAP so I have an excuse to avoid coming home again.

Now that i've started working for less than a month I feel that they've started to become really cold to me. They've been in a hurry to hand the bills over to me (which I do agree I should pay) but on top of that they have asked (almost demanding) a $1000 a month from me...

I don't make much at this stage and I can't afford that $1000 a month, it's almost half my monthly paycheck. The thing is my parents are well off in the first place and they are still making money (lots of it). I just don't know why given their circumstance they feel that it is rightful to burden me financially as such so early on. Worst is my brothers who make more than me contribute a lot less than a $1000 and it's certainly a smaller percentage of their income. Sometimes I feel that it's the people around my mum that is influencing her thinking. They make a lot of nasty comments about their own children and while she criticize that, she is starting to act and think like them unknowingly.

I have a gf and have plans to settle down in the future. Getting married is expensive and having a kid in the future only means I've got to start saving now. 

At this stage when my savings is low, how is it that I can afford everything? I pay for all the dates with my gf while I eat hawker/food court daily and not spend on myself at all.

Throughout my life, i had been complimented many times about my good looks. Frankly speaking, i has always enjoy the attention from girls.

Fast forward i am now attached and started working. However, i still get such attention from girls even when i said i am attached. And ever since working it has gotten worse and is bothering me.

The girls at my office,colleagues, superiors and clients started adding me on facebook, getting my contacts by asking me or others and also asking me out. All these i can try to ignore and avoid.

However,some girls are making unnecessary contact which i do not know is it harassment.
Whenever, i tell them that i am uncomfortable, they will just say is their habit or simply calling me paranoid. Shortly after, they just do it again. And friends will just deemed it as me flexing or joking. it also doesnt help that i am rather mild-mannered and soft spoken.

Examples of contact made:
1) Colleague A will come to my desk area to smell my neck and hair from the back. She will say things like hmm smell great today i like it. (I have put a mirror just so i can see people coming) But sometimes, i didnt see her coming if i was too focus.
2) Colleague B likes to hug my arm while walking or on trains. Now i am more cautious about where i am positioned so that she dont have the chance to.
3) Colleague C likes to randomly takes pictures of me and post in whatsapp group. she also likes to drink from my bottle/cup to see what i am  drinking without even asking. This is less annoying compared to the rest.
4) My manager always like to touch me when talking. Like putting her chin on my shoulder and touching the fabric of my shirt. She also likes to make suggestive comments like the air con is cold today are you feeling aroused? Or hey you are sweating want me to help you take off your shirt etc. She only started to behave like this recently.

The list goes on and there are worse things that i feel are inappropriate to share. These instances occur over my temp jobs and my current job. As my section is mostly girls and only 3 guys. But i am usually the target of the teasing. It is hard for me to blast at them as it will be hard for me to work with them. And i get it too during my intern and temp jobs,so i am not sure if changing job will work. So i am not sure is it something wrong with me or i am too paranoid. 
Some of them just got so bad in the conversation that i had to find excuse of being unwell or saying i am busy.

It really disturbs me greatly and i am kinda stuck and lost. I told my gf about it and she is angry too that this is happening but feels as helpless as me. 

Please help me as i am feeling very stressful at work.=(

Lost and stressed.

People should work less hard, ditch the focus on materialism and return to the simple way of life. In that way, everyone will be much happier.

815,"This is how an NUS student goes from being a open-minded individual, with a far-reaching outlook, to becoming a working adult whose life is..... just ""another working millenial"". NOTE: Does not apply to every Singapore or NUS graduate.

Our society has a huge focus on materialism, because we are a capitalist society, and our economy depends on it. However, it is the people at the top of the food chain, the crazy rich, who drive the material culture. Historically, exclusivity and luxury was only for the rich, because only they can afford it. But now that the middle class in SG have more disposable income, the rich create middle class luxury. So Singapore has a highly communal society. That is to say, we do everything in conscious or subconscious desire that our peers will accept us. Because rejection from our peers is painful. So when you mix community and material, what do you get? The chase for material in order to gain the approval of peers, justified as a form of morality. Not every working, middle class Singaporean behave as such. However, it is rampant. It is very easy to get caught up in such a culture, if the people around you participate in it. And after a few years, an NUS graduate can forget all about ""making the world a better place"", or ""making people's lives better"". This coupled with the pressure to settle down and have family, makes it even easier to morally justify the pursuit of material wealth. You need material so that your family can have a better life. And if you have to sacrifice your soul for it, is that noble? Therefore, the pursuit of material wealth, in the name of your family's well-being, is not only acceptable to your community. But it is also accetable to your self and your moral values. And your kids will learn this from you and become like you. Forget about ""making the world a better place"". Like seriously, Silicon Valley invented that mantra, but that place is really all about money as well.

However I failed the placement test and now I am too lousy to be in level 2, but too good to be in level 1. So now, I have to somehow hit level 2 on my own, retake and pass the placement test before I can study Korean in school.

I know level 1 is for absolute beginners but since I can't hit the standards of level 2 why am I not allowed to take level 1 just because I have prior knowledge that I put in effort to learn on my own? Why am I being ""punished"" for trying to study by myself? The only thing I regret now is learning on my own because now I can't take any module to learn the language in school.

I am extremely frustrated at NUS' policy of not letting students overload in Year 1 Sem 1. Why? Let me tell you.

However, they told me ""Strictly no overloading in year 1 sem 1."" and advised me to DROP A MODULE. What the hell is this?? You are telling me to FALL BEHIND MY COURSEMATES BY 1 MODULE!!

827,"I broke up with my ex-bf over the holiday break. The circumstances of the breakup are rather complicated, but that is not the point of this confession. 

The problem I am currently facing is this: Last semester, me and my ex did it in one of the lecture halls, a tutorial room, a staircase, between the bookshelves in one of the libraries, and some other locations around campus. At that time, I thought it was just harmless fun. It recently struck me that at least some of those places might have CCTVs installed. I am quite worried now. I really don't want the footage to be leaked and cause a scandal, especially since me and my ex are no longer together. Furthermore, my current bf is the conservative prudish type: I had to convince him that I was a virgin before he was willing to go steady with me. Even today, in our daily interactions, I put in the effort to mantain a ""guai schoolgirl"" persona. I really don't want all my efforts to go to waste through no fault of my own. 

Is it safe for me to do nothing and assume that no one will look through the CCTV footage, especially since it is already several months? Or should I take the initiative to approach NUS campus security to remove the CCTV footage? One problem is that it is realistically not possible to remove 100% of the CCTV footage. I don't remember all the dates and locations on campus that we did it in. Some of the locations are also awkward to describe in words, and may be covered by more than one CCTV. 

In the worst case scenario, if someone on NUS campus security looks through the footage, will anything bad happen? I assume that the answer is no: because 1) the footage will be very grainy, and girls all look alike without clothes on (I have no tattoos), so I can just deny that it is me. 2) CCTV footage has no audio, so they cant trace me from the sounds I make. 3) My current bf graduated from NUS some 10-15 years ago and is not internet-savvy, so even if some videos spread privately, it is unlikely to spread to him.

ARRGGH. Just typing this makes me so angry at myself. Am I just super unlucky or what. My ex dosent even drive a car, while my current bf drives a ferrari. If this incident really causes me to lose my current bf, I will be FURIOUS.

If you use online dating app, if you look ugly, i don think you even stand a chance of the opposite gender starting a convo with you.

In real-life, its the same. If you are ugly, no matter how much you try to look good, nobody will approach you, no matter in what occasion or which place (Be it club/social gatherings etc).

So because you are born ugly, the only choice is plastic surgery so that you even stand a chance for a gf/wife. (Let exclude things like money and purely base on looks)

I never knew the feeling of having close friends or a girlfriend and sometimes I question why I had to miss all the fun growing up. I am the only child so did not have siblings to talk to. I was very shy and quiet up till JC so I never belonged to any friend circles and was rather invisible. When I entered NUS, I overcame my shyness but I somehow tend to feel tired quickly and clam up when I spend too much time with people. As a result, people only know me superficially and tend to forget me rather quickly. All the activities that people typically do with friends, like travelling, gaming and sports, I did it all alone. Fast forward to today, I've been working for 4 years in the same company but again, my relationships at work are superficial. I am also wary of opening up too much in the workplace as colleagues are just different from normal friends and I can't share too much personal thoughts with them. On weekends, I am either too tired or have too many errands to run to join extra activities to make friends. I feel like a robot programmed to go through the motions in life and things are rather routine and I don't have much to look forward to. Don't know wat else should I do...

I have been at NUS for over a year and have noticed that I know nothing about my fellow mainland and chinese singaporeans. I know nothing about their lives, how they live, what are their beliefs, their culture, their likes and dislikes, their issues, their concerns, their convictions. When I lived in UTR except for one chinese flatmate none of them bothered to even make small talk for a whole semester. Except for the europeans, no one had a flat or a house party and the europeans generally kept to themselves. The girls dont bother either. This was even worse  when I lived in a HDB complex. None of my neighbours bothered to say hi or even smile at me when passing by. But they did have the courage to complain about noise to the local hdb officer instead of politely requesting us to keep it low. My international indian friends here also feel the same. Some of them joined curricular clubs and felt like they were out of place. As if there is something very alien about their fellow students. I think I now understand what scarlett johansson's character felt in lost in translation. For all its sterile beauty and uber efficiency, Singapore is one hell of a lonely country to be in.

843,"I’ve always been thinner than most girls and throughout my whole life, I’ve felt really self conscious about it. I eat just as much as others do & don’t try to lose weight or maintain my size but somehow I just remain slim. 

Since young, teachers and classmates asked me many times “why are you so skinny” or commented that I’m too thin and that I should eat more. In primary school, a teacher jokingly asked whether or not my mom feeds me at home. In secondary school, a classmate made a joke, pointing out that my legs looked like a pair of chopsticks. and finally in JC, my friends often joked that if the wind was too strong I might get blown away or that if I carried heavy items, my bones might just break.  These are just some of the many jokes that I’ve heard over the past years, all of which I just laughed along with them or rolled my eyes to express annoyance. 
I hate that I didn’t have the courage at those times to voice out my discomfort. 

Although I believe that those statements were made with no ill intent and that some people genuinely ask questions out of concern, it still didn’t stop my insecurity from growing over the years. 

So this post is to bring up the issue of skinny shaming and also to seek some advice because I’m quite sick of having to justify my body size 
Does anyone have tips on how to gain weight healthily?? besides eating a lot more and exercising regularly (I just run) because I’ve tried both but my weight only increased slightly and I look pretty much the same :,,) 

And lastly, I want to put it out there that skinny shaming is a real problem. It’s sad that there are people who view it as less hurtful than fat shaming or are not even aware that skinny shaming is a thing. Body shaming in any form just really sucks for the person receiving those comments and I hope that people become more conscious of the words they speak and how it can affect others. If you’re truly concerned about their health, speak to the person privately about it and in a sensitive manner. Please don’t make it into a source of laughter and entertainment for yourself and others.

We each has an assigned seat and occasionally on Monday when I reach the office I will find my stuffs meddled with (like placed differently compared to when I left them on Friday). The worst is on three occasions he left an unwashed shirt, a pair of unwashed socks and a pair of slippers at my desk! I know its him because my other collegue mentioned his socks was very unique which make me noticed them before he left them at my desk. I noticed he bought a new pair of socks afterwards.

The thought of him enjoying sitting at my desk over weekends creeps me out not to say him leaving a shirt, a pair of socks and slippers he worn before at my desk. (I throw them all into the bin and nobody asked me for any of it). 

I didn't confront him because the last time I talked to him out of friendliness, he started ""coincidentally appearing"" wherever I go, and keep finding reasons to talk to me even though we don't work on the same project. I didn't tell the HR or my boss because it feels like something not exactly too serious, lacking of obvious evidence and its a ""he say vs I say"" thing which I doubt he will ever admits to them.

I just told my boss I feels uncomfortable sitting near him, and he was asked to sit far away from me. But recently a collegue sitting near me resigned and he automatically shifted over to sit nearby me citing that the seat is nearer to the other collegue he is working the project with. Urghhhhhh...

As everyone is aware the recent ModReg failure has left many of us disappointed and wishing more could be done. As a year 1 freshman, the impact of this has been great on both an academic and personal basis. From young, my mum has always said that studies should come before chasing girls, so I studied very hard to get into JC and then into NUS. My friends recently introduced me to Tinder and I met the girl of my dreams. Pretty, tall, and sweet, I knew she was the right one for me after hearing about how her mum had cancer and her father left her. She told me that she was going to meet me, but I had to deposit $300 into her bank account first before she could take the bus down cause her family is facing financial difficulties. However, disaster stuck when the ModReg failed, not only was I stuck at home waiting for it to fix before going to meet her, I wasn't able to keep the laundry for fear that the portal would refresh and I would lose my mods. My leadership, excellence, and overcome mentality were dashed in that moment when I collected my soaked OCS singlet from the bamboo pole of my 5-story bungalow with 10 Lamborghini and 3 Ferrari; the same singlet I had sworn to wear to meet her. At that moment I swore to myself that I would never let this happen again and decided to seek help from professional sources. Every date I went to I brought flowers, whether 50$, 100$ or the occasional 1000$ bouquets I always made sure I ate cai peng to save and give these girls everything they deserve. I remember there was one time with my last 50 dollars, I sent my date home by taxi, and walked home after that. My mentor Justin – founder and CEO of GTHD group, was so impressed that he offered me an internship due to my exemplary conduct in upholding the SAF 8 core values, as an Officer of the Singapore armed forces. 

In conclusion I want to let all the guys reading this know that, with enough hardwork, perseverance, and commitment, you do not have to stay single all your life. In fact, my girlfriend just texted me to meet her tonight at orchard tower. Do your best trust in the rest. Happy Saturdays.

I personally treasure friendship a lot, and I am very interested in making and maintaining friendships. Sadly, people manage to link everything to romance. 

There are 3 guy friends in my faculty whom I’m very close to. Do you know what people accused me of? They said I’m “leading them on” and “failing to reject their advances”. We talk every day because we are close friends and is there anything wrong? So if your close friends are female and you girls chat every day , does that imply you are lesbian?

Also, people even say that a guy who already has a Girlfriend should “keep a distance” from other female friends. Why? So if he goes overseas with a girl, he must be romantically interested, but he goes overseas with a guy, he Isnt gay? 

Even worse, I am discouraged from making friendships with guys who are attached???  Hello, it’s the same thing as what I do with my best female fiends ; watching movies, texting about plans, sharing desserts? So I’m flirting when its a guy but its true friendship if it’s a girl ???

Don’t get me wrong, I have close friends who love me and me to them equally as much. But coming into uni and staying in hall, I find that i spent more time with school people than my friends from JC(of whole are my close friends) because we all go to different schools and faculty. 

I heard people say that one can only either be close to hall people or faculty people. I sometimes wonder if I can have close friends in both. And since I did not join hall camp(for various reasons) but did join my faculty camp, I naturally would be closer to my faculty friends. I know everyone will say I should be contented to have close friends. But because I spent much time in hall too, I sometimes wished I had a group to go to and someone to call a close friend. Every time I attend hall events, I am reminded of how alone I am because my peers have already bonded with each other over the course of orientation. 

I feel like an unwanted child. I know many will say that I shouldn’t self pity and this will not help my situation but I just can’t help it. I’ve always thought, what if I was prettier, smarter, more outgoing, more enthu. Will people like me then?

I know many will say that I should try to make friends initiate conversations and stuff. But every time I want to I just freeze up. I’m just not a social person. And on cases when I do, I find that I’m getting lukewarm responses and that the other party is just not really interested in what I’m saying. 

I’m sorry if this post sounds very self entitled or self pitying. I know that I should try harder but it’s so difficult for me. I know I shouldn’t be greedy or wait for people to approach me. And just to emphasize, I love my current close friends and I am very thankful for them and our friendship.

853,"I feel like I'm losing my physical attraction towards my bf.. Back in NS, he was in NDU so he had a very lean bod (super firm pecs and defined 6 pack and all) and I'd be lying if I didn't get turned on my his physique. That was probably one of the major reasons why I looked forward to our 'quality time' on bed once he booked out.

We were still quite active just after he ORD-ed (finally no need to wait until wkend!) but less active once uni started since we are both in courses with demanding workload. During this time, he lost his lean physique. I understand that he'll probably never reach back to the peak he was in NDU due to school and club commitments, but his diet of Koi and salty, fattening food isn't helping his weight either.

Almost 2 years since his ORD, he has lost that 6 pack I used to love touching so much. Now, when I do feel his bod, it's less hard and firm, more flabby and soft. We still do have sex of course, but I find myself not getting turned on as much as I used to.

What am I to do? I'm afraid of telling him directly cause I know that he's very sensitive and it might hurt him and his ego. Yet, I'm not enjoying our lovemaking sessions as much as I used to. I used to initiate sex more often last time, but now, it's always him.

Some of you here are probably gonna tell me that I'm being superficial and demanding and all. Don't get me wrong. I still love my bf. He's the sweetest and most sincere guy I know. And I'm not demanding that he gets back to his peak physique either. Just kind of saddened that he has let himself go and is getting quite a bit of flab on his bod already. I can of course keep reminding myself of all his positive points like his personality. But when it really comes down to lovemaking on the bed, I can't exactly force myself to be physically turned on, can I?

However, I can’t help but feel that the student body is totally powerless in this context, from the fact that aside from complains, there is NOTHING we can do to ACTUALLY address the problem.
There hasn’t been much pleasant comments going around with regards to the NUS platforms we are using. Shall/Can we start taking ownership over the platforms we are using?
I’m pretty sure we’d be able to find a bunch of competent software engineers from whichever faculty (probably majority from SoC), that would be willing to do it either out of passion or for the sake of improving portfolio. NUSMods is a pretty good testament to what SoC students can do.
That being said, it’s unlikely that such a simple idea hasn’t already been thought of and proposed to Registrar Office (RO). Either RO rejected it to show how inflexible they are and that they would prefer to hire a bunch of incompetent coders, or this just shows that batches after batches, NUS students who claim they are ""passionate"" to give back to the school community aren't getting their priorities right.

861,"I’ve been a long time reader of this website but first time posting here. After reading the #67088 post, I feel that it is my social responsibility to stand up and counter some of the comments made by some commenters. I recognize that what I am about to say may not be popular among readers of NUSWhispers, but it is essential that a alternative view is made known for the sake of our society.

As a alumni of NUS and having served in the military myself during National Service, I am shocked frankly speaking, by the hostility toward the suggestion of having a day to honor those who served in our military. Stereotypes claiming that “occifers are trying to use this opportunity to show off their rank” is frankly an insult to the blood, sweat and tears that many of our men and women who have served in our military, both past and present.

Our military plays a vital part to our survival today. To those keyboard warriors who trash this suggestion, I challenge them: would you dare to claim that we can have a stable and prosperous Singapore today without the SAF? Would you be able to study safely in NUS without the SAF defending the sovereignty of Singapore? Therefore as an extension, it is important to uphold and defend national service so that we can have a strong and functioning military.

It is very disappointing to see that years of national education from primary to secondary school has apparently failed to educate these people on how vulnerable we are as a nation. Especially those males who have already went through national service, yet fail to see the importance of upholding such an important institution.

What OP has suggested, if I understand correctly, is a very commendable suggestion. Since SAF day falls on a day during the university vacations, it is a very good suggestion to come up with an alternative day during semester time to commemorate our SAF. So that more students can experience it themselves and understand the importance of our military better. 

After seeing so many negative comments to OP’s post, I strongly believe that it is even more important to implement such suggestion. Only by education through initiatives like this, can we reduce ignorance among Singaporeans. This message needs to be enforced, because people tend to forget what they learnt in national education in their early years. Only by constantly repeating the message, can the message sink in. 

I therefore strongly urge NUSSU to strongly consider this suggestion of having a day to commemorate the SAF during school day, and to especially educate those who may have become ignorant its importance in ensuring Singapore’s success.

However, my parents feel that I should not have skipped my own convocation (if not the whole world would not know that I am a university graduate). Initially, I felt that if my own graduation ceremony is supposed to be a happy event, I should not feel obligated to entertain others (as I hate socialising). However, after seeing all the graduation photos on Instagram, I'm starting to feel a slight tinge of regret (like 0.1%). 

I'm not asking for advice, just want to know if there are people who share similar thoughts as me. For me personally, apart from that 0.1% of regret, I feel that there is nothing wrong with not attending your own convocation.

So while his relationship algorithm is pretty cool, asking him how to get a bf/gf is not that helpful unless you pm him to matchmake you or something.

We'd met one day at some elective lecture - he ended up not taking the module since there were clashes with his other subjects, but we saw each other around utown quite often, and we'd head over to my room quite regularly too.

I thought nothing of it since to me it was just an exchange fling, something to keep my sex drive at bay. I guess I got the lucky end of the stick since he didn't fit the stereotype of the typical Chinese guy, definitely larger than average and way larger than I expected. Not to mention that he knew how to use it too.

So now my current boyfriend is flipping out about this since apparently to him he's been ""cucked by some asian chinese boy"", though I really don't get it, we weren't even together at that point.

Just wondering if any of the exchangers here from the US have a similar issue with this? Not sure where this is coming from, I know xenophobia when I see it but this is just confusing to me.

He finds issues with all sorts of things he finds out, turns out he's friends with some other dude who knows my hookup, and he's just talking about how he's small (I'm about 160cm, quite short, but the guy I hooked up with is only about 165), how as an engineering student he should spend more of his time studying, snide comments on why he's good at biology since he's bioengineering... and all sorts of other crap.

I personally don't stand for this crap and I've put us on hold till he sorts himself out; I don't see how or why I should listen to my boyfriend talk so much crap when he's the one smaller where it counts, honestly, and he's not some hot shit that I can't live without.

So to the point, I'm just reaching out here to see if anyone else has had something similar happen after coming back home from exchange? I'm just wondering if this is something that happens often, since I'm damned sure I can't find anyone else to ask here at home.

As I hear my uni mates telling me the same thing, I was holding back my sadness and disappointment and agreed reluctantly with a smile, knowing fully well that history will repeat itself again.

Having said that, I think NUSWhispers tend to plant an exceedingly unrealistic demographic sample size of students or local u grads in general and expectations of the cs career. 

Not everyone is a Cs student. Not everyone can be good at Cs. And vice versa for other roles like sales, investments, consulting. You don't go to an arts school and expect to become Picasso. Some become legends, 99% are mediocre at best. Programming pays well but not even close to some of the other career choices and options. Inhouse programing will continue to grow but the bulk of the industries where the real resources are still outsource or purchases modular softwares to keep businesses running. FAANG represents a tech bomb or bubble (maybe ex apple amazon). Every major fund knows that (oops). The reason for this high overly inflated salaries is because of the severe lack of demand. In the near future (10-15 years) Cs is going to be basically construction workers building bricks for corporation. Except the ground is up in the clouds. Remember MySpace or bebo? Neither do I. If you're spending 12 hours a day at work doing coding work, you'll earn triple that in a consulting or banking or trading job. Where people are paid to solve real problems. This is coming from a double finance cs student who graduated abroad and pretty much offered by every big tech firm. I chose the high ivory tower life and earn from 5min calls and coffee deals. Not by spending the hours crunching meaningless binaries that the mass public don't care about.

Tldr keeping up with the latest skill sets are important. But that still dosent make u the exec or decision maker but a glorified keyboard puncher.

904,"Reading the comments on NUSWhispers reminds me of the sad state of our intellectual debate culture. It seems a number of commentators suffer from a lack of basic comprehension skills and are overly eager in using ad hominem arguments. 

Logic of some commentators seems to be as follows:
- post 1: OP questions whether it’s good practice for children to give allowance to parents as this may encourage financial imprudence and possibly result in a vicious cycle where subsequent generations are unable to support themselves at old age = OP Is unfilial, ungrateful person etc (note OP did not say he doesn’t contribute to his family) = his post must be invalid. 
 
- post 2: OP posts about self entitled mindset of some parents / old people on MRT (note OP did not even mention he was the one giving up seats / he doesn’t want to give up his seat) = OP is selfish uncouth ungracious etc = his post must be invalid.

Food for thought: Before we eagerly jump to ad hominem attacks, maybe it’s worth considering alternative Viewpoints?  I also think schools should start teaching logical analysis.
(Strangely these two posts i noticed seem to be contrary to “Confucian/ Asian” values which may explain the strong reaction of some people?)

908,"OP of #64229 here. I mentioned how hard it was to fit the computational thinking (CT) requirement into pharmacy timetables previously. For us we can take either CS1010(S) or COS2000 to fulfill our CT requirements. Now that the timetable for the coming academic year has been released, I would like to provide some additional comments.

We couldn't do that in year 1 because all the CT modules clashed with our pre-allocated core modules in both Y1S1 and Y1S2.

Now our year 2 timetable has just been released and guess what, only CS1010S fits into our timetable in Y2S1. For COS2000, it clashes with our pre-allocated core modules in Y2S1.

Then for Y2S2, BOTH CS1010S and COS2000 clashes with our core modules.

I don't know which genius designed the timetables, but does that mean we should all take CS1010S this coming semester? Or wait until year 3 and pray that it fits into our timetable? Well, I wouldn't risk delaying my graduation by choosing the latter option.

In addition, some of us in pharmacy are not that smart mathematically, and we prefer COS2000 so as to not get wrecked by the bell curve in CS1010S. But the timetable seems to be forcing us to choose CS1010S. Well done.

In summary, I really hope that we can be given clarification on when we would be able to take the CT modules. In other words, I wish that we can be informed about in which of the remaining semesters up to Y3S2 will those CT modules not clash with our pre-allocated core modules. 

It’ll be even better if the one planning the timetable for our core modules can plan with these CT modules in mind and avoid clashing our pre-allocated core modules with these CT modules. In fact, I think that this is what should’ve been done in the beginning when whoever decided to make CT module a requirement for pharmacy students. 

As it stands currently, not knowing if we are able to take these CT modules in year 3 makes planning difficult for us. We will absolutely become a laughing stock if some of us cannot finish the CT modules and graduate on time simply because our core modules keep clashing with the CT modules.

909,"Unlike some people here, I was never a officer in ns. Instead, my rank was only a spec. However, not having an officer rank never stopped me from emulating from officers and learn from their best practices. Let me share my experiences from my past 2 years of life in nus as a student. I seriously hope that through this sharing those people who always dream to be an officer but never got to be one can learn something and stop complaining about not being one.

First, I seek to have military style punctuality. Whenever there is a timing to meet, be it when going out with my friends or project work discussion, I always arrive on time down to the minute. In fact, during my project group discussion when my group mates were late by 2 minutes, I berated them for being late. They held their heads in shame. Two of them voluntarily dropped 20 pushups since they felt so guilty of delaying the start of our meeting.

Second, I make sure my room in my hostel is very tidy. Everything is properly put in its standardized location. Every morning I do cleaning until I do not have any dust on my cupboard. Let me tell you something more. I’m an RA. I also do spot checks on those under my responsibility and ensure that their living conditions are proper and well, just like in my room. They may complain about me sometimes but they all understand that I’m doing it for their good and that’s what matters. Some of them also voluntarily dropped 20 because they did not live up to what they should be.

Last but not least, I always say “last men can hear me?” whenever I’m giving a presentation. One of the most important qualities one learns as an officer in army is communication. Never assume others can understand what you are saying. The saying goes “you think I think who confirm?”. Make sure to always confirm, double confirm, triple confirm to avoid misunderstanding. That’s why I strongly pressure my every single one of group mates in my project to do ask that question during our group presentation. Although we got laughed at by our class, out tutor praised us and said that we did a good job. All of us in my group got an A for that module.

So to those who keep complaining that they weren’t an officer because they didn’t got the chance to, I say to them, shut up or go home. It’s the mindset that matters, not the rank that you hold on your shoulders.

Working with the leads who NATO can really vomit blood. Team members are a hit or miss, some are actually quite capable and willing to teach while others cmi, but people tend to come and go quickly.

If you're someone with good experience and/or from CS, there are way better companies out there and the technical tests should be ok for you. That being said, I feel it's good experience for individuals with less experience or from non CS degree wanting to attempt an IT path (dealing with insane work, bad bosses and tough clients really trains you up).

Also, seeking some advice here myself from people in the data industry. I have been trying to find better opportunities in non SI companies (non FAANG), particularly in data analyst/scientist roles. I made it to a few interviews after applying for many companies, meaning my experience and portfolio is not too bad, but so far no offers. Besides reflecting on my interviews and studying up more, any advice on how to improve in general? The scope of things they quiz in interviews/take home tests are quite wide and I do feel a bit tired both working and preparing for interviews. I'm not in CS or Stats but have an engineering degree, unfortunately one of the recruiters for a well known company openly told me that they prefer CS degrees for data roles. Another question is, is the market considered decent or bad for new data openings at the moment? Any advice to these questions is greatly appreciated!

914,"Hello everyone,

This is the first and probably the last time I am writing here. I never really believe much in this, but perhaps I am just too 'desperate' in wanting to voice it out, wanting to 'talk to someone'.

I came from a dark and abusive background. Faced a lot of betrayal and all those because of my trait and upbringing - I give a lot to others, I never take anything in return. People just take and go, no matter how hard I tried. Nobody ever stayed.

In a way, I was very lonely, extremely lonely. Problems in the family, so I tried with friendships, the people around me. Nothing works.

I ORD in 2016, thereafter I was left completely alone again. There was nothing 'next' except going to the workforce (I am working in NUS, although it is just a workplace). 

By some 'luck', I managed to get to know a group of people whom was very nice and kind to me. I was extremely happy, touched, and thankful for their gestures. Especially when the last time I had a 'group' was in 2016 with my unit.  

I said I would do my best for them. As they were a student club, I proposed a gift to help them reach their fullest potential. I talked to them and hear about their desires, and as if that is not enough, I still do external research on what I could obtain for them. I volunteer and help in their planning and preparation for their event. I liaise with the school officers to get the most for them. (And many more).

On one Saturday, they suddenly decided to stop all communication with me, ceasing off our relationship. They said that they were under instructions from the school, although checking with the school became even more confusing as I really do not know who is lying to me.

Less than two weeks later while I was still trying to find out the truth, the conditions deteriorate severely. They avoided me, I was unable to talk to anyone. Then they made a formal complain about me.

I am really helpless, back to how I was left completely all alone again. I felt so betrayed, almost as if someone out there is spreading lies and hurting me which caused the whole saga. I was extremely careful and conscious of my actions, I did nothing wrong. Nonethelesss, I never did find out the truth, and due to the formal complain, I was sentenced to 'death' without any justice or clarification whatsoever.

I am just a poor and pathetic lonely individual. Abandoned and left for dead, especially when I just took a major life blow recently, I find it impossible to continue anymore, with all the odds against me. There is really nothing I could do to defend or protect myself. 

Posting here does not help in any way. But, all I can say is ""help""

Encourage people to hitch hike at kr mrt. It can reduce the load on isb. At the same time make it more efficient to transport people as fewer vehicles are needed to cramp onto the roads in nus.

Before you laugh at my hitchhiking idea and shoot it down, let me tell you I observed this practice in another uni overseas. That uni has a large campus without internal shuttle bus. Their population is much smaller over a much larger land area. Students without cars just stick their thumbs up near the main entrance and those driving stop to pick them up as a matter of courtesy. Problem solved for them. Although the context is different here, I believe that there some ideas we can learn from them.

For the few who say 'just take it and prove your worth', what are the chances that you can get a 50% increment and hit 3k plus within a year or two?

I'm currently taking online courses and learning new skills (SQL and Python) but i doubt it will come handy given that employers always ask for practical work experience and not knowledge of it. But oh well, i'll just learn to kill time for now.

920,"In continuation of #66234 & #66361

Our relationship started off smooth and in between with fights and gradually stable. Throughout the relationship, there was a particular issue which lingered and eventually caused our split.

His parents.

He has a set of extremely difficult parents, his Father in particular.

Situations I faced: 
 1. Ex always expected me to not wear flip flops when we meet his parents for meals because he said his dad didn’t like it.

Ok fine, so as to be more presentable. 

2. No shorts because father didn’t like it. 

Ok fine. 

3. When I travelled on a beach holiday with my friends, his parents went to search for my fb profile and saw that my cover photo was a bikini one (back view and far away from camera). They kicked up a big fuss and told him to tell me to remove the pic and commented that I’m a very indecent girl. 

I was speechless because wtf? I agreed to this request anyway. 

4. 1.5 years into our relationship, my ex came to the airport to send me and my family off for our holiday and to pass me some currencies which he helped me change. (Because he lived in Pasir Ris so it’s convenient to pass me at the airport) Guess what? His family came along without informing me just because the parents wanted to meet my parents for the first time. My parents were stunned when they appeared but didn’t mention anything. Ended up having a meal at the airport together and off I left for holiday.

5. Throughout the 6 years, they like to ask for last minute meet ups when I already have many plans made. Their meetup venues include coming to my house (always emphasize to my parents that they just want to get along with my family members so that in future won’t have any issues). -.-

BY THE WAY, they are not from a rich background. 
I’ll stop at 5 because the list goes on.. 

Towards the 4th year into our rs, both my parents fell really sick, both diagnosed with conditions 3 months apart. 
Tbh I am still thankful to him for being there with me during this difficult journey but at the same time his parents took the opportunity to climb all over our heads and bullied my family members and expected my family to listen to his father’s nonsense! I believe in fengshui but his father is NOT ANY fengshui master yet he kept criticizing my house on how we arrange things at home, and took some of our stuffs to throw away because to him, they are no good. His own house is like a dump and filled with junk! My parents were sick and always gave in because they didn’t want to end things ugly. I told ex about how uncomfortable I felt but he brushed me off saying to listen to his dad instead. (Things thrown were not that expensive so forget it)

He always wanted me to listen to his father’s nonsensical requests without caring for my feelings.
His father is literally the one giving instructions to our relationship.

Fast forward -

My dad passed away one week after the breakup, and he didn’t even bother coming to pay his last respects when my dad doted on him! All he did was ignore my texts and dropped me 1 message to say he transferred me S$500 for the wake. Of course I transferred the money back and no conversations were made after. 

My family and I suffered so much because of these, and all he did was to leave me right after his father decided to tell him to do so. 
Even though he’s a heartless and cold blooded coward who had never stood up for us, I kind of pity him that he is living under such a bad environment. However given the fact that he’s also already 30 this year, I still cannot accept that he can’t even stand up for himself. 
I can’t blame him for being extremely filial.
He always lies to his parents for his own benefits but when it comes to our relationship he expects me to always listen to his family. 
Gf can choose, parents cannot choose.
As to why he’s so afraid of his dad, perhaps I’ll share this another day.

I never had to worry about portioning out a fraction of my time to spent with a certain someone because there never was a someone which is great because I highly value time by myself and time with different groups of friends(not that I have many groups of friends). But as we gradually grow up and now moving into uni, my friends around me are either attached, had been attached or potentially are going to be attached. The non attached ones are trying to find their special ones on dating websites and stuff. I guess it’s pretty normal to want to find a gf/bf at this age. 

There are at times when I thought how nice would it be to have that special someone by me. I keep saying that single life is great and I mean it even till now. But I don’t know if it is because that I am afraid and not prepared to be in a relationship. I am afraid of the changes that will happen in my life. (This might sound damn weird) I see the attached friends around me they spent time with their partner every week. For those who live on campus, they only see their family /friends in a different uni on the weekends. But yet they have to set a weekend for their partner. To me it just seems like that is a lot because I only see my family twice a week. I know it is not fair for me to make such a judgement because i have not experience being with someone I like. But it is this fear of potential changes to my lifestyle that make me afraid of getting into a relationship. Is it that I’m am just not mature enough for a relationship and my concerns are immature?

And apparently my boss is hiring more of these graduates as I’ve heard that they increased the headcount. 

I hope that I’m wrong for having this impression and I know these 2 doesn’t represent the entire cohort but I’ve seen some reviews (not exactly the same but quite similar) about graduates from ISS MTech. Apparently most of them do not have local degrees, so they try to “convert” their degree into a local degree but is Masters instead of retaking the Bachelors.

tl;dr I am friendzoned by/ is a ""spare"" for a girl. So girls, please don't give guys false hope with your actions, or worse, treat them as a ""spare"" when he genuinely likes you.  

I got to know a girl from work. She is cute, cheerful, positive and caring. She is also quite extroverted and and somehow, as an introvert myself, I felt comfortable around her. We had a chance to have dinner one day after work and we chatted for almost 3 hours, getting to know each other better. She didn't mention anything about her bf at that point and I was hoping to go after her if she wasn't attached. We got closer due to our common interests only for me to find out a few weeks later that she is attached. While I was disappointed, I was totally fine with that as I respect their relationship and didn't want to be a third party so on my part I tried to keep a distance from her. 

Despite that, she continued to take the initiative to get closer to me and we even went out on together multiple times (cycling, weekend lunch etc., all planned or hinted by her). We texted each other often and from the texts it really felt like we were an item, talking about anything and everything. Some of our interactions were quite intimate as well(feeding each other food, her pulling my ear, her showering me daily with plenty of care and concern with me reciprocating etc.). She understood me better than myself and I think I know her quite well too. Of course I am aware that she is attached and I didn't felt like it was appropriate to do things that cross the ""imaginary line"". She is also quite open to her bf about us going out together this way and the bf didn't seem to mind. She also tells me about what she does with her bf at times too. 

This continued for months until she broke up with her (now ex)bf one day. The reason for breaking up was unrelated to me. I did my best to get her out of her post-break up stage and did confess my feelings to her one day after she was better. She said she had never considered me before and would start doing so. 

Fast forward a few weeks later, she rejected me for someone she got to know online for less than a month and only met twice. I was sad and frustrated not only at the rejection in favour of a near total stranger she knew for less than a month without giving me a proper chance, but also at her reason for rejection as she said we have very different interests and personalities. I am sure all couples have their similarities and differences and I would say the both of us have a good balance of both similarities and differences. Anyway, after the rejection, we agreed to remain as friends, which i agreed and hoped to move on.

Naturally, she strayed further from me initially but recently, probably because her honeymoon period is over with her new bf, she started doing things like making me breakfast, giving me encouragement when i have problems and even buying things for me that she knew I would want(I returned her the money later), just to name a few. I tried to be colder towards her but that didn't seem to work on her. It also didn't felt right to me to give her a cold treatment for all her warm actions. She also didn't seem to mind doing all these to me in front of others who knows that she is attached. 

Yes, I have considered the fact that I am a ""spare"" to her, ever  since before she broke up with her ex. My feelings and her actions, as well as the break up gave me some hope and got the better of me. But isn't she putting too much effort into maintaining a ""spare""?

We used to be so close together and sharing almost everything.. perhaps except some feelings deep down that started to be hidden. But i’m so confused now with all the work out together posts and seeing how others get all her attention, but only more and more secrets get piled up between us.. she asked me whether I’m still jealous. How can I not be jealous when i'm treated like a spy but so many others in her life can have it easy and still be a part of her life? But where were all of them when she needed help?

Everyday i wake up in fear that idk today will be a day we grow closer or more distant. I don’t even know the closer we grow is a mirage or we really are closer. I don’t even know her feelings to me are borne out of guilt just because of how nicely I treated her or cause she pity me.

I’m guessing she’s probably confused too and i really want to give her time. But you see, I can only guess, but how can one not have doubts when he lives each day with her with only guesses? Sigh.

TLDR: I want to workout with her too :(

942,"My boyfriend (probably) doesn't read NUSWhispers, so here goes.

From a few months ago, our bedroom life started to change. I think he caught hold of it or figured it out during our conversations. So basically, almost every time we do it, halfway through the act, he slips into this ""mode"" where he roleplays a serial killer, kidnapper, rapist, just basically twisted psycho. I think he knows that I like it, but I don't say anything about it, it's this mutual thing where we just play it out. Sometimes he gets a little violent and says stuff like ""I'll kill you, you bitch!""

To be clear, I don't hate that he does that. It's strange, but I think I actually like feeling scared. I know it might be wiser to talk to him about it directly instead of asking a few random strangers who I most likely don't even know, but I don't want to risk spoiling this little thing we have going on. What if he starts showing restraint or even feels bad for doing all that? Ok, I guess at this point I'm just asking for reassurance that this is an acceptable situation for a couple.

944,"I’m a male student who just came out of ns and will be starting uni this year (not in nus). A few of my friends and I still struggle to adapt bac to civilian life, so we decided to form a self interest group to help us transition back. We nickname this group “platoon 1” of alpha company. Currently there are 16 of us. We just met last Monday in one of the local unis for our first outfield. Conducted in the field in school of course, so that we can get familiar with the environment. Spent five days in the open. For mealtimes, we march on the roads to the canteen, in the face of traffic honking at us. Tekan sessions happen randomly, as decided by out PC who used to be an officer in the army. Worst one happened on Friday where everyone had to walk in push up position on the hot roads during lunchtime to the canteen.

We are looking for volunteers to sign up to this. Hoping to expand to platoon 2. Anyone interested can comment below and our PC will contact you on the admin details. Only requirement is that you still have your number 4 uniform with you. Students from any university are welcome

Going forward, we look forward to extending this to semester time. One consideration is to form our own project groups, run with a military style culture. From meeting times punctuality, to content discussed, it will have a strong disciplinary style culture. For e.g. anyone late for even 10 seconds for group meetings will have to do 10 push-ups.

Another consideration that we have is coming up with our design your own module, we are looking into coming up with one module which is “integrating military style culture into civilian life”.  Stay tuned for more to come, so please comment below if you’re interested.

I find that singaporeans in the professional world (when talking to people who seems new) are condescending as fudge.

I was representing my company at an international B2B event, forgot to wear my lanyard and went about the whole venue as such to look for potential partners.

Foreigners, be it CEO, Pres, or even Associates, speak and open with respect and listen.

Singaporeans, (well, even if their business is solid), they way they speak to you is like heaven and hell before and after they see your name card.

Seeing you're young, they made fun of your capabilities and profession. Until you hand them something that shows results bigger than what they could ever achieve. Then you see a late 40 man's face change into embarassment. I'm mid 20's for the record.

The deal is off at that moment they opened their mouth.

Why liddat? Ego too big ah? So big then don't carry out lah, bring out for what? People approach you with respect but you just have to play punk.

It doesn't help that you guys have accomplished so much and that in this circle I am the least accomplished.

The last I checked, the average starting pay for Poly grads is also 2.4k (based on the GES)...

I don't understand why local guys look down on foreign girls. Is it because we don't have any family here? Or because you assumed that we couldn't find job in our homeland? Or is it just simply xenophobia?

Some foreign girls came here under scholarship, meaning they are smarter than average people. Some have rich parents who just want to send their children to study overseas. Maybe some of them have strong accent or don't speak very good English, but why looking down on them?

When i was young (6 or 7 years old) , i was a happy lively naive girl and had little clue about sexual and whats wrong. I had an elder brother which was 4 years older than me. We used to hang out alot playing PlayStation in the wee hours at his room. 

As time progressed, things got very wrong. I was often asked to strip or pull down my pants or touch his private area and i have no clue that this is wrong and i thot all brothers and sister plays like this. So i often hang around with my girl cousins and would request them to play the same game that my brother has played with me. 

As times goes by, i grew up and realised that i have been molested. I stoped talking to my brother and things got so ugly between us. My mother and father always fault me for creating this disharmony amongst family members (they dont know) . We dont eat reunion dinner tgt and we dont talk to one another. 

Since then, 20 years has passed and though i have moved on (still not talking) , there will forever be a scar in my heart that i have been molested by my brother and that i have done the same thing to others.

In fact, they're nonchalant about it and wanted to bail out of the ceremony. I didn't attend my Bachelor's because they didn't felt that there's a need to attend again since they've been to my elder sibling's ceremony before that (also from NUS). So anyway, they unwillingly went and forced me to leave the ceremony before it ended because the ceremony was boring (I made the mistake of leaving everything on their car). My elder sibling even posted on IG story that it was boring and a waste of time. I went on stage to get my scroll without a single person supporting nor feeling proud of me because my family all left the hall before that. I also didn't do anything like ""taking photos with friends"" because I have none. I feel horrible now for attending the ceremony and wasting the tickets, which somebody else's proud family and friends could have used instead.

How is it that I have no support from my family nor a single friend? I've wasted my life and probably don't deserve to live too.

Have been with my boyfriend for 1 year (also moved in with him).
Realized that communication issue getting worse and him getting lazier. E.g Certain issues like planning for a trip has all fell on me (thou I initiated to plan most of it, just need him to know and have a final discussion before booking any thing)
If we touched certain topics that require him to think or make decisions together he will shut off or postpone it... We have been holding off discussions and now if we need to have any decision, means I will be the one to plan ... It makes me so tired and unappreciated because he simply shuts off.

Also the more he avoid, the more persistent I get which results in a few arguments. 

Even in terms of intimacy he always reject me for months saying he is tired.... he seems uninterested in everything except food.

On the other hand, he shows acts of service thru small little gestures eg cover blanket for me at night, refilling my water bottle before I go work, tabao food for me etc.. 

What can I do? When I force an answer he say he is stress at work/money... Is there anything I can do? Is the relationship worth saving? Or am I over demanding...

969,"I've a girl in my course that I'm interested in, she's only about a year younger than me since she took a gap year to work for some industry exposure. I find her really cute and friendly and definitely just my type. So our fac is pretty small, and we're all pretty much looking at the same firms when we graduate anyway. Since techno closed down we've pretty much needed to go next door to engineering to have lunch and so along the way we strike up some good conversation and I definitely can see this going somewhere.

So problem is I've recently found out that a couple years back she hooked up and slept with a friend of mine a few times, I guess in the first semester of uni, since this friend of mine got attached the semester after that. It's not really the problem that he's in engineering and we run the risk of meeting or running into him, but I just can't get over the fact that she's slept with him.

I've narrowed down a couple of possibilities, since I guess I was really trying to work past this uneasy feeling; I really do like my friend and I get the vibe that she's open to us going further.

First one is just because I've heard from her directly that this friend of mine slept with her senior's(?) girlfriend when her senior was still dating her, and I guess it kinda seems like he's not a nice person? I mean he's my friend and all and we're pretty close, and this really sounds like something he'd do, in the past at least, I'm just rather uncomfortable with the thought that she was willing to bang someone like him? I mean, she wasn't even really good friends with him at the time, they just met up on tinder and after a couple of months of going out on and off she just decided to invite him over? I mean it's kinda obvious what he wants right? Not sure if this is it since I've kinda been okay with my friend's dating habits since a few years back, and he was pretty much commitment issues guy, he'd get close to some girl and get some action, and then suddenly as things got serious he'd get out. Not a problem to me tbh, just slightly unsettling to now be attracted to someone who's been with him.

So the other thing is my friend's really quite the experienced guy, I know a couple of (other) girls he's been with (obviously didn't ask my friend how he was) and though they might have a few things against him they do end up saying that he's really good in bed, and that he's bigger than average ( if you catch my drift ). So they were all pretty surprised since he wasn't a large guy, just your average Chinese dude, and at the time he did have quite the nice body, abs and defined muscles and all that. So I've not had much experience personally, but to be fair not everyone gets the opportunities my friend gets... and I guess since he's the only guy she's ever been with she might be expecting a bit more from me than I can give? Just worried I won't match up to her expectations...

As for my friend, I guess it seems like he's changed since then, and gotten attached pretty long term? I've got no hard feelings against the guy, and I think he's changed for the better personally. It's not so much that I don't like the idea of my female friend having been with him ( I mean I reaaaalllyy don't like it, like who would, man? ) more than not liking that she banged him when he was still a major commitment-phobe? I guess?

Something like I don't mind so much that she's banged my friend ( who's since changed ) but really mind that she banged him when he was still *that guy*.

And also I'm really worried that I won't be able to perform in the bedroom; I've done my required readings in this area, but really nothing comes close to actual practice and I don't have much of that... ( to be really honest nobody's said anything good about my skills there ) and I guess if you guys say I can always improve it's literally inevitable that I'll always be compared to him? Like she'll always hold him as the standard I'll need to meet and I don't like that. It's not a good first time if she's busy comparing me to him in a bad way...

Really need some advice here, I'm just a really really confused dude, and I'm damn sure I'll have to find some way to deal with this before sem starts because I just can't stop thinking about this....

973,"Dear NUSWhispers admin, I hope you could publish this anonymous rant of mine as I'm really at my wits end.

I'm a Computing alumnus and got married 2 years ago. We welcomed our first child in late April 2019 and although it's a great news for us, my wife and I been having a lot of arguments since. I'm currently working from home as a remote developer for a European company earning 4,000 euros (about 6000 sgd) a month while my wife works as a HR associate earning about $3,500 a month. We have been arguing about how to take care of the child after she go back to work in September. As an engineer, I lay out several solutions for her -

1. We hire a maid to take care of the child. Her reply: Too dangerous, maid might ill-treat her. Also, our HDB (4-room) too small for maid to stay in.
2. We get my parents to take care of the child. Her reply: The child will not grow up to know who's the parents. Furthermore, my parents stay in Bukit Batok while we stay in Punggol.
3. We get her parents to take care of the child. Her reply: Her parents still working, can't do it.
4. Either one of us quit our job and take care of the child full time. Her reply: If I quit my job, who's going to support our family? It will be selfish to ask her to quit her job.

She insist that since I work from home and have freedom to choose my working hours, I should be the one to take care of her. However, I disagree because even though I work from home, I still have to work the 8 hours that I was paid for. Another rant that I have is that she always use my salary to buy make-up, nice clothes for her to wear to work. Yes her male colleagues are going to enjoy how pretty she look every morning while I have to bear her sulking face at the end of each day, all paid for by my salary. Meanwhile, she give 50% of her salary to her parents while the rest goes to her daily commute and lunch.

She keep saying I'm selfish and an MCP for asking her to quit but fact is I will happily quit my job to take care of the baby at home (something which she conveniently disagree with). Is this the trend with many Singaporean couples? Do modern wives expect their husband to earn a living and still take care of the matters at home just because we can ""work from home""? I hope by posting this, more people who work from home can come out and teach me how you deal with this issue? When it's 1 vs 1, it's really hard to tell who's wrong anymore.

There were periods when she stayed out late (for work she claim and at times to wind down) and I don’t question her. I fully trust and respect her.
It took some time (probably 15months?) but we slowly and eventually grew into our parental roles and things became back to normal.

Recently met a foreigner who studied in SIM's bachelor degree in computer science. It took him 2 years to complete his degree, and he proceed to do masters in Computer Science and Engineering in NTU. Thats a total of 3 years for both Bachelors and Masters. Makes me sad to be in NUS Computing in my 3rd year :(

Hi, I too am a man in the army, and an ASA at that. Just saying that I'm an ASA would yield some ""oh, how come ah?"" with rather condescending tones. My reason was mental health. I struggle with depression and anxiety, and it was only diagnosed after I entered NS and finished BMT. After people hear this, they would very casually ask ""u geng ah?"" and after awhile, that kinda hurt. NS can and has aggravated my previous episodes of low mood and anxious behaviour, and I honestly don't even know what exactly caused it. So please, including you and I, everybody has issues that they maybe dont air out in public. Your BMT buddy may be crying himself to sleep and youre unaware. Lets try to be nice and not mock mental disorders! Man or Commander, we all take 2 years out of our lives to contribute to the defence of sg.

The photography company printed out the photos and we can only purchase the photo from them (makes me wonder what would they do with the photos that aren't purchased). My mum was probably comparing it to Edusave award presentations where you can collect a free photo after the ceremony. What about the less well-to-do families who can't purchase anything? Does that mean that they can't own any official graduation photos at all?

980,"I was invited to be a bridesmaid from a really good friend of 17 years, along with other 4 ladies of the clique. I was really very excited about it but a series of events have made me quite disappointed.

She told my boyfriend that he would be invited and he must come and all, but end up all the seats on our table were reserved for other mutual friends, so he ended up uninvited.

Fast forward to nearing the wedding, some of these mutual friends ended up couldn't make it so these seats were ""open"" to us again, which she then invited my bf again, but obviously my bf can't go already because it's kinda last minute.

Nevermind, then we overheard that on the actual wedding day if there are extra guests coming, the bridesmaids and groomsmen are supposed to give up the seats. Seriously?!

That was not all, she told us that the gatecrash angpow are to be given to her instead of the bridesmaids. The amount is 4 digits which we totally understand why it's not given to us but we had to act like its given to us in front of the bride relatives cos the groom wanted to have ""more face"". 

On the actual day, we were doing literally everything as the brothers came only at the start of the banquet, where everything has already been done. But thankfully there is no extra guests and we didnt have to give up our seats.

At the end of the wedding, the only ang pow we received was a $10 from the bride. I'm upset not because of the money but it's the way me and my friends are being treated. We are friends of 17 years and we been through alot, and she didn't seem to feel anything about it, even some of us were giving kind of a cold treatment to her.

Is it because we are too close? If it's you, what would you do? I didnt bring it up to her because it might seem that I'm calculative, but its really about the treatment, I feel like I'm really just a bride's maid.

981,"Just wanted to share my 'not-so-good' job experience with y'all.

So before the academic year ended (AY2018/19), I took up this job I found on NUS Talent Connect giving tuition to students while waiting for the new school year to start (I am currently still working there).

The description for the job stated that the tuition centre was looking for tutors to teach Eng/Math/Science etc. (the typical subjects learnt in schools) to their students from the Pri-JC and Elementary to High school levels. So I applied for the job, stating explicitly that I could teach English/GP to local students (because my other subjects CMI) and got an interview with the hiring manager. But the interviewee then told me that the students were mostly international students taking a whole different syllabus from SG kids and asked if I was fine with that. She said the founder of the centre would tell me more about it on my first day of work. So I said fine maybe I'll research and read up on their syllabus.

Then came the first day of work: the typical routine on the first day of work, explaining job information, rules and regulations, hourly pay etc. etc. I then realised that the owner of the centre and ALL the students there were of the same nationality (not going to state which country). So all the students were international kids and the job description was misleading already. Ok fine, small issue. I asked the owner more about the international school syllabus so that I could plan the lessons more appropriately since I had zero idea what was the international school syllabus like. He/she said that they had a database of materials to use for the students, so I could just use the worksheets given there. And then he/she said he/she had a meeting to attend and the student was coming so he/she rushed out of the room before I could ask anymore questions(I saw him/her go out to grab a cupcake instead).  Anyway, sounds easy enough right? Wrong.

There was zero guidance on what was to be taught for each lesson, no standard syllabus for the tutors to follow, and worst of all the database was like crap because all the worksheets there were not worksheets at all. Rather, they were just a bunch of notes on essay writing and stuff that were used for higher level students, meaning that middle-schoolers and below could not use them. 

Further, there are so many types of English that they learn, like English A and English B, or English ESL or HL or SL, which is utterly confusing to me. I had no idea what to teach the students at all, and the owner just throws you the student to handle like a piece of meat. 

I had to research and read up on everything myself, create worksheets that were suitable for the grade which the student(s) were studying in, and think about how to make lessons fun and interesting. Because apparently, if its too lame or boring, or if its too simple or too difficult, the ‘parent card’ comes into play. So at the end of each lesson the students are given a vocab quiz on 60-80 words (which is created by the owner not me, I just hand them out accordingly FYI), which they are assigned a different list every day, which is way too many words to learn in a day and just memorising them for the sake of doing it is definitely no way to expand your vocabulary. I received messages at 12.45am from the owner before, saying that one of the parents had a, I quote, ‘total meltdown’ on her/him because the parent thought the vocabulary list was too easy for her son and that ‘We need to do some serious damage control ASAP’. Imagine getting this kinds of messages way past your working hours.  Honestly, the vocabulary list is not created by me, and the parent clearly overestimates her son’s ability because her son can barely spell English words accurately, what more handle more difficult words.  

Ok, tbh teaching the kids was fun because it gives you a great sense of achievement when you see them improve and see that they really put in effort to learn the materials that you prepared for them. That was the good part about it. But the absolute worst part of this experience was pay day. Apparently, the owner pays you according to the number of hours that he/she THINKS that you have clocked in, and that your opinion does not matter, even if you had calculated a different number of hours from him/her. 

I calculated a few more hours than his/her calculation and I tried bringing up this discrepancy to him/her to see if I either one of us had calculated wrongly, but he/she kept avoiding me like I’m the plague or the Black Death, saying, I quote again, “I need to go for lunch” or “I’ll get back to you later”. Which is NEVER.

Till today, she/he has not given me a reply, and I have not received my pay for the extra hours that I have worked. I worked my ass off (unlike him/her whose idea of teaching is throwing a 10 page vocabulary worksheet to the student and getting them to finish it while he/she uses the time to reply messages and surf the net) and I think I deserve the pay, even if she/he thinks that its just a meager amount.  I’m not gonna name the place outright, but the description states that its at a ‘prime location in O_______.’

Tl;dr Horrendous job experience.

982,"[Serious post]

I’m a male who’s just finished serving his NS, and will be enrolling at NUS very soon. As a result of my experience over the past two years, I’d like to say something to all the girls starting out at NUS this year.

Very few males talk about it, but one of the hardest parts of NS is not just the physical and mental tekan, but also the fact that you lose half of your entire social circle. It’s often joked that we males lose our girlfriends when we enlist, but it’s okay because we can just steal our juniors’ girlfriends two years later [when our juniors enlist and we start out at university]. But what many don’t realise is that this situation applies to platonic, normal female friends as well. We don’t just lose girlfriends, but all of our normal female friends as well.

One of the saddest things I’ve had to confront over the past two years as a commander and semi counsellor for my unit is seeing many of my men struggle with loneliness, especially as they see their female friends move on with their lives in university, while they’re stuck in NS. Many of them do try to find other things to occupy themselves with — learning to drive, learning a new language, getting fit etc. But many have still told me it’s hard, especially for those who were really close to female friends in poly or JC [platonic friendships between males and females do exist guys]. The issue is that many of these female friends are caught up in the new things they find in university [and that is really perfectly justified], and as a result just kind of forget about these old male friends.

I was fortunate in that those females whom I was close to pre-NS still made an effort to keep the friendship alive. But I also know many of my men who had female friends that just didn’t care about them anymore. Their male friends would often ask them how they were doing, because they could empathise with how hard NS is, but their female friends would just be off partying and having fun with their newfound hall or cca or faculty friends, and not even bother to catch up. Or they would say that it’s time to move on.

I’m writing this not to be accusatory towards females, or to make all of you feel bad. I just thought it might be important to bring this up, so that those females entering NUS now could reflect a bit on how they want their friendships to change. Feel free to disagree because I admit I have only seen one side of the story [the side told by my male men]. But from my experience, I feel it might be important for females to possibly place themselves in the feet of their male friends and empathise a bit. Of course, if there are male friends who are assholes, then really just leave them behind. But if there are male friends who you know who you think were good friends to you in the past, try to check up on them a bit and take the effort to meet them once in a while, so they don’t feel forgotten. You have no idea how hurtful it can be for males in NS to suddenly feel like they don’t matter anymore to their friends. And you have no idea how much a little conversation once a month can help.

Sorry if this goes into mansplaining territory. I just wanted to put it out there because I think this is a uniquely male experience that many of the females may not have thought of because they find it hard to empathise with. I’m not sure if many people share the same experience, but for those who do, I want you to know that you’re not alone. The two years will pass, things will get better, and eventually you’ll see that the females friends who just forgot about you aren’t really friends worth keeping.

988,"Hi. I graduated with a 3.4+ GPA from one of the local institute. I am keen on pursuing either a business/computer science degree, but I was put off by the latest IGP. 

Background

I have done before programming back when I was still pursuing my diploma. For my final year project, I have completed a mobile application, and even received an A for it. Not only that, I have also participated in competition, and even went for various industrial conferences.

As for my business modules, generally speaking, I managed to attain either a B+/A; except for 1/2 module. I managed to apply whatever I have learnt during my internship too and even gotten an A for it.


What are the odds of me getting into NUS since I am just an average student. I seriously doubt NUS will even bother to look at my university application given my mediocre GPA. 

I heard from a close friend of mine. She said that some A level students who did badly for their A managed to get into a business course. 

Is it true that A level students have preferential placement when it comes to a university placement?

For example
Student A - Average A level results
Student B - Average diploma GPA

Will the university even give student B a chance, or they will just go with student A? If so, wouldn't it be very unfair for diploma holders? After all, we have more industrial and working experience than an A level student.

May I just ask why do some mods like CS3216 have a separate application and merit list to get enrolled into? All of us worked hard enough to get a seat into SoC and now we have to compete with the cohort again to get the modules we want? It was already bad enough with having to literally go bankrupt to bid for modules in CORS before, and now we have to apply and secure place to read modules we are interested in? I understand CS3216 is an optional alternative to a compulsory requirement, but come on, the way it is advertised like it helps people to get into FAANG makes people feel bad enough to miss out. The same goes for the recent technical interview prepardness coaching email that was sent by the office. This too is openly descriminating people by their CAPs and capablities in saying that they will only coach those poeple that have a chance at getting into these big shot companies? Again, I understand that this is a non-academic course and that materials are provided to everyone but come on it is so unfair to advertise to everyone about an opportunity you will not let everyone have. Once we have enrolled into a university, please treat everyone as same now. There is already enough upper class honours etc descrimination. Really not sure if other unis do it but I would really like to point out that this is highly unfair and discouraging. I understand limited seats etc, but pls find a better criteria to pick people from. Honestly, bidding seems fair now.

That is what everyone tell me when i tell people that i am ugly, no girls has ever even showed that they had that 0.1% of interest in me.

I grew up being bullied. 

In pri school, i went to the A-classes every year. At P5, there was a bunch of classmate gathered and every single day make fun of me as i have some anxiety problem and kept going to the toilet. Got called names etc etc. But the problem got solved eventually and they stopped for some reason.

In sec school, results started to go downhill. Sec 1 and 2 were assigned by default. Went to the lousiest express class in Sec 3&4. Got bullied again cuz i was always by myself , quiet and don't interact with them. But in the end, they got ok as i m good at certain subjects and beat those other 'better' classes people during combine classes.

Poly, stick with a group. They didn't liked me as they called me a nerd. One incident: They forced me to buy a class Tee, didn't want and they still made one for me. I didn't wanna pay cuz I was having some financial problems at home. After a certain lesson, I was told by a coursemate that they were outside the room waiting to collect $ from me. I had no choice but to pay up and got laughed at by them. Totally ditched Year 3 FYP and luckily manage to passed with crap GPA.

Army, same thing again. I was always alone and became the target of everyone during BMT. I managed to survived it and my posting was ok. But 0 friends made...

Now i m a working adult, my first job, i only made 1-2 'friends' amongst colleague as i do not trust anyone after 20 mths there. 
Second job currently, i was told by other colleagues from other department that i am too serious at work and dont talk/smile. All i wanted was to complete my work on time, get my pay and go home. Everyone in my current co. Are attached/married, the single ones are not my cup of tea.

I liked this girl many years ago, competed against another guy and that guy backed off eventually and i 'won' the battle. When i confessed, she didnt gave any reply and we drifted away, lost the war.

From then, i didnt try to get into another relationship. Its probably gonna end the same way again anyway cuz i am ugly. When i walked on the streets, i looked in the air. Despite there are some good looking girls walking towards me, i will nv stare at them or into their eyes becuz what's the point?

Tried dating app, met up with a girl, had a meal, no more development, probably due to the same core problem, Looks Problem. I have confidence in my knowledge but not my looks. I feel awkward/embarrassed trying to dress up as i fear the laughers of others and also my family/relatives.

TLDR of #64933: I fell in love with one of my best friends, who is happily attached. Our personalities, interests and even food preferences matched like lock and key, we never ran out of things to talk about, and I feel she totally understands me. Because of this, I wanted to draw the line, and maintain the friendship, but failed and ended up crossing the line multiple times.

Recently, I found out from one of our mutual friends that she broke up. From this friend's account, she was very affected by the ghosting, and got into a fight with her boyfriend because of this. Apparently, she developed feelings for me too.

When I heard about this, I was mildy delighted (cmon, we are all selfish people). At the same time, I was consumed with guilt. Firstly for being the 3rd party in a relationship. Secondly for cutting her out so abruptly and causing her stress. Previously, the right choice was obvious. Now that the situation has changed, I really don't know what to do anymore.

As long as I choose literally any other route (than doing FYP), it wouldn't matter whether my cap is 4.8 or 4.2, my degree classification would be the same.

Why is the CS department intentionally dissuading its students from doing their best? Just because I have different aspirations, it wouldn't matter how well I do I still won't get FCH? I even heard from my friends who graduated from poly that they're exempted half of the industrial experience requirement, so they'd have to extend their ""normal"" candidature to get FCH (since FYP spans two semesters).

Don't even try that bullshit about how ""If you're good enough, degree class doesn't matter"" or ""You're in CS, second upper good enough already"". It does NOT excuse unnecessary structural limitations. And for what? Aren't we already 'filtered' into our corresponding degree classes thanks to the bell curve? Now you add an additional criteria that (1) explicitly removes the academic motivation of your top students with different aspirations; (2) specifically disincentivises your top students from exploring alternative career pathways (e.g. NOC); (3) is extremely prejudiced towards polytechnic graduates. 

With no clear benefit or purpose. Seriously.

Its not selfish for you to want me to be alive, even if I'm miserable and stuck in this goddamn awful life. It's only selfish for me to stop breathing because you need me alive. 

P.S. Don't ask me to seek help or talk to someone. Tried it and it didn't work. People only want to help you because it makes them feel good about themselves / it's their job to do so. The meds just leads to addiction and weight gain.

1011,"Amidst all the recent controversies about PMD riders published in the news, let me offer some perspectives, as a PMD rider myself.

Firstly, in case most of u are unaware, pavements or walkways were never exclusive to just walking pedestrians. It's meant to be shared among all users, be it cyclists, walkers, joggers or PMD riders. With this knowledge in mind, you should thus realize that the onus is on you to look out for us as well.

I disagree that it's entirely the fault of riders when accidents happen because pedestrians do not check their backs when walking, neither do they bother to avoid any PMD riders that comes colliding into their paths. The majority fails to understand that non-riders should take up the responsibility as well in order to co-exist with riders. After all, doesn't it take two hands to clap?

Teach the young ones to look out for traffic, not only on the road, but when they're walking along pavements or when they are playing in the park or playground as well. Do not listen to music when walking or jogging in public places and turn your head to check your surroundings and blindspots periodically. Also, try to avoid park connectors as that is where most of us will ride. 

Honestly speaking, I think it is ridiculous to expect us to constantly remember to sound out warnings when we're riding past anyone. We are humans too and we might forget to do so due to the daily stress in our lives that might occupy our mind, be it from work or studies.

Finally, some of u lamented about our speed. If we were to ride at walking speed, then what's the point of having PMDs in the first place if we want to achieve a carlite future where we can still maintain the convenience that comes with the speed of motor vehicles?

Do not forget that most of u make use of food delivery services which makes use extensively of PMD riders. If speed is being compromised, how will u get your orders on time?

Seriously, to those ppl who condemn PMD riders, your perverted sense of entitlement disgusts me.

1013,"Hi. I withdrew from NUS recently, after a year here and I'm headed to the UK for a course that I really like (another Bachelor's). The opportunity popped up so I think I'm gonna take it. 

I have depression too. I don't know if it's getting worse or better - you have good days, or a week, then you have bad days, weeks, maybe a month. Pills don't work. Writing about it doesn't help. Going to try talking.

It feels like there's lead in my fingers as I type this. It feels almost forbidden to propose what I want to say after the time and money invested into this by the people around me.

I'm stuck thinking whether I'll shame or embarrass my family by even proposing this. Should I try to defer or cancel my upcoming course to try and instead acknowledge my depression? Or should I continue on, striving and persevering?

I'm sorry you had to read this. You probably didn't come on here to read about a depressed guy. It feels... bad or wrong to say this. I think about killing myself a lot more as the date comes closer. It feels appropriate? I don't know, don't let me trigger you on the way out.

But one day I wake up and look at myself in the mirror and begin to fall into this deep pit of hating everything about myself and the way I look. Teeth, skin, eyes, everything. Life is unfair in many other ways and I regret that it has to be unfair fo rme in THIS way. Anything else but this hell.

I've been getting so desperate about finding a mate, a life partner. Someone I can really live with, whoever she is. 

People say, just get rich lor, the girls will flock. But that's dumb. I want to be wanted for who I am, not what I have. I would rather suffer alone than suffer being a cuckold, wanted for only what I have not who I am.

People say, just lower your standards lor. I wish it were that easy. Do you think I haven't tried?! Desperately?! Just as LGBT people can't really force themselves to become straight, it's not like us ugly people can force ourselves to like other ugly people. It doesn't work like that. I WISH it were that easy but it is not. You don't like looking at ugly people? Neither do we. We don't like it anymore than you do.

So, what to do? Lonely for life lor. Watch friends get hookups and attached to attractive partners while I languish and fall behind alone lor.

Thoughts of an ""incel"". Media loves to hate us these days. But frankly, most of us are just normal people without the good fortune of good looks. I don't feel ""entitled"" to anyone liking me or having sex with me.

I just regret it wasn't that way. And I'd give up anything to change it. Wealth, whatever. Doesn't matter when there's no one to spend it with.

I kept my interaction with her to a minimum and luckily my girlfriend thought I was just being my typical antisocial self.

I used to be close to this friend. He was a really good friend to me, always there for me and we always meet up because we stay so near each other. Most of the time we always meet up for dinner when we go home together and every other day we are always messaging one another.

But the thing about us is that we are from different leagues. He is the head of the council and in charge of everything and everyone, while I'm just at the bottom of the ranks where people just ignore and forget. 

He got promoted and I was genuinely happy for him. Soon enough, because of his promotion, he got more friends. Everyone was his friend. Everyone but me.

Our usual texts started dying out. We no longer see each other anymore and when we do, he no longer tries or make any effort to continue conversations or interact with me at all. It's like he became a stranger to me. It feels like he seems ashamed of our friendship.

Because we are guys, we don't usually confront each other on emotional and sensitive stuff like this. But it is killing me on the inside knowing that we drifted so far apart when we used to be so close.

I don't have many friends and for those that I consider close, they are really special to me. It hurts me everyday knowing that he is excelling with his life while I'm trying so hard to heal my heart from all the good times and memories we spent together.

I don't know what I did wrong. I just wish I could turn back time to when we were still close. When I was happy.

1022,"I used to think that dateless Singaporean men were just sore losers for criticizing Singaporean women. But after using Tinder, I'm beginning to realize there might be some truth to them. First of all, it is near impossible to meet single females if all your friends are married. This is just the way Singapore works.
What I discovered on Tinder was that Singaporean women are either not able to hold conversations, or have a very huge ego. If it is not a huge ego, it is a very fragile one. I thought if I matched with women who were from NUS, they might be more capable of holding conversations. I graduated from NUS, so I know what girls are like, right? Turns out, even the NUS graduates cannot hold conversations. Simple things like,""which movie do you like and why?"" A simple answer would do like,""I like Dog of Isles, it is a love letter to Japanese culture.""
I give such an answer, and local women struggle to reply me. I feel like my conversations with them must be like,""oh i had dinner with my friends on Saturday, and lunch with my parent on Sunday. Then we watch movie in the night."" If i ask Singaporean women what they think about other women, they say, ""I don't know, I don't know. I don't want to judge."" I ask Chinese, Malaysian or Vietnamese women the same question, they can tell me a lot. ""We come from a village, so we learn to be independent.""
I suspect that this may not be an education level issue. It could be a nation-wide issue. Somehow our local work culture destroys the citizens' social skills. You might say I must be ugly, and so no one wants to chat with me. But I have been chatting with women from other countries, most of them are prettier than the local women I talk to. Some of them come from business families, with thriving businesses in countries much bigger than Singapore. They are not economically weak women looking for a man to support them. None of them has scammed me or asked me to send them money. It could be that the standard of what is handsome here is different from the rest of Asia.
Those who want to comment, I'd ask you to think about what is wrong with our society. Is narcissism a growing issue? Does our work environment kill our social skills?
Please do not spew hate on any gender or sexuality. Someone give me an objective opinion.

My younger sister recently got together with her ex after 3 months of break up. And this guy is simply ridiculous!! Ever since his allowance got cut, he started living on my sister’s, buying branded goods and flaunt it on his insta, treating his friends to drinks almost every fri, dining at fancy restaurants, driving my sister’s car etc and her credit card bills is outrageously higher than before. Like seriously, i can’t help to think but his just after her money by the way he portrays himself. However, she seems like she forgot how she’d got over the heartbreak and come crying to me after finding out about his doings the last time. 

After my brother and i realized they got back together, he had been warning her about how this rs would end since he had mutual friends with that particular guy but she just doesn’t listen. When we first spoke to her about her rs, she mentioned that he’d apologized and turn over a new leaf. The more we try to get her back on track, she gets even more frustrated and locks herself in the bedroom. I guess this is what happens when one always gets things done her way. My parents told my brother and I to keep an eye on her as they are constantly travelling overseas for work. But in this situation, I really don't know how to bring her to her senses. Is she stupid or stupid?? She’s like blinded by love oh god! I can totally foresee her bawling her eyes out once again after he got enough good out of her.

For the longest time, all I've ever cared about is what other people thought. I always made my decisions based on conventional notions of ""prestige"" and ""success"", because all I've ever craved was acknowledgment and respect. I thought that was the solution to happiness.

It honestly was for a period of time. But now, it's not. 

I'm in a course with a pretty high starting pay. I got average grades after nearly driving myself insane from studying, and was fortunate enough to land a brief internship, but the fact of the matter is, I absolutely despise what I'm doing. It doesn't interest me the way it interests my friends, and I am almost certain I want nothing to do with my course the moment I graduate. And the more time I spend here, the more drained and fatalistic I become. 

Don't get me wrong. I understand that I should be grateful for the opportunities I've been given. I understand that I ""should be happy"" and that my ""stars (appear to) align"". But there's a clear demarcation between society and the individual, and what ""is"" and what ""should be"". I'm sick and tired of living someone else's dream, instead of figuring out my own.

I just want to be decently happy, I guess. And staying here just ain't gonna cut it. No matter what my friends or family say.

I have good thoughts about people, and I don't judge people in my head when I talk to them, but I tend to speak my mind sometimes, which I think will make people think about it later on in other situations, which will trigger them to feel a bit bad (maybe I do tease people a bit, but really, it's not because i'm an asshole), maybe later on. I admit that I am a little bit not too talkative in social situations, maybe  that could be why; or people are just stressed then they think of me poking a bit of fun at them and so they think i can be a human pin cushion for their lashing (???).

I'm relatively popular (have many friends and no enemies) among my cohort, I'm academically successful, and I have stable job prospects after graduation.

Naturally, most of my friends and acquaintances think that I should be a happy person. I've even had one person tell me that she looks up to me, which really made my day.

But I've been reflecting on my life over the past few months, and somehow I don't feel happy.

Everywhere I look, people seem to better off than I am. Some of them are blissfully attached, some of them are much more physically attractive, some of them have better job prospects (or are better financially equipped), some of them are massively more popular than I am, and some are simply much smarter than I am.

It's almost as if I feel lonely or even inadequate.

I know, I should appreciate what I have. I'm fortunate enough to have such supportive coursemates and not having to worry about my own finances while studying in NUS.

But I can’t help but feel anxious that at the age of 25, there’s still so much left to do. And this makes me feel so tired all the time.

I’ll admit, some of this is my fault. Perhaps I don’t exercise as much as I should, or I don’t invest enough time in personal grooming, or I don’t work hard enough in socialising or networking with others. (There’s nothing I can do about intelligence, though.)

1048,"Hey everyone, a recent NUS graduate here who's only a few months in my first job and I have something to get off my chest:/

My workplace is a pretty quiet place; I look at four walls around me and talking to people does require a lot of self-initiative on my own part. For the first few months, I thought I was the only new employee before this fellow recent graduate (let's call her X) joined my department. 

My first few meals with X were pretty okay, though I noticed that she's the quiet kind and she isn't a really good texter. Some of the topics that we talked about really struck me deeply on a personal note, but she hasn't been the easiest person to have a conversation with; these conversations not being the smoothest in all honesty. However, I've been struck deeply by her kindness towards strangers (she very often gives money to the old uncles and aunties on wheelchairs without taking their tissue packets without any hesitation) and her own uniqueness and quirkiness; she's a really interesting character and she drew my attention.

The birthday card she gave me a month after, threw me into this deep state of confusion. I'd not received such a card for years; heck, none of my good friends would even consider writing a card for me at all. Despite it being a very simple card with some cute drawings, I was really touched and became extremely keen to know her better on a deeper note. However, she's been very blunt in her refusals when I asked her out at the end of the week on several occasions. It doesn't help that she almost never, never replies me on any sort of chat platform and that we occupy different rooms (her workspace concept is different). And on the few (and fewer) occasions when we actually have lunch, we speak and talk even less. It's incredibly frustrating as a colleague and as a person who wants to know X better; she seems to be now living in her own world and I feel quite torn apart as to what I should do next. She might not be intending this, but I feel that we're becoming strangers, again.

I have to add that I perennially feel bad too; was I too pushy, did I screw up my communications with her, did I talk way too much again and again, and did I make her feel uncomfortable at times? I'm a sucker at communicating anyway:( Having thought that she's at the same lifestage as I am, I thought that we could've built a deeper relationship with each other beyond just mere colleagues. But it's so frustrating when she's not the best in social situations (and awareness even) and that I just don't get her. I can't understand her, yet I still want to and yearn to know her better at a deeper level.

I'm so confused with X, terribly, terribly confused. What's wrong with me, and I wonder, why do I even bother? Am I still screwing up these sort of situations? I don't know anymore, perhaps I'm just wasting my time after all. To X, if you ever figure out who this is and what I'm saying, I just wanted to say that your fellow new colleague here isn't the best in talking either and that he just wants to be on the same wavelength as you.

But I guess, I'll just press F to pay respects to myself.

I don’t come from a well-to-do family. My dad works as a full-time grab driver while my mom works as an admin staff. I have an elder brother (reaching his 30s) who works part time and has no aspirations to seek a stable, full-time career (a story for another day). I take home about 3k a month and gives my parents allowances each. My mom has always been the one managing the bills in the household, making payments and ensuring that the bills don’t accumulate. My dad, however, stays silent when it comes to making payments. My mom does not ask dad directly for money, as she is afraid he will get angry for no reason nor logic (which he does, many times). Once, the electricity bills accumulated beyond 1k, and it was only when the electricity got cut off that I realise the bill had not been paid for several months. When my mom hinted to my dad, he just continued to ignore and played his phone games. On other days, my dad always says he does not have money to buy anything (sometimes even for our dinner, or when the family suggested eating something fancier - e.g. KFC/chili crabs). However, he is ever-ready to fork out money towards things or events that can massage his ego (e.g. relatives’ wedding dinners, friends’ business ventures, friends borrowing money). He doesn’t seem to be able to prioritise paying for what is required first, such as the bills. 
I admit, as an adult who still lives with my parents, I haven’t done my part to actively check if the bills are being paid on time. I hand allowances to parents thinking that a part of it will be used to pay for the bills. 
Time to time, my mom tells me not to get a husband who carries similar characteristics as my dad. This broke me as I’ve always wanted to believe I have a family who can be happy and share about anything under the sun, despite not being well to do. As a family, we don’t share about our feelings, troubles or anything deeper than surface level questions, such as whether we’ve eaten our meals or what we felt like eating. I can’t wait to move out and live just with my mom. I believe our lives will be much better that way.

If they want polish their cv, it’s their own taichi. But many of them choose to be snakes, how? They push the workload they are supposed to do to vice directors, fellow committee members or subcommittee members, i.e. to say their “subordinates” or “colleagues”. Some even better, disappear from the event they are in charge of on the day of the event, then take the credit for being the overall IC of the event! Why? Maybe because they cannot cope or they are just free riders. Then they apply for their job with their cv glitters like gold, they take home all the credit. 

I also got a question for any potential employers here, I like to hear your views on this. Do you watch out for these type people? Imagine you encounter interviewee with very thick cv, claims to have participated in many many activities. How you differentiate someone who really contributes properly to all the activities he/she mentioned in the cv, vs those who participate in name only in those activities slacking their way thru, just to get the credit? Or is it common that these ppl can cheat their way thru and we just have to suck thumb on it? Like the saying goes “welcome to the real world”?

So while I was in America for a brief visit, I had dinner with some locals there. Everything was going great, and that’s when a friend of a friend said this to me -

“So, you are from Singapore right? I heard that everyone in your village knows each other... I mean... as it is just very small?”

- and I didn’t know if it was just the term ‘village’ or just the way he said it, but I felt defensive and surprised, although I tried to play it off while explaining to him what our city-state is really like... He is actually someone who had the reputation of being a really intelligent guy, so I was doubly surprised by this question/assumption he made.

I wish more foreigners would know about Singapore, and all we have achieved. We are a proud, futuristic nation and I daresay a lot better managed through the years with great prospects ahead due to our smart decisions and achievements. That’s all.

1. We BTOed after being together for 3 months. That's how much she trust and love me. And I love her very much too. I am sure she is the one for me. We have met each other's parents.
2. She is a very considerate girl. She only gave me the keys because she did not want me to wake up too early for work. She did inform her parents after she gave me the keys and her parents did not say anything. But other family members become damned unreasonable after they know. They started locking their doors and refused to talk to us. Afterall, her parents have given their implicit consent, so how can they treat her like that? That's so unfair to her. I stayed over throughout CNY and I will be living in her house after we get married.
3. We are always considerate of other living members in the house. We always lock the door when we have happy times and we will wait untill everybody in the house are asleep before we do it. 

You see, she is a really nice girl that wants to have happy relationships. I don't think she deserve any of this drama.

I have thoroughly lost all faith in the electrical engineering education at NUS. As a recent graduate, I noticed that the awards and As for the final year projects were given out to projects that simply replicate past research, be it everyone merely blindly applying machine learning and neural network algorithms, or projects that even high school students could complete. The implementations are executed perfectly but there is zero original content. These projects slip through because of differing standards between examiners and a useless rubric with poor English. But I don't blame the students at all. There is simply no longer a spirit of mentorship where professors guide students to conduct genuine research. Undergraduates are instead seen as a burden to be graduated as soon as possible. It is not a surprise that Singapore finds herself lacking in research talent in this area when the standards are set so low. And yet, here we are complaining about how foreign engineers depress salaries. I sincerely hope that NUS Engineering wakes their idea up (or finds their Prof. Ben) before the dearth of engineering talent continues. To my fellow graduates, there is a wealth of opportunity outside  Singapore. Hone your expertise overseas, craft a niche for yourself and you'll find yourself in demand.

1063,"A few years ago, the 3 of you asked me to do a Special Term module. This one had 1.5 times the workload for a group of 4 and half the time to complete it. Now, not all of us are equally strong in this field. That's fine, I just need one person to deal with the hardware while I deal with the software, and the rest can do the remaining stuff. 

And what happened to the best one among you to do it? After submitting the application form, you told us that you were going to work outside. Working outside while taking ST modules was a direct violation of department policy - it was explicitly mentioned on the forms we submitted, but you did it anyway. And this was before NUS would refund us Special Term fees if we graduated on time, so we were all paying out of pocket for that. But fine, I kept quiet. Friends, right? And so I ended up doing both the software and hardware day and night, even though by now there was not much point in doing Special Term if I'm going to end up soloing most of it.

But while I was part of the struggle, I wasn't part of the celebrations. Instead you all threw me aside the moment I was no longer of any use to you. Right after graduation, you all went to Japan without me, and to top it all off, probably with the profits gotten off me, too. You could have at least let me know about the trip if you didn't think I should go. But instead everyone else seemed to know what was going on except me.

By now, all the evidence showed that all along, you all took me as nothing more than a useful idiot. But I still gave you all the benefit of the doubt. Later when we met again, I was even prepared to compromise and let you all talk about the trip, though only for a while, despite all this. And you went ahead and talked about only that for the whole night, as if I needed any reminding.

For those that came to talk to me about it, even those not involved in the whole issue, I thank you for that, and at least we can move on. But ultimately, the rest of you have shown absolutely zero remorse for your actions.

You could have stepped up to take charge of the project, but instead I had one guy that went to moonlight.

You could have asked me along for the trip, but instead you all decided that I wasn't worthy. Except maybe for funding your trip.

You could have at least told me about it then. But no, I was ranked below everyone else, fit for nothing but clearing your shit.

You could have talked about just about anything else when we next met, but instead you all still had the cheek to talk about the trip non-stop for more than 3 hours in my presence, on top of everything you did.

And even after all that, at a minimum, you could have apologized. Some did, some didn't. And some of you decided to cut me off entirely on all social media channels, which is why I'm posting this here.

Not very significant to some but for those who spend an entire sem of lectures/tutorials in UTown the general cost of ""eating"" was already 1.5-1.8× compared to anywhere else in NUS. And then in Engin since Techno closed food prices has almost doubled - gone were the days we could settle on a meal for $2.80-3.20 and instead many of the popup stalls are selling at least $4.50 and above.

Was told by some of my friends about a post circulating on NUSWhispers which bears high resemblance to my situation. I believe the OP of #64974 and #65116 is my ex fiancé. I just want to share my side of the story.

Yes, it’s true that my ex fiancé got a pay rise recently and that ended up with her pay being higher than mine. But what happened was after her pay rise, I saw a side of her that I never noticed before. She became arrogant, controlling, and bossy. She acted like a know it all. She treated me as if I was a beggar who needed her to feed me. When we’re out with our friends, she acted as if she was the boss and I was her subordinate. When you’re treated like her subordinate when in reality you’re not, how can you not lose face?

Now that I’ve seen her post on NUSWhispers, i can be even more certain that I made the right decision to call off the wedding. I saw one of her posts which called me childish. Well let me say she is the real childish one. Why is she so childish that she has to go onto such an anonymous forum to rant, instead of communicating directly with me? If my future wife is this type of person who will stab me the back and complain about everything we disagree on by ranting anonymously online, then of course I would call off the wedding!

If anyone wants to say that I’ve drooped to as low as her by posting this post anonymously online, let me say to them this: I myself am only commenting here because I want to give everyone here the other side of the story. And also to warn others against falling into the situation that I’m in now.  To those guys out there, these type of women are toxic. If you ever come across this type of women, LEAVE HER AT ALL COSTS.

Meanwhile my friend is someone who DIE DIE must always eat at hawker centre and if any kind of food is above $5, she'll give it a pass.


DISCLAIMER; I'm in no way saying there's anything wrong with eating hawker food (I love hawker food myself) or that I look down on her for eating hawker food (tbh her family's well off and she's just the super thrifty kind). Whenever I hang out with her, we'll end up at hawker centre even for special occasions. I can live with that. After all, I've other friends who I can eat at so-called fancier places with.


What I can't stand is when let's say we're walking together in a mall and I choose to buy Koi or Gong Cha or any 'fancy' food like Chateraise cake or ice cream and she'll straight up tell me how with that one caramel milk tea I just bought, she could buy like 2 plates of Cai Png.

I have not found a full-time job nor an internship (even unpaid internships, rejected). Now, I do not command for very high pay, heck I even applied to jobs outside my faculties. I attended job fairs. I attended career workshops on grooming myself for interviews. I even applied for frontline jobs, of which I did do some as part-time. But many places rejected me, and I have heard because I was overqualified and even tell me, ""It's a waste of my degree"", and I told them was perfectly fine getting the basic pay everyone else was getting. Honestly I am very burnt out. I still apply for jobs, I seek feedback from employers if I am not considered. Always thankful for those who do, because it makes me a better candidate for future interviews or shows why I didn't get a job. Sometimes, they don't want you if your ""specialty"" is something else even within your field. It's like you are damned if you don't study hard in Singapore. And damned if you get a degree because nobody is willing to hire you as a fresh graduate as they say ""you lack relevant experience"". Where is that experience going to drop from? The sky? I also get tired when people keep suggesting fix-it solutions (including my parents) when I really reinvent myself every time... with the same result.

I concede that they are relatively more environmentally friendly than plastic straws because they can biodegrade. But still it harms the environment.

Really ridiculous that we are changing from one item that is not environmentally friendly (plastic straw) to another that is also not environmentally friendly (paper straw) - both are single use items. Makes people feel that we eliminated plastic straws as a PR stunt, and not because we really care for the environment

That’s why I fully support OP’s suggestion to introduce a price on paper straws. 50 cents or 1 dollar would be a good price to start. We should all just drink from the cup directly. As for those ppl who want their bubble tea with pearls should just bring their own metal straws or pay up for the straws.

I really hope that the relevant ppl in charge think about this.

1097,"I started ghosting one of my best friends. 

We met in January this year collaborating on an event project, and her personality, capability and reliability immediately drew my attention. After the project concluded, we stayed in contact. Our personalities, interests and even food preferences matched like lock and key. We never ran out of things to talk about. We grew close very quickly. Even though I barely knew her for half a year, it felt like I've known her since forever. I genuinely thought she's the one for me then, and was determined to go for it.

But then I found out, she's happily attached. I was devastated. Still, I told myself to calm down. As long as I drew the line, I can still keep her as a friend, which I genuinely want to, because it is really difficult to find someone who totally understands you. So I sorted out my emotions, and continued as if nothing was wrong, reminding myself to not cross that line. 

Despite this, I crossed the line time and time again. As much as I can tell, she either didn't notice, or pretended not to know. However, our mutual friends definitely noticed. They talked to me, warned me not to play with fire. After some struggles, I decided that something needs to be done. I did the only thing that I thought was the best for both of us. I stopped contacting her. I stopped replying her messages. I disconnected with her on social media. I ghosted her. 

As much as I want her to know how much she meant to me, I can't. Because nothing good will happen if she knows. I really thank her for the past few months, for those are really the happiest moments of my life. I know whatever I'm doing now is not the most mature thing to do, but I don't know how else to manage this. I tried to draw the line, but end up crossing it again and again. In some sense, I brought this on myself. 

The most difficult part of this, is cutting out someone from your life, when that person has only made your life better, and nothing else.

1098,"In view of so many posts on global warming, I believe there are some additional measures worth considering:
1. increase the price of takeaway containers in the canteens. Currently it only costs 20 cents per container. It’s too cheap, people don’t mind paying and still use it freely. Sad. Should increase the price of container to 50cents or even 1 dollar
2. Charge for paper straws. Although we already eliminated plastic straws, paper straws are also single use and cause harm to the environment (albeit relatively less, but still causes harm). Price should be around 50 cents or even 1 dollar per straw. Remember, the straw is not a necessity, we can always drink directly from the cup.
3. Charge for leftover food. Food wastage is a real problem in sg. We should lead the nation in campaigning against food wastage and aim to reduce it. At the tray return stations, they should set up a ez link reader, anyone with food left on their plates have to tap their ez link card to deduct 50cents as a penalty.
4. Meat tax. As said in a previous post by someone else, a lot of CO2 is produced in rearing animals. 50% tax is a good number to begin with.
5. Sugary drinks tax. Although not directly related to global warming, it relates to our health. Sugar drinks can cause obesity and diabetes. It’s as harmful as alcohol. Thus we should impose a tax on sugary drinks similar to alcohol, such as 50% of original price.
6. Air con tax. Applies to public spaces with aircon. Such as UTown fine food canteen, subway, science canteen (aircon portion), Yih canteen. Charge a tax for aircon, 50cents per entry. Set up a ezlink card machine at the entrance. Everyone has to tap their ezlink card on the machine when entering.
7. Water cooler. It takes quite a bit of electricity to cool down the water. On alternate days, we should just turn the power off to safe electricity. We can survive on water at room temperature, doesn’t have to be ice cold. Ice cold water is a want, not a need. If anyone wants ice cold water they can buy from the canteen drinks stall.
8. Carbon emissions tax for internal shuttle bus. Set up readers that read ezlink cards on buses, both at entrances and exits. Riders have to tap in and tap out. If people ride for 2 stops or less [they can just walk instead], they have to pay $2. If people ride more than 2 stops [in this case they really need the shuttle bus], it remains free. Means that for the latter group when they tap their ezlink cards on the reader when exiting, they get a full refund of the money deducted when they tapped in when they entered the bus.

I actually haven’t been back home for a few years, main reason being my parents in their 60s split up and my mum ended up moving out. They did that right after I’ve completed my degree as they claimed that they didn’t want their decision to interfere with my studies. I’ve never set foot in my home again as I could never bear the feeling of stepping into a broken home, it feels very overwhelming and I would get very worked up inside and couldn’t express it. 

I spent the last few years renting outside, and now I just got a text from my dad saying my dog who has been with me since I was in secondary school died. I’ve taken care of her since she was a puppy and she had been my solace everytime something bad happened to me, everytime my parents fought I would bring her to my room and play with her, which is pathetic I know but she is sort of my friend.

Although the examples given by OP generalised scenarios that lean toward the extreme, there are plenty of instances where a subdued versions widely occur. I.e. girls thinking that they are an object of interest when they aren't. Maybe most of you can't contrast the typical local girl with another who lives abroad so there's no comparison to be drawn, but ask anyone who has lived in a foreign country to tell you the difference. In general, local girls do give themselves more credit when it's due when it comes to their self-image in a bid to seem more desirable.

1106,"Global warming is real. That’s why I think nus should implement air con free Monday from next semester onwards. We use so much air con from labs to libraries to tutorial rooms to some canteens. Think about this as earth day, we can implement a similar concept by having people switch off their air con every Monday. It will save a lot of electricity on the school as a whole. At the same time build up nus reputation as one of the institutions that is forward looking and creative in solving problems.

I also have another drastic but creative idea. We can consider doing this once a year during earth day. You see, temperatures at night are cooler than during the day. During earth day each year, class timings should be shifted 12 hours later, e.g. if you have a 8am class on earth day, you report at 8pm; if you have a 1pm class, your class for that day would be at 1am, 12 hours later. with everyone working at night when it is cooler for that day, we can reduce air con and electricity usage. it can send a very strong message that we are serious about reducing electricity consumption, and the publicity resulting from it can promote our reputation as a university in a good way.

1107,"I am a male student staying on campus here. I went for my ippt last Saturday, and I was very impressed by the safety measures taken by the saf. As usual, they have their supervising officer, conducting officer, and safety officer during the event. There was a medic, doctor, and safety rover standing by, with all the medical equipment in place should any emergency occur. They conduct safety briefings at the start of the event lasting 15 mins long. Someone almost fainted during the event due to dehydration, but thanks to the medical people on standby, it was quickly brought under control.

Comparing this to what happens during every evening on campus, I feel that there are insufficient safety measures in place for those of us who jog around nus on the pavements during the evening time. If somebody were to toh, that would be it. No medic, no doctor, no safety rover. If you think about it, you should be worried.

We should ban jogging around the campus immediately as a short term measure. Next, in the long term there should be a roster set up among the different halls/rc on campus. I.e to say each night, the hall/rc on duty should provide a supervising officer, conducting officer and safety officer. They should conduct a mass warm up and cool down sessions for those who wish to exercise i.e. to say jogging. They should also conduct a safety briefing before the start of each activity, similar to the army.

Next, we should enlist medical students and/or those with first aid background to provide medical cover. Maybe those males who were medics in the army previously should be enlisted to help as well. For every evening where there is jogging, there should be at least one first aider and one medical student (playing the role of doctor) on standby.

We should also get a volunteer with a car to act as the transport operator, in case any casualty needs evacuation to the nearest hospital, I.e. to say NUH. Maybe those males who were transport operators in the army previously can be enlisted to help also.

In summary, I propose to implement the safety measures every evening to facilitate people who wish to jog, I.e. to say have people fill these roles every evening: supervising officer, conducting officer, safety officer, medic (a.k.a first aider), doctor (a.k.a. medical student), transport operator (a.k.a. driver), and a car (playing the role of a safety rover). 

I believe we are smart enough to implement safety measures BRFORE s**t happens, and not the other way round I.e. to say only implementing safety measures AFTER s**t happens.

1109,"Since there are so many posts about foreign girls and sg girls let me shed some light on between them. Sg girls like to automatically assume that guys are interested in them when guys approach or talk to them. Foreign girls are opposite. They will assume neutral stance and put necessary effort to keep the conversation going, while appreciating the effort from the guy for the first move. They would be more open minded but still cautious and amicable. Unless the guy back out, she will still be there to talk to. Unlike the usual sg girl who would play hard to get, pretend never read message, act busy and assume guys should make them feel interested. 

Im sure many guys who have experienced this before some random girls who they find cute at first but after making the first move (which they lacked of skills to make guys interested to continue) they can simply use the 3 words “im not interested” like as if the guy is very interested in them in the first place. It is not just rude but how disgusting they place themselves on a pedestal. Then blame the guy cannot take a “rejection” or behave like kid if we tell them off about it. What a joke. If we didnt tell them then they will continue to live in their own world. Most guys are just trying to see if a conversation can be continued but the sg girl would assume they are some prize trophy waiting for someone worthy to claim. To think of it even if the guy is worthy why would he want a girl with such attitude. It is a trick to see their true character. 

Another scenario guys can be familiar with. When u go clubbing if u managed to talk to some sg girls and they come to your table, after drinking your drinks they will just sit there and do nothing with a poker face or rather waiting for the guys to entertain them instead. To make things uglier they will go away to mingle with others and then return back when they need your drinks or cannot find any others more fun out there. For foreign girls needless to say they will be there and not behave so cheapskate. Foreign girls have better eq and they can have all character brains and looks at the same time. For sg girls only can only have one or two at most. 

In overseas when u happen to see a IT female promoter dressed in a model type of skimpy outfit they can promote the products at the same time using the microphones alone. In sg we will need another emcee to do the promoting and the girl just stand there for show. 

I think sg guys should look for a better alternative and stop being insulated in our own sg girls cos they are definitely over priced or lagging in terms of character from the rest of the world. Many seniors have also advise me that. I think it is true and getting worst as the time goes by.

1112,"Hi, I specialise in food science. Insects contain large amounts of protein, and can provide for a lot of the nutrients our body needs. On my recent trip to overseas, I ate some insects. I have to say they taste amazing. Believe me, it tastes much better than it looks. It can also help reduce global warming because less they don’t give out as much carbon dioxide as animals.

This is my suggestion: set up a stall in every canteen in nus selling insects. One way is to combine it with the mala stall. The various spices they use go very well with such insects. Many of the mala stall owners are from China, so they should be familiar with the concept since it is common in their hometowns. To encourage people to eat insects at the start, they should throw in a few insects for free for every mala purchased.

Second suggestion: flour can be made from grinding insects into powder. This type of flour has higher protein content than regular flour. So the Arise & Shine bakeries should start to use flour made from insects to make their bread. I bet that most people eating the bread won’t even notice the difference if the flour was changed. To encourage people to accept this new type of flour at the start, they should consider quietly changing the type of flour without people knowing.

Together, we can help to reduce global hunger and global warming by consuming insect products.

1114,"To OP of #64751, I generally agree with your post. But your last sentence “less drastic steps like meat free monday might be a good start”, I cannot accept. In fact I am outraged by this statement.

First, isn’t meat free Monday imposing a diet which others don’t like once every week. Do you think this is fair? And not to forget those people you mentioned in your post that some people who need to eat meat for health reasons: what are they going to do every Monday? Carry out fasting?

Second, you said it is a “good start”. So let me ask you, what is a “good end”? Make all stores vegan? But that would contradict your view that “i dont believe ALL stalls should be made vegan”. So I really don’t know what your overall idea for the long run is.

And also my personal view is that having such a “good start” can be a slippery slope to something more extreme: reducing variety of meat choices, shortage of options etc. To those kind of left wing people who espouse veganism, “if you give them an inch, they will demand a mile”, just to borrow a phrase from one of the comments in the earlier post on vegan. 

So if you realise you don’t like vegan food after they introduce one or two stores, plus the meat free Monday, do you think you can reverse the process towards veganism, let alone to stop it in its tracks?

P.s. if meat free mondays are implemented next semester, I will bring my own canned luncheon meat and/or bacon and ham every Monday.

1121,"To OP of #64691, I strongly agree with your idea of reducing meat consumption. I would like to suggest an alternative method, you can call it a sort of compromise. Those who like meat can continue to eat meat in school canteens while at the same time reducing overall meat consumption using this method.

The method I’m referring to is introducing a tax on all meat products sold in canteens. If you look at it in the economic sense, you can call meat a “demerit good”, with negative externalities. In other words, the price of meat is too cheap to reflect the actual cost which it does harm to the society in terms of CO2 emissions. Too low price causes us to consume more meat than we should, so we should raise the price to reduce overall consumption. I suggest that the tax should be on a similar proportion to alcohol tax, maybe 50% of original price?

The extra money collected from this tax can be used to fund the university to provide us with better facilities, or even better, invest in green facilities such as the zero carbon footprint building near/in FASS (if I remember correctly?)

To those naysayers calling for the OP in the other article to go and die, I say to them, think about the world you want to live in 50 years from now. Think about the world your children will live in. How will you answer them if they ask you why you never play your part to reduce climate change?

Although it’s true not having kids is one of the best ways to reduce ur carbon emissions, and I guess not being alive as well would reduce ur carbon footprint...but still...how could you tell someone they’re better off dead just because you think their suggestion (to help others I might add) isn’t a good one?

What I mean is that your superior’s aim should always be to achieve certain goals for the team, for them to succeed. You may disagree about the methods, but the ultimate aim is always correct and undebatable.
b) If you think your superior (or boss) is wrong, refer to (a).
This applies to working under your various directors of various committees in uni.

3) Discipline is key. Without discipline, you cannot keep yourself and your team on track to reach your goal. Sometimes occasionally in civilian setting it may therefore be useful to carry a knock it down to drill the message into our heads.
This is important in studying well and achieving good grades.

Obviously the army does have it’s dark side, but we should complain less and always be positive about everything (including the army) to succeed.

1127,"After seeing so many guys post about not having a girlfriend and some being salty over, here's my two cents on this topic.

Sg girls are materialistic? Hell, with Singapore's living standards, who wouldn't want a richer bf/husband? 

Princess syndrome? If we made it to uni, I'm sure we should have enough ability to support ourselves in the future, even if single. So why the need to find a boyfriend or husband and needing to burden ourselves with caring for a family while working (which, as mentioned, Singapore cost of living so high, unless husband rich enough to support family, wives need to work also) With these considerations, the female will want to find a guy to ""pamper"" her.

Of course, there is a certain extent to how much princess syndrome should be tolerated, and my views are not representative of every female. 

My point is: 1.higher requirements for bf/husband considering the extra burden in the future 2. Pls, guys, take a look at urselves too, so many manchilds and immature guys whose egos are inflated... what do you think u can offer in a relationship?

It is just so hard to get matches since the gender ratio and activeness is so skewed that I realized getting 1 match per week is already considered a lot. I chatted with my friends that also using dating apps and realize not getting any match in months is totally normal. And those guys are not even unattractive type with some of them eventually able to get girl friend in real life. 

Even after getting matches, many of them are not even responsive to your messages and you really have to be really good or lucky to get them out in real life. So far I was only able to get 2 of them out out of the 20-30 matches (excluding clearly catfish profiles). I think most girls on those app are deeply suspicious of those apps too. One of the girl that I asked out tell me she thought I am some kind of player of be on those app.

Really unless you are so desperate that you are willing to accept girls a few league below you, dating apps probably will not work for you at least if you are like me who is not willing to spend any money to unlock helping features. But then again even if you are desperate enough unless you are considerably attractive already, you will not even be get any girls out in real life to begin with.

They choose to be officers because they want to serve in the best way they can, and there are a lot of things I learn from my bf which I try to apply in uni where I am now.

For e.g. I demand complete loyalty from my group members if I’m the group leader. Notice that the concept of first among equals does not apply in the army, instead it’s top down which is much more effective. I also demand military style punctuality when it comes to meeting times.

Last week, my group members dropped 20 for me when they were late by 20 seconds for our meeting. Similarly, when I was late for my date with my bf, I dropped 20 for him too.

Some of you may ask, how do you get your people to follow you like that? My answer is, show them you can achieve what you set out to do first, then they will respect you and listen to your command. In fact, all my group members say they prefer working under me compared to others who don’t adopt my approach.

People generally find it weird that I don't want a wedding at all. It seems that society expects couples to want a large-scale, overly expensive wedding and make a huge show to show off to relatives. 

Well, I absolutely hate the idea of being one of the stars of such a large scale social event, and having to socialize with so many unknown people. I also don't understand why there is a need to spend so much (almost an entire year's worth of savings!!! It could be better spent on my BTO loan and renovation, even for my future baby) on an event which is going to tire the couple really badly. After being the maid of honor for my best friend's wedding, I seriously doubt I would enjoy myself on my wedding day. Having to wake up at 3am to do 3 hours of hair and makeup for $800 is insane. Gatecrashing is bullshit. Asking my fiancee to spend thousands on crap like cakes and suckling pigs as offerings to my relatives (to show how much he loves me) is also unnecessary, because my mum died unexpectedly of cardiac arrest this year, and the amount of help and support my fiancee selflessly offered to my family is already more than sufficient proof of how much he loves me.

I'm so frustrated that my dad thinks of me as selfish for not wanting a huge wedding. I would very much prefer a simple restaurant meal with close relatives and friends, so that all my wedding guests wouldn't feel pressured to give me an angbao containing a minimum of $200 for each person. Plus, I could even have more meaningful conversations with my guests if they are mostly close relatives and friends.

I am so sick and tired of getting stressed out every time I am discussing wedding plans with my dad and relatives, because they keep imposing their ideals and expectations on me. And I need to make decisions that make THEM happy. I am tired of prioritizing others' happiness above my own. Discussions about my wedding plans almost always causes me to end up in tears due to stress. Why is it that when I prioritize my happiness, my dad calls me selfish? It's like I exist purely to make him happy at the expense of my own happiness. The worst thing is that when I cry over this issue, my dad will invariably chide me, saying I am for 'crying over nothing' and 'cry cry cry for what? no meaning!!!'... effectively invalidating my feelings and making me feel worse.  All my life, he has always scolded me for crying, with the exception of when I cried after my mum died. It makes me wonder if he is a narcissistic parent who thinks that his child should never show negative emotions in reaction to his parenting. 

I just want to call off the whole wedding and end my life so I don't have to worry about anything anymore. :( If anyone has been through a similar situation, I would appreciate it greatly if I could PM you to have a chat. Thanks for reading my rant.

Since my first year, I've been someone very actively involved in student activities (Camps, Rag, Student Life Fair, Open Day, you name it). I stayed in Hall too so I had a lot of involvement and made many close friends from there.

Thankfully I managed my time well so I still did decently for my studies and already secured a job at Jurong Island. Having said that, I also know that working life will probably never be as vibrant and relaxed as student life. My work will mostly be operational type at a petrochemical firm so the daily and weekly routine would be pretty standard throughout the year I guess.

How do you stay positive and motivated without feeling jaded with work life and always keep reminiscing about your undergrad years? At least when we were studying, we had the Dec and summer holidays to look forward to, something like an end goal and a break after studying so hard in the semester. But once we start working, there's practically no end to the grind till you retire. How do you keep yourself going apart from looking forward to the paycheck?

Every semester till year 4 we are pre-allocated 4 core mods (worth 16MCs), and there is a high chance the timetable for these 4 pre-allocated mods will clash with the CT mods. This happened to us in semester 2, so we couldn’t take it. In semester 1 we were pre-allocated GER1000 on top of our 4 core mods, and we could not overload then since it would exceed the limit set for freshmen.

Unlike our friends from other courses, we don’t have the  flexibility to change our pre-allocated core mods to fit in the CT mod.

I know there's already a category called ""advice"", but it seems more geared toward people wishing to receive advice. I think it will be great if there can be a category which allows us to give general suggestions to improve the university as well.

1181,"So I have noticed a worrying trend within relationships where both people are Singaporean. I've noticed that in many instances, the male is distrustful of the female as well as overly manipulative and controlling. Now, i'm not saying that this is the case in all situations, but I have spoken to too many girls who's boyfriends or guys that they are dating believe that they have some sort of ownership right over them.
This ranges from controlling what they wear to who they are allowed to see. Also, the way that couples communicate with each other doesn't seem to be very conducive to a healthy relationship as when one raises a concern they have, there isn't a lot fo support, but rather complaining about how much of a burden it is for them to be sharing this. 

I say this as a foreigner dating a Singaporean girl as her exes did this as do the current and previous boyfriends of her friends. I ask, why can't there be mutual respect, love and understanding and where is this coming from?

Meanwhile others found hardworking groupmates and did well for the project. The EE curriculum has more project-based mods next year. I don't want to again be in the shitty situation of having no one to group with and being left to pair with the bottom of the barrel.

Yes I'm talking about modules with heavy weightings on the final exams; there is no paper trail to speak of, no avenue to contest final grades on.

My story is one that’s is unique, I lived and settled in Box Hill (the largest Chinese Australian community in Melbourne), as a result I had very little angmoh friends and most of my friends are either ABCs or Singaporean students.

I am so saddened to see how many Singaporeans are ashamed of their identity so much that they will fake accents once they go back to Singapore for a holiday, not most Singaporeans overseas but a lot.

Try to have some contentment with your Singaporean identity, a few of my ABC friends tell me they want to move to Singapore because it meets their needs of balancing Asian and Western culture together.

But that said I do find myself in a dilemma where I am confused and conflicted about my cultural identity.

1208,"Big wall of text warning! Hello, NTU engineering fresh grad here, set to receive result tmr. Had accepted offer of gross approx 5.5k/month include bonus as a fresh grad with no relevant work experience. So guys pls stop spreading fear that engineering is a gooner path. 2.5k-2.7k is low balling? IMHO yes, before I got my offer, I applied and was interviewed by at least 6 different places, Micron, SMRT etc etc, I was never told that they offer anything CLOSE to 2.5k - 2.7k. 

Is 3k ideal according to one comment? My answer is NO. However, 3k was the ideal average starting pay 6-7 years back before the government steps in to promote public sector engineering. Big MNC that values same attributes as government such as having high GPA, good CCA records step up the game and followed up. According to salary.sg the average salary of starting pay for NUS mechanical engineer gross about 3.9k (Include Bonus). So stop spreading fear how 4k is unrealistic. Its up to how you manage to find these employers.

Now the interesting question comes, so why am I not getting any of such offer? Well heres the reality check you really need. Engineering fresh grad position with the government usually take in people with 2nd upper or above only or 2nd lower if you have some decent internship experience related. They are also more demanding of your resume and interviewing skills. So, if you have anything 2nd lower or below, or has 0 Leadership/CCA track record dont expect anything near the market. Also because engineering fresh grade are so widely employed, the 2nd important question you need to ask yourself is, what exactly is this place you applied? How well known and credible are they? What are the work values the company prioritised? Are they a company that value cheap engineering/labor? Safe and expensive engineering methodology?  Or simply some decent local engineering done in English? If you applied for a random unknown SME and some few MNC, that prioritise cheap engineering labor, then you will be competing with engineering fresh grad all over the world (E.g india, where the school fee is about 1k SGD per semester), in that case it is completely justified that they offer you something like 2.5k when they can replace you with some one willing to do the same thing for 1.5k. Its all how you position yourself. 
Also, if you are an engineering fresh grad, FCH, has some leadership roles in CCA, proven comfortable picking up programming. You should have no problem competing your monthly figure with comp science FCH, then again that’s only if you are able to achieve them. So far among my clique, the highest paid fella took an offer of about 7k+ gross with scholarship. Hes in the dean list, and has an incredible CCA record so I guess that’s properly about where the most you can get without plenty of job experience, for an engineering fresh grad. If you want to ask if I know anyone who has 6k-7k without scholarship, so far, I haven’t met any. But I’m sure I can find one if I ask around actively.

And you know what, people like us who got way more than the average usually asked for way lesser during interview and focus on telling employers how we can contribute. Somehow I realise prestigious employers seems to like us more this way and end up offering us way higher.

Lastly, I guess most of my friends are generally academically well of. I’m quite surprised there are people who knows not of a single one getting more than 4k/month. 4k/month gross including bonus is really common in 2018. 4k basic per month is properly average for mechanical/eee FCH. i think some people seems to mix up the 2. At least thats what statistic said.

Until recently, I realised I may not be as introverted as I thought. My long term partner is currently working overseas for a few months and I realised how lonely I really was. 

I started to initiate more meet ups with my close friends and the not so close ones hoping to kill the boredom.

I’ve also noticed that whenever a female makes a slightly controversial comment on this forum, other commentators are quick to jump in to condone and attack her. These girls who speak out are often branded as insecure, emotional, and using “feminism as a shield” to blame people. On the other hand, tons of derogatory comments that are made by other male commentators are largely ignored. (With the exception of the female commentator with the chinese name, I know) 

You don’t have to look far. This forum is exactly the manifestation of gender inequality. This is exactly why feminism is needed. It’s never about hating men or wanting special treatment etc. It’s about feeling safe and having the ability to express yourself, go on about your daily activities in life without being stereotyped and threatened because of your gender.

I've dated locals who stayed for years but bailed the moment things got tough and the future prospects I initially seemed on track to materialising fell into uncertainty. 

I'm now married to a Polish woman, who accepted me despite knowing I have multiple sclerosis (which was what made my previous ex leave), and despite my continued inability to pronounce her nearly vowel-less last name. To further shatter the notion that only poor foreign women from second-/third-world countries would readily accept any half-decent Singaporean guy for money or citizenship, my wife came from a well-to-do family. She left behind her life of relative luxury to come here and slog it out with me. She also has a masters degree while I only have my 2.1 bachelors; nonetheless, she's planning to put her career on hold to take care of our kids, or to be the sole breadwinner if my currently mild MS takes a turn for the worse. 

Antagonism is never far away when a relationship/love is contingent on material expectations. In fact, i'd say it's better to not have expectations beyond those about character, personality etc. Basically, love somebody for who they are, not what they can or cannot achieve. Unconditional love, far from making both parties lazy and unmotivated, might actually drive them to achieve and provide for each other. I certainly feel that way. I'm more motivated now to work hard and provide for my wife and future kids than I ever was when I was alone, or in past relationships where I was pressured with expectations.

Normally I’ll just reply ‘they aren’t cute anymore when they grow up’ cos I’m lazy to give them my actual answer. But I’ve had enough of these questions so here is my answer in full: 

I don’t want to bear children just for the sake of my own happiness. Are you saying you want to bring a LIFE into the world just to make yourself feel achieved, validated in society and happy? 

Even if that’s the case, are you sure that you can provide them comfortable and secure lives, even after you die? Amidst erratic climate changes and evil in the world, I don’t see why there’s a need to bring a new life (connected to me by blood) into this place. 

Sure there’s some positivity. They’ll be surrounded w good friends, family, nature and a few more but the list is exhaustive. Is it really worth it? You’ll be the one creating their first pathway into the world. How would you convince me that having children is the best option for my future children’s lives? 

Don’t convince me on how it’s our duty to procreate. Give me more valid reasons why we should bring in innocent beings to suffer, especially when climate change in my opinion is spiraling out of control and can’t be stopped.

To people who would reply with ‘Oh if your parents had the same mindset you wouldn't be here what.’ Guess what? I didn't asked to be here. While I'm really thankful for being born into a supportive family, I'm not too happy with the state of the world today. I wouldn't even be mad if I didn't had this life to begin with. But since I’m here now, I’ll definitely enjoy life just the way I want amidst the negativity I see all around me. 

And that’s why no children for me! I would never want to teach him/her how to look for the silver lining in a cloud. I would only want him/her to see silver linings everywhere:)

That’s also not to say I condemn people who choose to have children. If that is what you want in life then go for it!! I'm just stating my own reasons for not wanting any. Too often individuals see personal choices as an attack on their own but that is not the case. 

We are all free to make our own choices.

I’ve been hanging out with this guy for a few months now, I even confessed and he reciprocates but we decide to keep things casual since none of us can afford a rls at the moment (I need to focus on my studies oversea and he needs to focus on his career). Things were fine for a while but now he stops initiating texts and we basically haven’t talked for almost half a month. I initiated a couple of times before we temporarily stop talking, he replied pretty quickly and still showed enthusiasm, but I don’t want to do that anymore for fear of bothering him and he’s just too nice to tell me straight in the face.
FYI he’s still pretty active on my social media, still likes my pics and sees my snaps so he can’t be too busy to stay in touch. 
Does this mean he doesn’t like me anymore or is he trying to avoid me? I’m so confused.

1222,"Asking for advice - I recently started my first software engineering internship at a start up and was thrown into both frontend and backend with different team leads. There's only a few girls inside the Products/SE team and I am one of them. 
One of the team lead is somewhat irritating? He would grab my notebook that I use to jot down what was discussed etc and read off it, but I don't see him doing that to other engineers (both interns and full-time). He's very pushy to get updates in general. Daily scrum is practiced but he would still walk one round in the office to ""check in"" with all the engineers before lunch and after lunch. 
Also, he keeps assigning me work that would require me to work with him/his team, even though the plan is for me to work with the other team permanently. Furthermore, there's a SE intern who started the same time as me said that team lead was not assigning him work and did not bother to check in with him too.

Am I overthinking it? And what should I do to get him to be less irritating in a nice way?

1223,"There's a difference between having high expectations and being overly-entitled; #63617 strays quite far into the latter.  Ultimately, the reasoning process behind #63617 is ""I am entitled to/expect my boyfriend to be ... because I have a University Education/or my parents spent a lot of money on me/etc"" as if to say that people who did not have the privileged of these things are not entitled to those aspects of a relationship. Obviously there are certain basics from your SO which you should always expect regardless of who you are: you should expect them to be honest, you should expect them to respect you and your autonomy, you should expect them to be fair. But the fact that OP thinks that these privileges are owed to her by her SO only by virtue of her upbringing and education is completely unwarranted. Nobody is entitled to be treated like a prince or princess regardless of how well-educated they are or what privileges life has granted them. If anything, more should be expected from those who've been served those privileges (both in and out of their relationship), but it seems that these privileges have only served to inculcate a false sense of entitlement for the OP. 

What's even more troubling is the amount of support that the post has gotten, seemingly indicating that a large portion of the viewers in NUSWhispers hold on to such entitled and elitist views. But to be honest, I only have pity for them. Strong relationships are built on the basis of mutual effort and reciprocity, this doesn't always mean money and time - but if you're the type of person who'd never be willing to give more than you receive in your relationship, I don't think any of your relationships will ever be successful. You get out from your relationship what you put in. And if you're the type of person to always expect your SO to put in more effort than you in the relationship, then I am convinced that you will never find personal satisfaction with your SO, regardless of who you're SO is or whether your SO is dumb enough to stay.

1225,"This is to all the girls having high expectations of their current/future boyfriends out there.

From a genuinely curious male, what do you girls bring to the table in your relationships (that will actually benefit the male) to warrant such high expectations?

Education? Guys have similar education standards, so what makes you so special? Conversely, if you lack education, why would higher educated guys settle for you?

Financial Independence? Then back up your words by paying for 50% of the house and car. There is no functional difference in a wife that earns 2k or 10k a month if she refuses to spend a cent on things that both parties share.

Taking care of the child and cooking? Monthly maid payments are less than 1k last I checked. 

Please don't mention companionship as we all know that is a 2 way street. 

If you demand so much from the male, be prepared for him to demand the same things from you as well. We want to be boyfriends, not sugar daddies. Males can be generous, but we absolutely dislike relationships on unequal terms where we feel like we are getting taken advantage of.

We are all for gender equality, but please remember that equal rights begets equal responsibilities.

1226,"Aiyah actually all the latest confessions about love can be summed up very simply. The girl in that recent post that got really popular was wrong on many things: incessantly looking down on foreign girls, equating love with money, wanting to be the man's equal (or better) in the relationship but refusing to pay an equal amount, etc. But she did get one thing very very right.

""you are what you attract"". (Not ""you are what you hope you attract"", which she conflates the two -- that's called wishful thinking. I have Scarlett Johansson/10 years ago Joanne Peh standards, means I am them meh? Maybe only my mom would think so.) Go look it up - there are studies that show that people by and large go for their general matches. Socioeconomic match, looks-wise match in particular. Of course you can trade some in either direction but as a rule of thumb not even a billion dollars will turn you from Quasimodo into Li Nanxing (unless you go do surgery lah, but that's a topic for another time. This one not thesis.)

So, long story short, all this debate is not very useful. No amount of hand wringing will challenge the primal human need to preserve social status. If you want rich and hot, better be rich and hot. Otherwise, good luck, no matter how much you insist on high standards, it's not likely going to happen. If you want just hot, you also need to be hot. If you want just rich, you also usually need to be rich (maybe the most flexible one, but still - think about the rich couples you know, and the proportion of them that are actually socioeconomically lopsided.)

Or maybe, just maybe ........... you realize that finding a real life partner to love and to have goes above and beyond these things. That you don't need either of these things to have a loving and happy relationship. 

If you want loving and understanding and supportive and committed, be loving and understanding and supportive and committed. That's the real ""you are want you attract"". It's the most important one. And happily, it's also the one attainable by everyone.

He broke me several times by leaving me then would try to get back with me whenever he felt lonely/ couldn’t find someone better. I always accepted him back because he would bring up something that he was emo about and I can’t bear seeing people sad. I was completely sincere towards him and loved him deeply. He knew and used that to his advantage. He would always say that I was the only one who was always there for him. But I realized too late that I was damaging myself. It’s been months since we last broke up and I’m still trying to heal. It’s been a painful journey but I’ve learnt many valuable lessons, though I’m afraid that I’ll fear dating someone again. I did try dating someone, thinking it’ll help me to move on but I just ended up comparing, because my ex did make me feel a certain way that I’ve never felt before. I’ve rejected a few who’ve asked me out after that. 
I’m the kind who commits and pours love into someone and can’t do flings but seems like these days most young guys don’t want someone who’s “Wife material” and instead someone who can satisfy them sexually without commitment. Love is hard to find these days.

1232,"I am a Singaporean girl and i'm fully aware that i don't represent the entire population of females in Singapore but I have a few things to say to the boys behind #63578 and #63510 . 

1. I have standards and expectations and I set them high including who I want and should date. I set them high because my parents worked very hard all their lives to put me to where I am today. Boy, you don't know how much they worked to put me here. From my phonics lessons in nursery to my honours in the supposedly best uni in Singapore, they allowed me to be earning at least $2,500 per month on my own without depending on anyone. They gave me the power to be financially independent so that I wouldn't have to resort to marrying a rich angmoh just because. 

2. But i still wish to marry a rich angmoh because humans are inherently lazy. I mean I wouldn't mind striking the 12 million TOTO, it's the same kind of feeling. 

3. I set my standards high because I am brought up with lots of love. My parents, my extended family, my teachers, my friends, they accepted me for who I am, they taught me that life is colourful and meaningful because of who I am. I didn't learn about love from a potential lover, i didn't have to wait for him to tell me that I am worth loving. Love was there before boys came into my life. I am not some village girl with 9 siblings who finally experience love just because a boy texts her goodnight, buys her dinner and promises her a citizenship here. 

4. I set my standards high because the boys I've met taught me that love doesn't work out just because you lower your expectations or have no expectations at all. I didn't expect boys to pay for my meals, i didn't expect them to look like Chris Hemsworth or Song Joongki, i didn't expect them to be 100% truthful to me, i didn't expect them to date me exclusively, i didn't expect them to plan surprises and make restaurant or movie reservations ahead, i didn't expect them to be punctual for our dates. But love is not 1+1=2. I lowered my expectations but it still didn't work out. 

5. But those boys taught me that i need to have high standards because it shows that I love myself. They taught me that when i had to wait 1 hour on every date because they overslept, when they confessed that they were seeing someone else, when they want me to pay exactly half the bill and asked me for even the 5 cents in the split, it still freaking hurts. Maybe the foreigner girl is able to put up with all these because they have been through something worse than being disrespected. To be honest, if i really really need to have my time wasted, i would rather stay at home and face the wall. 

6. I set my standards high but they are realistic. I don't expect the boy to give me the moon and the stars because I'm not Megan Fox or Song Hye Gyo. But why should i continue dating a guy who wishes that i retard into 12 years old mental age and stay contented with everything that he bestowed upon me. Maybe the foreigner girl doesn't have people telling her everyday that she has the full potential to fight and achieve much more than what she has today. 

7. I wish for a partner who believes in the best for me, even if the best means that i'll be more successful than him. I wish that he is open-minded and not ashamed that the girl is more ambitious and more opinionated than him. I wish that he will admire me for things that i am capable of and see me as an equal who is able to share burdens with him. Is this too much to ask for in a Singaporean boy who grew up with the same privileges as me? And i don't think going into my 30s or 40s will make me want to hurry and change these wishes... 

8. You are who you attract. I didn't have the high expectations in point 7 and I ended up with liars, cheaters and cowards. If you are a Singaporean guy who is insecure and blames Singaporean girls for having high standards and a sense of entitlement, why not raise your own standards and work towards being a better person so that you can attract the girls with high stardards? 

9. I sincerely wish you look like Chris Hemsworth or Song Joongki because there is a chance you will attract Singaporean girls despite being who you are. I will also suck thumb and take this post back and let you complain about Singaporean girls.

1235,"Seeing all the recent posts on local girls v foreign girls, I just wanna give my 2 cents' worth. Singaporean girls are generally ranked less attractive amongst their Asian counterparts. Given that society (or social media) often associate beauty with big eyes, fair skin, good complexion, almond shaped face, nice tits, small waist, long legs, thigh gap etc, it is no wonder a huge pool of our local girls fall short behind society's definition of beauty. That being said, I think life is far more than just appearances. We should definitely look at traits and character.

Speaking of traits, many local girls cannot cook and prefer not to clean. Can't blame them, given that most Singaporean millennials have a maid (be it Maria, kakak, or Ma). We are programmed from a young age to ""just focus on your studies and leave the rest to us/the maid"" by our parents, so it's understandable that most of us can't cook. Whereas majority of the girls from Malaysia, or China can cook because many of them moved from their hometown to the city and live by themselves, be it for work or studies. I think foreign girls are more independent than local girls in this aspect. 

Lastly I wanna share some thoughts on character. Many think that foreign girls choose to be with local guys because of financial stability, and I agree. Since the dawn of humanity, female has been hardwired to be drawn towards the hunters. It's a survival instinct. likewise, men are drawn towards females who can take care of the family. Apart from the minority extreme cases,  end of the day I believe that what attracts both parties to each other are more than just appearances and money. There's just no hard and fast rules on dating.

1236,"When I think of Singaporean girls, I let out a really big *SIGH*. 

When you’re in your teens things were much simpler. It was about spending time together and having that naive dream of being together forever. 

As we age and move into the working world, expectations change and it is no longer about who loves us most but what the other party can give. 

I’ve been on multiple dates overtime and I tell you that girls look out for financial, social, emotional, physical and spiritual aspects when choosing a partner. You can pour your heart out for them but they’ll just ignore you and think it’s normal for a guy to do so. Fall short and you’ll be axed from their list. 

The decent looking ones, they have options and they’ll move on quickly just like that without a blink of an eye. In the age of online dating, girls cycle through guys faster then ever.

To be a Singaporean guy, the expectations are high. The more educated and successful the girl, the harder it gets. Yes there are exceptions but rare and already taken. 

The silver lining comes when the girl was too choosy or not lucky enough to find a suitable partner by 30. There’s a mad rush to settle. Meanwhile those in their mid twenties? They’ll just have fun while waiting.

I’ve heard multiple times how foreign girls are easier to please. It’s true. Our girls are materialistic.

Hence, for the guys that have good gf or wife, hang on tight. For those who live through the demands, endure well!

I only have my own methods, so just want to gather some opinions and suggestions. Meanwhile, various examples of what I mean (feel free to tag yourself):
- Male colleague was going to marry someone from another dept (say sales). One of my bosses, in a big dept meeting where the guy wasn't around, said: ""Eh, <guy> and sales will be sleeping together! AHAHAHAHA!"" 
- Met another company's representative who made jokes about dirty Indians and Geylang public toilet.

My fairly-limited range of responses
- Just don't laugh and give a blank face. (Admittedly sometimes because I'm slow/confused/sleepy)
- Leave the conversation if I can, especially for transient informal gatherings. 

I often don't feel in a position to stop or question these people, so they can still say whatever they want. But I can also laugh (or sometimes leave) whenever I want. This gives me that tiny feeling of liberty and keeps me sane. Everyone else: How do you stay sane?

The people who like to take Instagram of their coffee and always say “i love coffee!!!” Or “can’t live without coffee” always drink only 1 cup of coffee. They don’t drink much coffee, but call themselves “coffee lovers”. 

On the contrary, the real people who are drinking 5 cups of coffee a day like their lives depended on coffee, don’t call themselves “coffee lovers” and they don’t even even post their coffee online. 

With the same $7, the “coffee lovers” consume ONE cup of overpriced fancy coffee and stop.  The real ones who are really attracted to coffee take the same $7 and buy 5 cups of kopi Beng and drink them all.....

Also, the people who are so enthusiastic about going to try new cafes and restaurants are, ironically, the same people who have small appetites. They move away from the food by pushing half the plate away: they don’t even finish eating. 

And just like coffee, the people who never Google cafes, and never say “I love food so much!”, all have large appetites and finish the leftovers REJECTED by “food lovers”. 

Who are the ones who reject and push food away? “Food lovers”. Who are the ones who reject and push coffee away? “Coffee lovers”. 

Who are the ones who don’t consume much of coffee and food? The ones who “love” them!

To girls: You aren't entitled squat. Stop thinking a guy owes you a meal or gifts, even if they have the means to do so. It's his money, he can do what he likes with it. If you want money for your time you spend, go get a job. If you specifically want money from guys, go into prostitution.

This isn't anything to do with the gender wage gap debate. This is basic manners, and common sense. The same would hold true if the genders were reversed i.e. guy's aren't entitled to girl's money, and girl's should be able to spend on their boyfriend's within their limits.

If y'all aren't like this, it doesn't apply to you.

Their only focus is on our CAP. If you want to apply for an academic programme/specialisation you are really passionate about, they look at CAP.  I don't think they realise that they should start looking beyond CAP. As an university student currently, i worry if employers will not look beyond CAP. Any suggestions for this?

I was quite saddened by all the recent saga. I came from a not very well to do family and is not very smart. Had to retake A levels just to get into NUS . The amount of mental breakdowns I have received just to enter NUS has significantly affected my outlook on life greatly. 

Looking back at how much I had sacrificed in the past just to enter a school that is tainted by all the scands really hurts me a lot. It seems like all my hardwork has been cancelled off like what have I been doing with my life? I could have pursued my passion. 

I thought people who lives in Hall had more school pride? What happen to all the pride from entering NUS? Those non NUS people...stop being sour just because you you cannot enter a prestigious school! Don't say that you didn't want to enter. If you didn't want to enter in the first place, why would you be reading NUSWhispers?

When will there be gender equality in the world? Let’s wait till one day men can get pregnant and go through labour pain then tell me about gender equality?

Sure, some of you there are gonna say objectively that that is a biological issue and should not be confused with gender equality and going Dutch right. Then, I shall be objective on gender equality. Can you men out there accept that your baby born to include the mothers’ surname too? If you cannot then you aren’t being objective either. If you can accept, you sure your dad and mum can accept?

Then again, some of you will say that is a different story because that’s marriage. But, if you don’t invest, do you think you will get a single return? 

If the girl is reasonable, she will not mind eating cheaper food with you. If you can’t afford high-end restaurant, voice it out. Don’t act like you can afford and then ask for separate bills.

I just wanted to say that if we become so calculative, every thing must be halved equally, then what’s the point of being in a romantic relationship? Just be single then? Or when Husband or Wife meets a financial crisis, just go for a divorce? Since fair ma, everything half-half, so why the need to stay on for each other for the financial crisis?

Even if you are not, why are you so angry at people who prefer virgin and insist they change their attitude? And if i don’t, they will call me sexist, not open minded or oppressing female sexuality.

My roommate is really one of a kind. Looked like a decent human being from the outside, sounded polite and demure but you get to see her true self after living together for a semester. Selfish, self-entitled, oblivious just to name a few. Can you imagine someone who splurges their parents' money like their own in Singapore, but bickers with you over pennies and cents overseas, using their parents as an excuse? Hypocrite indeed. Saving on necessities such as a public transport pass only to splurge it on high-end cafes and michelin-starred restaurants.

1268,"Hi, I’m the OP of #63161. Thanks for leaving your comments. My friend and I met up and talked it through. Maybe I should have set some context. My friend and I are both gay, we have no romantic feelings for the other (as far as I know) and are just merely best friends. I apologised to him for using that language. Then, I sought for clarification on why he thinks I’m not a good friend. Again, he brought up the same two reasons: I don’t text him first and I am not often the one who initiates the plan to meet up with him. He said that he feels anxious when people don’t reply him and he doesn’t quite know how to follow-up in the event that I don’t respond to his messages. I am aware he’s dealing with anxiety issues and to that point, I said that I would be fine if he wanted to prompt me for a reply. I would not feel imposed.

When he was finished with his part, I explained to him why I reacted in such a manner and why I thought his words were unfair. On the first reason, I told him that I am not the sort to text or respond immediately. I look at the urgency of a message, and I respond accordingly. Sometimes that takes a few hours; other times, I reply immediately. In every instance I’ve responded to him, I’ve replied enthusiastically. I don’t write monosyllable answers. I take time to craft a thoughtful response complete with emojis and gifs. He felt that I responded too slowly; to that point, I agreed but said that that is not something I will change or give in to him. I emphasised that if it was something urgent, he can call me directly and I will make the time for him. 

On the second reason, I agreed that I could take more initiative to plan meetups with him. I confessed to sometimes relying on him to plan things for us.  This is something I will work on. Everything is well now between me and my friend. 

Final point, I wanted to respond to a comment left in my earlier confession. Someone said that a person who doesn’t care about texts they get is not someone worth showing respect. I wonder how the hell you would have survived in an age prior to any forms of messaging technologies. I completely disagree with you and think it’s utter bullshit to expect someone to respond to texts they get. I don’t live my life on my phone. So if I think your message is non-urgent and you are not my close friend, I sure as hell am not going to respond to you. We like to think we’re the centre of the universe in our friends’ lives, but that’s not the case and it shouldn’t be. If you want your friend’s attention, text/call and ask him or her for a meetup. Catch up over a meal or coffee. The best conversations are done face-to-face and not over texts. But you know what? You do you. I'll do me.

To Megan, your comment was the most helpful. You reminded me to approach the subject gently; because I know my friend is going through anxiety issues and I didn't want to hurt him. Thank you.

I’ve been there at his shittiest point in life. And If I didn’t care for him, I wouldn’t even reply to his texts. Yes, I admit I don’t text often. Yes, I admit I respond late. Yes, I admit he initiates more plans than I do. 

But guess what? No matter how tired I am, I reply to his texts within either the same or next day. I make time to attend as many meetups he plans either with me privately or with our mutual friends (some of whom I don't even like being around). When I go out for drinks with some other friends he doesn't know, I invite him. When we plan for lunch, sometimes I make my way to his school (which is not in NUS, btw) because I know his class schedule is a lot more hectic than mine. What the fuck more does he want? 

Yes, I can text him more or initiate plans with him, but why the fuck is he measuring the quality of our friendship by the frequency of my texts or the number of times I initiate meetups?!?! I’ll text him tomorrow when I’m over it, but ugh, fucking hate it when people behave like this.

Because of this, we have numerous disagreements and she said I appear too quiet, low profile and invisible among people and it is not good for my image. I really feel it's unfair as I have never asked her to change any part of her personality.

I don't get why government agencies must be so fucking opaque with their hiring procedures. I'm a fresh grad, just applied to MOE to teach Secondary-level History, got interviewed last month. Spent the whole time waiting for an answer from them, at the same time going for other interviews with private companies and organisations. Most of them blanched when they asked me if I had any other job interviews going on and I told them yes I'm waiting on MOE for a reply; I can only assume it's because they know how badly HR at government organisations will drag their feet with replies and that directly impacts on my ability to immediately commit to their job without waiting for MOE to reply me and offer me a job.

So one whole fucking month gone. Wasted. Six interviews last month including MOE, only 2 other than MOE are still pending replies, and they were held in the last week of April so there's still time. And today afternoon I wake up to the email from MOE.

""We refer to your application for a teaching position.

Thank you for your interest in teaching, and the time you had taken to be at the interview.  After careful consideration of your application in totality and in competition with the other applicants, we would like to inform you that your application is unsuccessful.

We wish you every success in your future endeavours.""

Not even a ""not successful now but we'll KIV you for future job offers"" as I know government agencies are prone to doing sometimes. But a straight up ""no we don't want you, don't bother applying again"" reply from their HR. I just wasted one whole month and a bit hoping and wanting to work as a teacher in MOE for my longterm career. All killed off with just one email. No reason, no accountability, no do-overs, no explanations. Nothing. Why are applicants deemed to be unable to handle whatever reason it was that they failed their job applications? How do you expect us to improve or feel that we've been fairly assessed and treated when we don't know what sort of benchmark you people at government HR sections judge us with?

I'm beyond being angry. I'm just crushed. I never wanted to be a teacher initially. But my high school form teacher and English teacher were such inspirations and mentors to me that eleven years on after I graduated and left my school, I wanted to be a teacher just like them and work alongside them. And now it's all gone. Dusted. May as well have been Thanos snapping his fingers on my longterm career prospects.

Just feel like shit now. Not even enough to be truly angry, just crushed and helpless. I don't have a fallback job to just be working at now either. How many more days do I have to add to my career gap before I get lucky?

May 9 was my enlistment date eight years ago. Now May 9 is going to be remembered for something even more bitter than that.

This bitch who is appearing so frequently on his stories these days is a snake (from a certain country I shall not name) who intentionally came into their relationship despite knowing he was already in a committed relationship. The typical third-party mentality, if he's not married he is still available? Bullshit.

After realising his 'feelings' for the snake, he broke up with my friend recently during their supposed romantic getaway where she flew across the globe to meet him. 

My friend and this asshole never felt the need to publicise their relationship extensively on social media so only a few mutuals know they were dating before (so steady, so stable that I was geniunely waiting for their wedding invite until this happened), how she was cheated on horribly, and how she was left with no other alternative except to agree to the break up and left helpless in a foreign country. 

To him, she was just a phase in his life. 
Recalling my friend's words about how he told her during the breakup that this is ""part and parcel of life"" makes my blood boil.

I can't help to wonder if he ever felt guilty about what he did to her, if he was conscious that what he did is considered cheating and what the snake did is morally inacceptable. 
It seems like he is treating the relationship with my friend as something that never happened too.

Cheating is far too normalised that its infuriating.

I've been noticing that I get ticked off/triggered by tiny things. Minor things which i believe normal people shouldn't be triggered by.

When i'm in a good mood, i'd do anything for my family and close friends. It's all laughter and smiles. Everything's perfect. Normal.

But for some minor reason or another, when i get angry, everything just changes. I cant seem to mask my emotions around my family/friends when it comes to anger and annoyance, yet i'm able to do it around acquaintances amd strangers. My conversation tone changes. I start becoming cold and distant for that period.
Why is this?

And i loathe myself for that. The very people who have raised me, who have loved me unconditionally, and here I am getting furious at them over simple matters. I despise myself for having this attitude, and sometimes just wish i'd rather be alone than subject my family to this kind of treatment.

Every night without fail i keep pondering over it and i cant seem to find a solution. 
I'm now fearful of starting a relationship. If i get so easily angered by my family, what right do i have to bring in another person into my life, for fear of getting easily angered once she becomes family as well. Nobody deserves that IMO.

1294,"Hello guys, your senior here. I graduated in 2015 with a pass degree. If i recall correctly, my CAP was around 2.5x. 

Tanking the bell curve was the norm. Contrary to what most people think, i actually had fond memories of NUS. I attended more than 90% of my classes, had good friends, was in a relationship. I just wasnt good in studying.

Some of you might be thinking of giving up (i.e quit NUS) because your grades are barely enough to keep your head above the water. My advice is, dont. If NUS accepts you, you are good enough to graduate. I know because i had a lot of Cs, couple of Bs and Ds, and less than 5 As (project modules, heh). I fail a mod too.

At a CAP of 2.XX, its not about scoring well anymore. Its about survival. Don’t listen to people who tell you to choose the module that you like.  Fact is, what you like might not be what you are good at. You need to choose modules that will push up your CAP.

For people like us, we need to choose those modules that are easy, has little workload, electives with MCQ final exams or modules with heavy weightage on project work/presentation. Those are the mods are hard to score well, but it also means it is hard to fail. I mean, if that module is project work based with NO final exam, your prof is not gonna fail you and your team.  Most of the time, you are gonna end up with at least a B which will help pull up your D or C.

Of cos, don’t be a free loader for project work. You don’t need to spend so much hours on the project like a first class, but doing your fair share is good enough.

I had times when I felt NUS was really tough and the stress was really unbearable. But I know crying or giving up will not solve the problem. My parents are not educated and I had 3 other younger siblings. My dad works 7 days a week for years, resting only during CNY. So I know giving up is not an option. 

Looking back, I remembered the tough times and good times. And I am glad I come out of it mentally stronger and most importantly, I survived NUS even though many a times, I felt like a goldfish trying to climb a tree.

Remember, if you are good enough to enter NUS, you are good enough to graduate. Good luck and i see you at the end of the rainbow!

One of them has a habit of asking around to find out who's going where on SEP, and replies ""oh, you're going there? I'm going NOC silicon valley"" *pause for effect*. It's very obvious that he's fishing for compliments, and when the other person goes ""oh...nice"" he looks damn put out by the response. He then goes on to ramble about all the ~entrepreneurial spirit~ and *industry connections* he's going to get on NOC and asks what the other person will get from their exchange. God help those who say they're not going on exchange.

The other one has a habit of bringing up startups and entrepreneurship into literally every conversation. Like even in a convo about what to have for lunch he'll start talking about new ideas for ""disrupting"" the f&b industry when really all he's disrupting is our discussion. Also he has become extremely shameless about asking CS kids to work with, or rather for him on his many many app ideas for free (he's from Biz). He talks a big game about how we'll all strike it rich if his app idea takes off but knows absolutely nothing about app development.

Whenever I saw the internship emails from the school, they are always looking for skillsets in these web or mobile or analytic areas. I look at the stuff CS teaches and none of them fit into any of these roles.

Granted, I understand that at the core, CS teaches fundamental knowledge to pursue deep and technical areas, and does not simply prepare one for development jobs that one can learn on the web anyway. Still, at least, little of what job titles are looking for at fresh graduate level are taught in the CS courses.

I've always found that a lot of CS theory (or at least how it's taught in the modules) play hard and fast with the mathematics involved. It's honestly kind of aggravating, especially when it's evident that the profs gloss over parts that they themselves don't seem too clear on. This is especially bad when some of the “proofs” the CS profs give rely on the abuse of notation or terms used..

This also seems to play into how CS modules seem kind of unstructured, especially (at least, to me since I take CS and Math modules side-by-side) how they’re taught; a typical Math topic has examples designed to illustrate a particular facet or consequence of a theorem or problem, whereas all the CS topics I’ve taken seem to involve logical leaps that the profs just kind of gloss over (or outright admit that we somehow “have” to make the leap).

Part of this is also me just ranting about how CS just doesn’t seem to have its shit together compared to the Math department; I’ve never had a Math prof be unable to answer a question, whereas I’ve had that multiple times. I’ve also never had a Math prof abuse notation or specific terms as badly as some of the CS profs I’ve had. Does anyone else feel this way?

I keep getting Ds and Fs. The one time I decided to give up on all the other modules and channel all my efforts into just one, I managed to force it up to a C minus--a very bittersweet moment for me.

1324,"Recently, NUS geography sent a “reassurance” email regarding the departure of several geography professors. Honestly not sure how I feel about this but surely, I don’t feel “so good” (or “assured”). I believe many of the Geography majors are also aware that this does not bring any good news or comfort. Some of our beloved and favourite professors are leaving NUS for good and we are deeply saddened. While it is clearly for the advancement in their careers, I am curious as to their motivations in leaving the institute and role of the university/department in any attempts to retain our best talents and professors. It feels like someone (“Thanos” maybe) just snapped and wiped them out. How can a department in the top 10 global ranking experience such drastic changes? 

Clearly, with the situation in the departmental office, there is bound to have some repercussions on the learning experience and opportunities (modules, research projects and HT) for students. No form of “assurance” is enough until we see the “promised” changes. Already, less and less modules are available for students over the year. Just look at the modules previously listed on the Geography department webpage and as a geography student you will already know that some of them are no longer offered. In addition, this also means that more students are competing for the remaining modules available whether by choice or not. Inevitably, this also have effects on class size and learning environments. Before taking a level-4000 module, I always thought that the classes will be different and more seminar-style like sessions similar to some of the higher level classes I have been on for exchange. However, I was easily proven wrong and the sheer size of the classes just meant that conducive learning environments for open discussions is difficult. 

Any students who have to face the fact that their department is losing some of their best professors will surely be saddened and disappointed. Maybe... “Some people move on, but not us”. These beloved professors will continue to hold a place in our hearts.

So much has be done more than promised. Nonetheless, going forward, existing and new incoming professors assembled by the department have to do whatever it takes to continue to maintain the standards and legacy set by the leaving professors. This is by no means an easy feat and I sincerely hope the best for the department.

My current GF actually approached me and things developed from there. The funny thing is... I got to know some of these female crushes I had before on better terms through projects, classes and stuff and a few of them confessed that they had a crush on me before and regretted not chasing me back when I was single. 

I don't get it, it's the 21st century and people regardless of gender should not live under the preconceived notion that guys should always make the first move. So instead of asking SoC guys to do better, why not everyone just make a point to approach the guy or girl you are interested to know/date before it is too late for regrets?

Her interesting take on how history should be taught and viewed inspired me to want to continue taking History as a Major. 

For example, every tutorial in the semester we look at history in a different way/source. One tutorial we did debates between confucian scholars and government officials, understanding the dynamic relationship between the clergy and the scholars. In another tutorial we looked at a famous scroll painting which depicted life in Tang China and examined how we can better understand history via these lenses. 

Her modes of assessments are also very interesting and contribute greatly to my understanding of the subject. For instance we have an Individual Passion Project that we are allowed to creatively (in whatever way we wish to) express our understanding. Ive seen some of my peers even do imperial chinese history memes for the project, some wrote poems, some even designed games and infographics! We also had a group project that forced us to work together to present a SKIT in class! Among all the group projects I had this semester I think this was the most fun preparing for and performing in!

The best part about Dr Wang is that she never fails to relate what we do (assessments, tutorials etc) to how we can better view, learn and appreciate history. Through her classes I not only better appreciate History, but also the pedagogical approaches to the teaching of the subject. I believe that all classes should be as fun as and as educational as hers! Fellow students past and present of Dr Wang's classes, what do you think?

p.s. yes, I have also submitted my module feedback to commend her on this.

1350,"With regards to the recent saga, it's funny how there's a group of people who are bashing NUS for their personal motives. There's either that person who says that it is lucky that he/she didn't go to the school or that he/she will no longer plan to go to the school in the future. Hmm are they trying to justify that it is not that they could not attend the school but that they didn't want to? I wonder what's the point in doing so. And then there's that other person who just keep criticising or mocking the school without giving any useful comments. I can't deny that I'm particularly annoyed by these people because I'm a student from NUS. I just can't understand why these people have to capitalise on this opportunity to fulfil their own unhappiness against the school oops.

1351,"Can somebody enlighten me on the thought processes behind people who comments on the Straits Times articles? NUS President apologises: ""He should step down!"",  ""NUS is a disgrace!"", ""Too late for apology!"". How are your comments of any use? If you believe in helping the victim, why don't you give some constructive comments? I believe that the school's current disciplinary measures are less than satisfactory but right now, shouldn't we take a step back and give them a chance to work on it? To be honest, there are probably many other institutions who are lacking in this aspect as well. Instead of constantly picking on what NUS did wrong, why don't these people start looking at it from an overall viewpoint and give some useful suggestions so that we can improve the situation in Singapore?

1352,"Hi all, so with all the hype regarding the recent saga surrounding the issue of misconduct, I've decided to jump onto the bandwagon and just share my two cents worth on this issue.

First, it's reading week with finals just round the corner. So, guys, please be the good university students you're supposed to be (or at least everyone else thinks so) and start studying your entire semester's worth of course materials within these last few days. You don't want to find yourself in the position where you are sitting in the exam hall, staring at the question paper and feeling the sudden, irrepressible urge to peep at those around you (especially at those that may catch your eyes). You are liable for your own actions as adults.

Second, if/when caught, as (hopefully) mature adults, please accept the punishment meted out with dignity. Please don't start putting the blame onto the deanery or any other bodies that is/are responsible for investigating the event and meting out the appropriate punishments. While some may argue that the punishments are inadequate, there are those who would think otherwise. Honestly, it is just impossible to please everyone.

Third, please stop victim- and/or perp-shaming, saying that it's his/her fault that made you wanna peep or that they are trying to gain fame through shame. With all due respect, you could have avoided this if you had just done what you're supposed to do - be a good university student. 

So yeah, with that, I wish you all the best in the upcoming finals.

Cheers.

TDLR; Just don't cheat in every sense of the word.

1353,"I'm from Eusoff hall and i think one of the reasons why this saga occured is because people are too comfortable with each other. Even though there are toilets dedicated to men and women separately, many residents just treat it like a shared toilet because we are 'eusoff family'. I admit, i've been what they call a hall phantom so i never really fit in with anyone. As a female, it's still quite uncomfortable for me to share toilets with a male. The guys and the more popular girls seemed okay with this though. As a hall phantom with no voice, it is hard to voice out the problem. If guys can freely walk in and out of female toilets like it's a normal thing, it's obviously easier for this sort of peeping thing to occur. It's easy to say that it's the guy's fault, don't blame the system... but then again, this sort of carefree system is what makes it easy for them to do what they do in the first place.

I’ve heard stories of them rejecting people just because they don’t have a government bond or have been PRs for several years. NUS brands itself as a very diverse and inclusive institution but is one of its major programmes diverse and inclusive? I know that they think international students will just go away and find a job in the NOC country, but honestly I’ve heard more of Singaporeans doing that. Also, international students literally cannot apply to any NOC scholarship. I understand why several Government scholarships require you to be a citizen or a PR but these scholarships are administered by NUS, so why are international students not eligible? I feel NUS has done a good job of establishing a diverse and inclusive environment but NOC definitely needs to be a bit more transparent and accommodating!

1356,"I'm a woman and I feel sorry for the Nicholas guy in the Monica Baey saga. Don't get me wrong - I'm not affiliated with Nicholas in anyway, nor do I think what Monica did was wrong or attention seeking or all those things the (horrible) (male) commenters are saying (everytime I read these kind of comments I feel sick). I just think that the perpetrator's current fate - having his face plastered all over the Internet with his army details and IC details and job details, even his (innocent?) girlfriend's face open for everyone to see - is a fate much much worse than if he had suspended longer, expelled, or even sentenced to jail for the what the 1 week that offenders usually seem to get. The system might be too lax for offenders, and that is something that the new Penal Code is already changing and NUS should also work towards, but his current situation is more akin to a public stoning. What more of his girlfriend, his family and his friends' who didn't do anything and now can no longer show their faces in public. The purpose of a jail term, or other sanctions, is to appropriately punish the offender, but then also to rehabilitate him and for him to change and move on with his life. If he doesn't change, then the system (is supposed to) punish him again. 

I blame NUS and the police force for this. If they had just handled the situation properly in the first place, it would not be such a fiasco as it stands now. If a 1 term suspension and a warning is the standard precedent for such first time offenders, they should have at least communicated this to Monica and the school, or have the guidelines and disciplinary committee procedure online for everyone to read. Taking Monica's word for it, they did not bother to involve the victim in the process at all or care about her welfare. And they should have provided avenues for Monica and other members of the community to feedback if anyone felt measures were not sufficiently taken, instead of forcing her to engage in this witch hunt just to get any answers at all. Nicholas committed an offence, a crime even - but ultimately his lame apology letter and one semester suspension was just what the school asked him to do, and the lack of police prosecution. He is being crucified not just for his crime, but for the problems of the entire system. 

The heart of the problem is NUS's - and perhaps Singapore's - culture of paternalism and arrogance. The authority always knows best, there is no transparency or opportunity for feedback or change, so much so that they don't bother about keeping the victim informed of what is happening - one email only?? How is that right - - or give the victim and the school community options to feedback for change. Its about keeping everything under wraps, saving face, and not telling anyone anything because students are stupid and don't know any better than school admin. And this is evidenced by their first statement about this matter ""we will convene a committee and get back to you next academic year""? There's not even an attempt to bother to address the public's concern. I'm willing to give NUS the benefit of the doubt that some investigation and disciplinary procedures are in place and were carried out, even if they may not be ideal. If they had just come out to share this, then the next issue is moving to improve these systems, rather than the state and flak they're receiving now. 

Serves NUS right that it all is blowing up in their face. Pity for Nicholas that he is nothing more than a scapegoat for the system's incompetence.

1357,"Regarding the recent peeping tom incident. Here's an interesting observation: most netizens agree that the sentence should be harsher, but few dare state how much harsher they think it should be.

This is pretty important (think about it).

Suppose the fair sentence is marginally greater than the actual sentence, for example 24 months warning/probation versus the actual 12 months. Then it is quite possible that current social justice efforts are overdone.

Clearly there is an upper bound for harsh sentencing. I don't think it is fair to impose the death sentence or lifetime imprisonment for the culprit, for example.

Finally, it is only mature and morally correct to state one's ""price"" in a negotiation. This only needs to be done based one's best ability (e.g. a range/interval might be sufficient). In this case, an upper bound for the culprits sentence.

Otherwise you'd most likely end up in a trap (despite good intentions), where you are either: never satisfied, or just another cry baby seeking maximum revenge.

After my shower, I thought she would already have left by then, so I only wrapped a towel around my waist and walked back to my room. I went back I was shocked to see her still there. I immediately tried to cover up but she smiled, grabbed my crotch and pulled the towel off. She giggled and spank my ass, then she just winked at me and left.

I was so scared, I wanted to cry. Kind of afraid to tell my hall masters considering I am a guy. That night I went to sleep full of fear and emotion, it was such a traumatizing experience...

Every day since then I would wake up and sit in my corner of my room and cry.

I want to personally thank you for being so courageous and stepping up to shed light on the situation and how it was handled by the police and NUS. I have read a few comments that are trying to vilify the VICTIM for going public with this case. And it’s comments like these that make it so hard for so many women to come forward following sexual harassment/assaults. Somehow after everything you have already been through people try to justify the perpetrators actions and that is complete BS. They try to take your voice and place blame on you for sharing, and that is absolutely WRONG! 

Luckily most of these demented victim shaming comments are met with many other moral responses condemning the perpetrator and those defending him. 

This must be such a difficult time for you to have to relive the event and experience unwarranted backlash for your willingness to speak up for yourself and challenge a broken system that fails to bring you APPROPRIATE justice as well as REAL action to change the way things are handled in the future cases.

From the bottom of my heart, I thank you. Thank you for your voice, thank you for your courage, and thank you for not giving up and accepting such a lackluster response from the police and the school.

I stand with you Monica. Thank you!!

1360,"Er yeah would just like to give my opinion on the whole Baey issue. I think the real issue is that the punishment meted out and the expectation for punishment is different, leading to some kind of injustice felt by Monica and consequently the general public. While we should assume that the related institutions have worked SUFFICIENTLY (in their own understanding) to analyze this issue, that is not to say that these institutions have done ENOUGH (in the eyes of the public) to pursue this matter. That being said, as the laymen (i.e. general public) have no understanding of the logic behind the punishment that was meted out nor the actual ""who's in charge of this situation"", perhaps it would be better for the institutions themselves to come out and make things clearer for everyone. While this may not be sufficient, it would be a good first step towards resolving the issue.

Also, I wouldn't condone witch-hunting, but the fact that this sort of vigilantism and retributive justice is rampant just reflects the larger social issue: that many (or maybe a small but vocal group? But judging by the support this is gaining I'd go with larger group) of the public have lost confidence in the system to be taking matters into their own hands. Maybe the institutions should be working towards restoring this ""loss of trust"" instead of merely telling everyone that ""WiTcH HuNtS aRe BaD"" because everyone knows that anyway, they do it because they empathize with the injustice felt.

tl;dr Bigger issues at hand that needs to be resolved before these issues can be put to rest.

Maybe the punishment has always been just suspension from studies for a period of time, that's why people felt that its worth the risk to carry out this atrocious act while being a full-time undergraduate? 
Stop blaming Monica, she must have been very desperate to do this on a social media as mentioned that the authorities have all turned a blind eye on her. It takes a lot of courage expose oneself to the public. Also, let's hope that Nicholas is really repenting on his actions while being suspended, maybe doing some volunteering work or charity, and not doing internship at some reputable company to build up his portfolio as I seen on the internet.

I myself have diabetes due to family history, 5 years ago i was nearly blind due to my condition and i didn't gave up and change my lifestyle such as going gym, research and eating healthy, then i able to fight through and from 80kg to 63kg currently, no more medication required as i control my sugar intake very strictly and i even went to take up a personal trainer certificate and help others ppl facing problem like me last time. 

I have lots of scar on me and not really good looking, i have tried many ways to know new girls such as tinder or etc... for the past 3 years i have tried quite hard in searching my partners but never got one, i gave up last year on using such app as i got hurt really bad from many ppl in the app, i have tried 2 ways, one is telling the truth in my profile of my illness and 2nd is not telling them, my friend advice me not to tell first and try to know girls first and then slowly tell them the truth. but in my heart i felt bad for not telling but yet i tried my friend advice, so.... after some of the girls that i manage to stay in touch in the app and continue chatting, i told them about my illness and family background, they straight away not talking to me anymore. But some yes, they did replied me and they sort of tell me they are just looking for friends to tell in a way to reject me, some even told me (Why would i choose a unhealthy one where i can find a healthy and good looking one) this is where i got hurt that bad and gave up. 

Recently i had a trip with my company colleagues, there's a girl actually i interested in but i know she got attached recently and therefore i tried not to go near her although i felt a connection, i told myself again the reality i am facing, why would she want to be with me even she is not attached. I am not tall, handsome nor well live off, with illness and probably can't have child due to my illness that had made me very low sperm count and also i don't want to pass down my illness to my spouse although i wish to have a family. I am really sad but i can't achieve anything as simple as a relationship. 

In my life i only had 1 relationship where i did not turn out well, i really do love my partners if i still able to find some one i like and of course she like me too (even she does not), i will always try my best for her.

Despite that, perhaps she might have done the right thing. From this, we can come to one common conclusion: this lady has exposed how NUS treat  important matter concerning students and its welfare with such leniency. How to place trust in NUS' governing body when they could not provide us students with the security that we need to live our student life with peace of mind, be it in and out of hall?

My assumption is that NUS knows no matter what, as students we wouldn't even think of dropping out of NUS even when our rights are violated because we see value in the precious paper they brand us with. A simple hush-hush was enough to sweep the matter under the rug, thinking student's life will just go on as we grind and mug, drowning in paper chase.

I just want people to respect the police/legal system and not take matters into their own hands.

If u think there's a problem with the system, challenge with the system in the right way without harming others. 

Yes, she-who-will-not-be-named was traumatized by he-who-will-not-be-named. But that doesn't justify her destroying his life. When did we forget the saying, ""An eye for an eye make the whole world blind.""? How we are treat others is a reflection of ourself, how other people treat us should not affect that. 

To all those who accept her actions and told me to consider if she was my mother or girlfriend or sister or daughter. The answer I give u is the same I will not condone her actions of revealing the perpetrator and dealing her own form of punishment in the form of doxxing even if it's my relative or close friend who is the victim.

To those saying this is victim blaming, this is not victim blaming. Victim blaming is this: ""She should not have bathe in Hall, she is just asking for it, I mean it's well known that there are peeping Toms in NUS Halls."" 

How about you guys consider if he was your father or son or brother or boyfriend. Yes I will hate, despise him for his actions but I will be happy for him that he got lucky, that the system let him off easy, gave him a second chance.

1372,"My two cents worth in response to the Monica Baey incident. I don't think NUS doesn't care about the safety of its students. I was personally involved in catching one guy filming in one of the toilet. Here's the story: 
I went to the toilet and a group of girls were muttering among themselves looking panicky. I asked what happened and one of them told me she was filmed by a peeping tom using his handphone in the toilet from the other cubicle and suspected the peeping tom was just sitting at the lobby area near the toilet as she could recognize the hp cover. I immediately took the victim to report to the campus security  while asking the other girls to keep watch not to let  guy leave. The security followed us back to the incident location immediately.  Upon seeing the security, the guy tried to run away and security gave chase. After confronting the guy and looking into his hp photo collection but couldn't find the actual footage, security called the police. This happened on a Saturday. The chief campus security investigator dropped what he was doing outside and came back immediately (he explained this as he was dressed in T-shirt, shorts and slippers as if looking rather unprofessional). The police came and took the guy away. When i asked what's going to happen to the guy, campus security said as this was a criminal case, they have to let the police handle it. Btw this happened in a rather public area of nus. 

For those who are still condemning Nus about the Monica case, I'm not sure if you are targeting the right board! Nus is not the police. What's been handled to the police stays with the police.  Nus is here to educate people. By condeming nus for allowing this peeping to be back studying,  does it mean also that education institution should not allow any ex-criminals to be enrolled? So much talking about giving ex-criminals a 2nd chance, how is that possible without first embracing the chance to education?

1374,"Massive uncalled for TLDR post aka /when procrastination strikes/: Some thoughts on the recent controversy. 

Was the campaign demanding change manipulative? Yes it was. As are many successful campaigns. Purposed narratives were fed to you through your feeds, accompanied with powerful calls to action and immense social pressure to support the cause. The best narratives (factually accurate or not) are always presented in the way which helps the writer's cause most. So, in that sense, a lot of manipulation went down. Your emotions and sentiments were skilfully managed by content creators. 

And the numbers tell. It was a well-executed, effective campaign. 

But that's not necessarily a bad thing, and charges of manipulation on the part of the campaign starters merely distract from larger concerns now illuminated by the controversy. So do debates on their personal agenda and possible revengeful motives. To put this simply: if I started a charity seeking to glorify myself, this charity can still be of good to society. Personal and public interests are not always mutually exclusive.

Perhaps more helpful questions to step back and ask are: What is the extent of the problem -- based on reliable facts -- which this cause is concerned with? What good comes out of widespread support for this? What are the potential ramifications? These three factors need to be thought out, and weighed against one another. 

In writing this, my intention is not to favour any side. I hope that we, especially those of us in a position of less emotional attachment than the parties involved, can all go beyond the anger, anxiety, and consternation we feel. These emotions may motivate the burdens we have towards particular groups in the community, towards particular vulnerabilities, or our ability to empathise with various parties. Sure, and that's perfectly normal. 

But they should not reduce our views to mere labels (""victim-blamer"") and tag lines (""doxxing is wrong!"", ""we want change!"", ""blame the police not NUS""), much worse labels sitting on polarised extremes.This is a complex, multi-faceted issue. There are many things that need consideration, and many interests at stake. Sure, this situation is symptomatic of some systemic fault, and we want some kind of change; but to what extent, at what cost, and by what means? 

For voices to be heard, they need to ride on the momentum of mass support, and mass support works best with loud, catchy tag lines. I get that. But now that they've have been heard, I hope that we'll stop using our voices as passionate, well-intentioned instruments that drown out other frequencies, but instead carefully wield them as tools.  

TLDR: Let's have more productive, informed dialogues -- in which we present our views with all their warranted nuances.

So his suspension from NUS is not any loss to him because he’s ultimately boosting his resume out there with work experience. I still see many people saying the one semester suspension is a good enough punishment which I doubt so. If the victim never voiced out what happened, he will be happily moving on with his life with almost no implications for his wrong doings. Also those against the victim because she seems to be taking “revenge” rather than seeking for justice, let’s remember that it would’ve taken so much courage to voice out the truth and she did not do it knowing it’ll get so much attention. At this point this whole issue is blown out of proportion. The fact that authorities have said to step up and take more actions/review the current policies is a good outcome everyone should be happy about moving forward.

1384,"Regarding this Monica bay scenario:

1. The guy was caught, the police was involved, the guy was let off with a warning  because it was his 1st time getting caught. Just because she can't accept the outcome doesn't mean she is justified to go full SJW. She say it's unfair for her but how is this fair for the perpetrator? She is literally demonizing this guy. All we know about the guy is from her side and some people are talking about suspending/expelling/jailing him. He might have problems in his life, stress etc leading to the peeping not that it justify his peeping. BUT THE UNIVERSITY AND THE POLICE has taken both sides' account and based on that, he has been warned and if he is caught again more severe punishment will apply. We don't know this guy in real life, he is only 20-22? but we are already ruining his life. I would like to ask Monica if he take his own life tmr cos of your SJWing, will u be happy?

2. If we condone Monica's action, we are condoning vigilantism. Punishments meted out by the legal or any system should be all the punishment the perpetrator should be subjected to, any punishment beyond that including social bullying like what Monica is doing now should be illegal.

3. Monica is unhappy with the result of the system. she can sound off and gather people who experienced the same thing, petition the system for change, SJW about it sure no problem. There was never a need to reveal the perp. Make no mistake she is destroying this guy's life just because she wants to. 

4. Harsher Punishment does equate to lesser crimes. But Criminals don't do crimes cos they can take the punishment, they do it cos they think they can get away with it. Especially crimes like peeping Tom where it happens in secluded area and the whole concept of the crime is not getting caught. So yes there should be harsher punishment but will peeping Tom stop? nope.

This incident was reported months ago, and NUS handled it badly, regardless of whether the punishment was adequate or not.

If you have been following the details closely, NUS has actually punished the boy more than sufficiently by suspending him for 1 sem, giving him an official letter of reprimand, making him go for counselling and rehab and do 30 hours of corrective work. The incident had also been reported to the police, but there was probably insufficient evidence to jail him. This shows that NUS has already done its part, so please stop blaming the school.

Eh dude, firstly I'm sorry you had such a bad experience. You ought to blame yourself for being academically bad. Your failure becomes the world's fault now, for INFLUENCING YOU. 20 over years old and in a university and now you cannot decide what is right or wrong. Still want to be hired in a good company earning good pay?

Seriously who the hell cares about you scoring the best marks in JC and all your ridiculous competitions, volunteers and representation achievements when you scored a 2.88 despite all these. It only shows that you CHOOSE to participate in all the random activities but REFUSE to put in effort in your academics. Since when joining a company don't need to have good results? Besides lousy results, you want to showcase your awesome CCA achievements. Your awesome CCA achievements cannot even justify your technical ability lor. 

You think leadership comes without knowledge one ah? 2.88 want to be a manager earning 4.5k? Wait long long lor please, this is sinkapore. You want to earn 4.5k? Be a sales engineer and chiong lor. This field you need to chiong and hustle to earn the big bucks since you don't have the knowledge.

Sorry lor you don't have the white horse life where you can kiao ka and enjoy in the family business. Then all the worst you have to work hard right?

Eh please la the bunch of you really writing out of context to shame that OP. You want good pay good life then you study hard and be good in your studies first. If you score badly, you will definitely be filtered out. But once you enter the workplace it is a whole new ball game.

1394,"Noticed that netizens are upset with NUS’s handling of the recent Nicholas Lim/Monica Baey saga. But why ain’t people angry at how the police handled it too? Shouldn’t the police also be made to clarify their stance? I’m sure there are a few news report of people committing similar crimes and actually have been given an actual criminal record, with legit punishment). In this case, the police only gave him a conditional warning, which basically means nothing. And this is when there are evidences of him filming a naked lady showering?!

I have been a victim of upskirt photo/video before. I only had a few hours of sleep before the incident and hence I led my guard down; it didn’t come across to me that it doesn’t quite make sense for somebody to stand close behind me on an escalator during off-peak hours. I was maybe 15 seconds late in sensing something was wrong and when I looked behind me, the prepetrator have already been using his phone on me. FYI my dress length was below my knee so don’t victim-blame me. I confronted him while we were still on the escalator and proceeded to singlehandedly nab him after he denied my accusation yet refused to let me check his phone, which was in camera mode and he gave ran. There was CCTVs around that filmed the whole incident, multiple witnesses of the public and police when they saw me fighting against the man. Despite all of these, the police told me that I’ve already gotten the best deal possible since they’re deporting him (that man is a foreigner on visiting pass) because they only found photos/videos of my upskirt i.e. first offence. I felt that it wasn’t a heavy-enough punishment, as he could have at least been jailed for a few weeks before getting deported? Especially when there are concrete evidences and the actual victim was there to give fresh first-hand recount etc. Yet the police told me to let go of this. Till this day, I’m still very paranoid of taking escalators alone and even just being alone in public.

In this case, the victim had it worse than me (she wasn’t even clothed at all) yet the prepetrator’s punishment was non-existent, which doesn’t make sense at all. I really hope that the police would revise their punishment of Nicholas Lim... As for why I’m writing this here, I’m too chicken to bring this up to public whatsoever. Nobody except my immediate family and boyfriend knows about my upskirt incident and even at that time, my parents blamed me for wearing a dress (despite it being long). I feel ashame that I am a victim for something like that and I’ve been made to feel that it’s my fault by my parents and the police.

But I feel a very slight regret in having supported her. Identifying the guy, along with photos of his friends while asking news publishers to cover her story for revenge just wasn't right. I think this is known as doxxing, which is also a criminal offence. She could have at least censored the faces of his friends and maybe even his identity. She has gotten her revenge now that the perpetrator will never be able to step out in society ever again. kinda having mixed feelzz about this.

NUSSU Exco also recognises, that as opposed to a criminal court, that rehabilitation is an extremely strong principle in how student offenders are treated in the Board of Discipline, given that NUS is an educational institution. NUSSU Exco also notes that the Board of Discipline had acted in accordance with existing precedent and due process, and respects that the decision by the Board was arrived at in good faith.""

1397,"This is the admin of #61703 replying to Mr. BTech who is ""not replying indefinitely"".

If you still do not see the point that I am putting across, assuming that I am a ""emotional teenager"", perhaps your inability to comprehend my argument is the exact reason you spur us on by saying ""grades are not important"".

Old man, our studies do not simply comprise of ""regurgitat(ing) knowledge"". Granted, everybody knows the knowledge you learn in school, regardless of level might not be used for your future job or even tertiary education. The chemistry knowledge I learnt in JC definitely isn't fully applicable to the course I'm studying now. What the education system does succeed in however, is fulfilling the purpose of nurturing critical thinkers. The questions I tacked in A Levels set the foundations on how I should study, problems which come out of it and how I should solve it. Just like in uni, where a firm grasp of knowledge on my major would be a good indication that I can critically think in the field and perhaps contribute to the firm I join. 

More importantly, thank you to #61802 for your insight on the topic. I guess it does take a real life example to show people the reality of the situation, and I wish you all the best in your future career. Bottom line, grades do matter for most jobs as the first point of selection. What comes next (e.g. attitude and ability to work in a firm) will be judged AFTER grades were looked at. Typically, the people who say ""grades don't matter"" either really don't need them cos they are secure in their future, or are just trying to throw you off to study less for the bell curve.

A lot of you have commented (esp the guy who said something along the lines of it depends on what you do). I do acknowledge your point, and I did think about it. You are right by saying that everybody has different aspirations. After all, we cannot have a society full of doctors, just like how we cannot have one full of poets. But that brings me to the point I brought up in my original post. However, what mommy told me at the end of the day makes perfect sense; ""it doesn't matter how well you do, as long as you tried your best"". I admit that maybe me and the other guy might have made results sound like a means to an end. Thats not true, we are just saying that the notion of grades not being important is utter rubbish. At the end of the day however, there will always be people who do better than others. To the people who aren't doing well, as long as they have done their best, thats all that matters. To tell them however, that grades aren't important before they have even tried could lull them into a false sense of insecurity. Instead, EVEN IF WE KNOW that they are not at the top of their class, we should still encourage them to work hard, and the end product does not matter as long as they tried their best.

It might seem confusing but let me summarise my argument. 
(1) Grades do matter, I'm sorry but this reality will be here for a long time. 
(2) Grades are not means to an end. TRY YOUR BEST in whatever you do, thats what is important. If your aim is to be a world-class farmer, take a course related to it (hypothetically), and WORK HARD AT IT.

I feel that the true motive of the victim is clear - She wants cold hard revenge and ""fixing the NUS system"" is just a disguise to boost her campaign and garner support for her case against the perpetrator.

Besides, I greatly doubt that NUS would consider any options she is proposing now, given that she did not first seek recourse from higher authorities in NUS, with people that have the power to make decisions, before seeking media coverage. After all, why would they consider her proposals? She knew very well what she was doing would tarnish the school's reputation.

It's like returning a punch in the face to NUS for mishandling the situation and now dictating what NUS should do lol. Does not sound logical to me.

1401,"With the recent sexual assault/peeping tom saga in NUS, I have written this confession to highlight the ancillary issue of defamation which may be lost in the debate. 

Note:  Not legal advice - don't rely on this. These are just my thoughts/opinions, which I hope can give some courage to victims who would otherwise remain silent.

Some victims may be concerned that they may be sued for damages in defamation if they were to speak out about their assault. In my opinion, this is not necessarily the case. 

Briefly stated, civil defamation requires (1) the statement to lower the reputation of the person suing for defamation (i.e. make the person look bad) (2) the statement must refer to the person suing for defamation (3) the statement is communicated to a third party. 

So for example, Cindy gets molested by Andy. If Cindy publishes on Facebook/Insta, ""Andy molested me"", then prima facie, defamation will be found. Of course, your first instinct would be then to say,  ""that's not fair!"", since what Cindy said was true. Your instincts are correct: if the alleged defamatory statement is true, then there is no defamation - this is known as the defence of justification. E.g. I can say ""Trump is a fatass"" because it's true. 

But the defence of justification does not mean that Cindy can just say what she wants, even if she knows it is true. This is because (and this is crucial) she has to convince the court that the statement was true. If Cindy fails to do this (of showing that she was indeed molested), then Cindy will be liable in damages towards Andy even though he did in fact molest her. While this is a repugnant outcome, it may very well happen in many cases if molestation cannot be proven. 

Potentially, to avoid this outcome, my opinion is that Cindy could make a police report first. In the interim period, she could warn her friends about Andy; but she shouldn't be posting anything online. Once the police finds that Andy has molested her, Cindy may post online about Andy's acts towards her. 

On a separate point, damages for defamation depends on, among other things, the reputation of the person being defamed and the reputation of the person defaming. Since everyone is still a student and still a nobody in life, it is in my opinion that damages are unlikely to be that much. So Cindy, even if successfully sued by Andy, may not need to pay as much for defaming Andy, as compared to the damages one would have to pay if a minister was defamed. 

TLDR: To avoid potential liability for defamation, my opinion is that victims should make a police report first, and wait for the perpetrator to be found guilty, before they post anything online. Or just screw it, post it anyway and out that scumbag, since you may just be able to afford the damages for defamation. 

Lawyers/law students/professors, please do help me out if I missed anything.

1402,"This is a reply to Mr. Btech is better than Beng and the whole ""grades don't matter"" debate. Honestly who are you trying to fool? Grades f**king matter in our society, like it or not. Employers sort by honours class and grade first when deciding who to even call for interview.  I agree with that commenter who said that saying these things gives kids the wrong impression. Why? Because I was one of them myself, and I wasn't a kid.

I was a relatively good student out of JC, entering NUS with a >85 rp score. But during my first and second years in hall, I joined up with a group of friends who told me ""grades don't matter, passion does"" everyday. I spent increasing amount of time on my 2 NUS and 6 hall CCAs, volunteering, NUSSU, etc. Predictably my grades suffered for it, and I got a CAP 2.88 at the end of my second year which shocked my parents who always saw me as an above-average student.

Obviously they advised me to study more and quit some of my commitments. But being brainwashed by my friends, who were mostly in the same position, I just said the ""grades don't matter, passion does"" thing back to them. I graduated with a pass degree, and set out into the working world with what I thought was a world-class resume of achievements. To give you a short sample, I represented NUS in 5 inter-varsity competitions in 2 sports, was leader of 2 hall CCAs, organised and carried out 3 overseas volunteering trips, was a NUSSU exco rep, had 4 internships other than the compulsory one, and many more.

Imagine my shock when week after week, companies ghosted me without even telling me that I hadn't been shortlisted for interview. After about a month of this, I started calling back HR departments and asked what happened to my application. Most of the answers were ""your CAP is too low for us to justify giving you an interview"". But what about my long long list of non-academic achievements? ""I'm sorry, your CAP is too low"". These are words that I have heard a dozen times over the phone, verbatim, so don't you dare tell me that employers in Singapore don't care about grades.

I thought that my passion, particularly the internship experience and the organising of overseas trips, would demonstrate my worth to be employed. And I thought that I showed more leadership than almost all graduates with my laundry list of leadership positions. But you know what? None of that matters if the first barrier to hiring is ""what's your honours class"". Every person I know with first class got hired within 2 months of graduation, while I lingered around in my fruitless job search for nearly a year and spiralled into severe depression.

This story doesn't have a happy ending. I eventually got a job, but in a dead-end role (no career progression) and my salary was much lower than my peers. Your first job determines your career, since companies often look at your previous pay when deciding how much to pay you for a new job. I graduated 6 years ago, and I'm consistently earning less than others who got second upper/first class. As for my group of friends? It turns out that most of them are rich, and weren't concerned about finding a job. Some of them are doing charity work now, but most are employed in their family company in various do-nothing roles. I drifted apart from them when I became depressed, and I doubt many of them even think about me any more.

If you've read this far, then thanks for listening to my story. Most of the blame lies squarely on me for not studying harder when I had the opportunity, but I wish that no one had told me that ""grades don't matter"". GRADES DO MATTER, and if you think otherwise you'll end up like me, surfing a university confessions page and wondering about all the things you could have done differently when you were an undergrad. So good luck in your studies, and don't ever fall into the trap of thinking that grades are useless!

PS. Admins pls don't filter, I think that people on this page really need to hear this.

PPS. Also to the OP, I really hate how you always use the fact that you're an employer to talk down to students on this page condescendingly. FYI this is an anonymous page, I can say that I'm the CEO of ST Engineering with 40+ years of experience and refute all your points. But instead I'm just going to offer my life story and let them judge for themselves who is right.

1404,"I would like to share a very meaningful lesson I've seen some time ago, and it resonates more and more with me over time.

You can check it out here, but let me share what I've derived from this below which slightly deviates from his.
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5RBG1PadWI

My Life lessons:
1. Life is inherently meaningless. 

We are biologically coded to go through this cycle of birth, reproduction, death. There is nothing to lose or to gain at the end of the day. As sentient beings with the ability to think (be it logically and illogically), we are pushed into this miserable cycle with no purpose. For those approaching midlife crisis, you'll understand deeply our craving for MEANING. We try to find purpose from the people around us like spouse, children, family, friends, the less fortunate. But I see this as being analogous to two people freezing in an ice land with zero chance of escaping while they just rub each other trying to get some warmth. 

But fortunately we are also biologically coded to feel so damn good when we help others and get appreciated. Everybody's got their own level of thirst for this form of satisfaction, look around for your friends who seem too friendly, too outgoing, too helpful, their thirst is high. If you deprive such people of the appreciation they need, they'll just dive straight into depression, and discover the meaningless of everything.

2. Your happiness lies in other people's hands.

Just like the analogy mentioned previously, ""two people freezing in an ice land"", these 2 people may not find meaning in their death BUT if they spend their last minutes hugging each other out knowing that their warmth will make the other feel better, they will derive happiness and meaning during their time alive. You will find no meaning in rubbing yourself to produce some warmth. However, it is important to note, happiness is derived from the appreciation from others, not purely from your act of kindness. So, in this journey called life with a meaningless end point (death), if you seek meaning of your life, go be nice to people around you. And if you're lucky, some of the people in your life give you the appreciation you need. 

Side track, if you have an insurance friend, you'll see him posting on ig, fb or any other public platforms all the time thanking the people around him, appreciating the people around him. Appreciation is something that can be free coming from you, but priceless for those who receive it. It is an emotional drug that people need to fight the meaningless of life.

So, go out be active in showing appreciation to the people around you. Not everybody has got the fortune to have appreciative friends. Be appreciative to all, the cashiers, the cleaners, the lecturers, everybody. Depression can be found in tears and also the widest smile. You may be saving a life with a smile and thank you.

1405,"This is my thought about the recent incident in Eusoff Hall. 

I felt that NUS has done a poor job if they told the victim to keep quiet. I support her right to demand for change.

However, I disagree that the punishment was too light. I felt that the ban from entering halls were fair, and the school suspension was fair. Apart from that, I might have suggested corrective work order or an academic record. 

 I don't however, support expulsion from school or much more harsher punishments because research suggests that harsher punishments may have counterproductive effects.

The aim is to warn people that such acts are wrong, but someone with the intention to have done it would have done so; I find that assumes like some sort of scale, where x% of people are non-offenders, while y% are ""on-the-fence"" offenders, depending on how severe the punishment is. 

A critique may be that light punishments lead to repeat acts; I believe it was stated that someone who was let off lightly was later arrested for using force. By nipping it in the bud (i.e. arresting him the first time), there would never be a future case.

I disagree here considering 'prison culture'. I'm not sure if prison necessarily helps sexual offenders rehabilitate effectively, given the kind of social interactions they may have with other inmates. Accounts from ex-prisoners suggest that such crimes, and alongside that of fighting, stealing and drug abuse are 'the norm'. I'm not sufficiently convinced that such harsh punishment will bring about the reduction in such cases. Considering that recidivism rates are rather high, sending the offender (in this particular case) to prison would serve as justice but not sufficent in the large scale context- which is to keep us girls safe. 

Furthermore, while desiring justice for the victim, I have seen people abusing/insulting the girlfriends of people who have been accused of such crimes. This is really sad and hypocritical.

I hope the welfare comm can reflect on this and if they decide that they cannot maintain the standards of what a adequate welfare pack should be, they should just do the right thing and request not to provide it for us. It is the right thing to do.

Good for you, you've completed the Assignment 3. As someone who is dying from that assignment for weeks (and it's due tmr wth), I think you're being rather unhelpful. Of course I don't condone sharing the flag directly, but if fellow students are asking for help, at least give them some direction rather than tell them the flag entirely, give them clues in what concepts to think about to approach the questions. Cos the hints given out are not even substantial, it's really difficult to understand what concepts we're supposed to apply.

On the side note, I'm kinda surprised people are complaining more about CS2030 than CS2107 assignments. The latter is terribly awful.

1414,"There's a curious trend of students, mostly girls, getting 'trendy' tattoos such as faces of wolves, maybe some flowers, birds, anchors or 'meaningful' words. Just fyi, getting these generic tattoos don't make you cool, it makes you a generic tryhard. Trying to be different by getting a wolf tattoo to show that you are an independent, strong and cool? Nope! Sad to say, you're just unoriginal and generic. It seems that it is the usual attention seeking girls that gets these tattoos, y'know, the ones that laughs really loudly and claps whenever they laugh. To freshies who are just entering uni, it is easy to succumb to the need to stand out and be a 'cool' person in uni, especially when you're in hall. But think twice before getting a thrashy and random tattoo. A wolf tattoo might make u look cool for a day, but it makes u unoriginal and thrashy your entire life. 'What if there is a meaning to my tattoos?', one might ask. The problem is many don't have a legit reason for getting a tattoo. Many end up trying too hard to justify their tattoos, to the point that it seems pathetic. 'I got through a tough breakup, my wolf/ anchor tattoo is to show that i am strong!' Come on man, it just shows that you're not a person that thinks things through. I'm thinking that many girls with these random generic tattoos are regretting it right now even though they don't show it. So freshies, you can clap and laugh loud and dramatically to show your keeness and support in a topic to get attention, but think twice about getting a useless tattoo because you will most definitely regret it. Once you leave uni and begin work life, you will look back at these now irrelevant girls with those random thrashy tattoos and think to yourself, 'Phew! I'm so glad i ain't them!'

1417,"To add on to the OP of #61673:

I am from Btech, so take my answers with a pinch of salt, or not.

- watered down curriculum 

According to the SCALE website: 

""A module with module code TEExxxx is equivalent to the module EExxxx offered to the full-time students. Subject to the approval from SCALE and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, a student may select a full-time equivalent module in place of any TEExxxx module.""

(http://www.nus.edu.sg/nusbulletin/school-of-continuing-and-lifelong-education/undergraduate-education/btech-engineering/bachelor-of-technology-electronics-engineering/)

Most mods are of TEE and are equivalent to the FT. equivalent. Yes, lecturers might offer some extra hints to the assignments, but structurally, the core of each mod is the same as FT. Anecdotally, I frequently see FT students who missed lectures in the day crash our lectures at night - the content is the same! Look, I've seen lumicast webcasts and close to 90% of the content is the same!

- Btech students have it easy because modules are graded easier

The biggest issues facing BTech students are actually of lack of time to complete assignments + do sufficient revision. 

Here's a typical schedule for BTech students:
8.30am - Wake up and head to work
5.30pm - Leave work for class
6 pm - Reach class, grabbing a subway sandwich along the way (wow it's been the 35th subway you've had this sem). Sit through a whole class on partial differential equations, electromagnetic wave theory, Maxwell equations etc (after a 8 hour work day no less)
9pm - Class ends! Phew, time to make the journey home
10 pm - Reach home and freshen up before going to bed

Repeat for 4 years, at least 3 times a week (including special terms for the first 4 semesters)

It's tough and hence explains the high attrition rate. Almost nobody puts in work day to day, and the bulk of the studying only happens a week prior to finals, where you're playing the catch-up game by then. Don't forget, every lecture is 2.5 hours densely packed with content, and we all know that attention span tapers off quickly after the second hour. Oh yes, tutorials after that too, sometimes past 9 pm. 

If btech mods were graded on the same rigour as FT students, honestly, most Btech students would find it hard to score/pass. FT students can revise with friends (almost impossible for BTech), go to the prof during office hours (sorry bruh at work), and generally have a nice supportive network to push each other higher. Most, if not all, BTech students are fighting this battle themselves, and apart from the occasional weekend study session (a week before the exam, no less), they're alone.

Knowledge in a field is quickly lost once you stop applying it. To those condemning BTech graduates for their supposedly 'lower quality' degree - try out a sample problem set from any of the mods you took in year 1. Can't do it? Think about what would happen when you start working for a year after your degree. Are the supposedly 'inferior quality' of the modules that much of an issue when you can't even recall what you studied?

While this does not give justification for the lower academic rigour of BTech, given that NUS is ranked so highly in the world, that's your high horse opinion that nobody gives a shit about. What's the alternative to BTech or a PT degree then? Working as a technician in a company earning about 2k a month with kids and a wife to feed (I know a few)? How about staying in the same role for years because you're stopped by your paper credentials?

TL:DR: 

To upgrade oneself is a necessity in this day and age, and BTech students are just trying to create opportunities for themselves to succeed. There's really no justification for being in a quaint little garden of the i-GrAdUaTeD-FrOm-NuS club trying to stonewall those who attempt to get in despite their trying circumstances.

But truly, who the hell cares what your opinion is? Yes, you studied hard in poly to get into FT, yeah you've got a CAP of 5.00. Not all btech students want to merely pass, and not all FT students get cap 5.00. There are exceptions to the norm everywhere, and this applies to Btech too.

We're all trying to carve our own niche in the world in our own unique way. Let's stop bringing each other down and being so salty.

But that said at least make sure the tech/framework you will be picking up is useful to you down the road.

I entered a german MNC with a vague AF job scope, forced to learn SAPUI5 frontend framework. The framework is old, heavy and shitty when compared to React, Angular, Vue.

Development skills are 80% self taught, given time we can learn and pick up any tech stacks. But we need to be selective and choose the tech stacks that has the best ROI. In short, learn from my suffering and make sure you get a concrete job scope before accepting the internship offer.

It is one thing to take a personal preference as to the type of entertainment you wish to consume, but it is another to diss and deprecate the local entertainment industry altogether. 

We are a generation that grew up watching local television shows - be it kids central, okto, channel 8, suria whatever. We are lucky enough to experience development in technology allowing us to access netflix, amazon prime and youtube. But didn't this freedom in choice come with age and exposure to technology? Aren't the young children today still doing the same? Don't we hope that they have the same, wonderful memories and childhood that we all did? 

Another point would be the local entertainment industry, as with traditional media everywhere, is struggling to retain viewership as it is. If we don't respect our local entertainment industry enough to at least leave it alone when it doesn't align with our preferences, who will? If we don't support fellow Singaporeans, who will? 

Last point I promise. There is still much value in ""tacky"" television dramas. For the older folk who continue to draw much joy from them, these programmes are necessary for them to first, keep up with the times and second, understand the pioneer/merdeka generation stuff/CPF stuff etc. Young people claim that the older generation doesn't understand them - think mental health issues, modern day stresses. What if these are woven into the television programmes? what if they help your extended family become less judgmental during family gatherings for example - Would you still say the same about it? 

Not everything is about you, or even your generation. Just because you and your peers or even family don't take to it, doesn't justify your going around despising local entertainment.

Let me first state the obvious; 
Money means everything. 

It not only has the ability to give you immediate material satisfaction, but also gives second, third and fourth chances in life. Didn't study hard in O Levels? Its fine, just go overseas to an easier education system, compete among the weaker students. Messed up your A Levels real bad and can't make it into a course you desire in a Singapore University? Just go overseas to a less competitive one, and come back maybe several years later.

How can you say overseas students are any less intelligent than local students (pre A-levels) some of you may comment. Lets be realistic here. The education system in Singapore is analogous to a sieve, with each major exam being a filter. At the PSLE, all students competed against one another. When it comes down to the A Levels, the strongest of us remain, fighting for those few places in the courses we wish to pursue. Most of the students flying overseas are those caught in the sieve.

Is the purpose of the post to criticise the education system? Ironically enough, it isn't. While most people like to poke at the system, saying it is ""elitist"" and ""unnecessary stress"", it cannot be denied that when entering ANY university, grades are the easiest, most tangible method of ranking us.

I am not talking about students who go to Cambridge, Imperial or those top grade universities. I do not criticise the students who took less completive courses overseas because there is some truth to wanting to see the world in your youth. I am not talking about scholars as they earned their places. I speak against those who took the easy way out, could afford to fly to an unknown, less competitive university, pursue the course they desire, and then fly back, with the smirk satisfaction that they have achieved their dream career. You however, are no better than me, and definitely should not think of coming back to Singapore. Your foreign degree should not be recognised in Singapore when trying to get work as you are a heck lot dumber than our students.

Yes, I am salty as heck. But if I cannot buy the chances you all were given, at least let me having the privilege of ranting for free.

1426,"Reading the whole saga about the FWB guy supposedly knocking up the girl and now debating who should take responsibility for what, it left a very sour taste in my mouth. 

You wanna know what's worse than that? Going abroad to study, thinking you'd be in a LDR with your GF back in Singapore for those three years and then come back to her. Only to get a message halfway into Freshers' Week when you're overseas settling into life there from your girlfriend telling you she's breaking up with you out of guilt... because apparently despite only being together three months earlier, despite her losing her virginity to you only two weeks before you flew off, and always using protection thereafter, she tells you that she somehow found out she was pregnant and that she's already gotten a chemical pill abortion without even telling you anything beforehand. 

Then drop everything you were doing there and buy air tickets to fly back to try and see her and salvage anything possible. Not even knowing if she was lying about the pregnancy because so much didn't seem right about her story, or if it was really true and you just lost your first child that you'd have gladly taken responsibility for. And the final kicker? Arrive back in Singapore, but never get to see her again because she freaked out about you actually being serious enough to fly back to look her up again, and getting her mother to turn you away and leave things irrevocably broken. 

Bonus part of this story: one year later you return to Singapore for summer holidays and somehow manage to meet up with your ex's close friend. And then you hear from her that your ex was never pregnant. That she made that whole story up because she feared that I would be attracted by Western girls overseas, and in her fear of being cheated on she decided to break things off first but somehow couldn't do so directly. Hence the cooking up of the fake pregnancy and abortion story, because somehow in society the stereotype is of guys knocking girls up but running away at the first opportunity to shirk their share of responsibility. Not expecting you to actually NOT be one of those stereotypical guys, not expecting you to fly back halfway around the world for her, not expecting that you were actually serious about keeping the relationship and possibly even the baby if it were a real thing. 

Yeah, this is the story of my life. This is a major reason why I'm so scarred when it comes to relationship and love. And to that confessor who actually dared to comment about how much money he spent on condoms in that confession, I really spit on you for being such a disgrace to us men, for your absolute lack in placing priority on the right things, and for your petty complaint and whining.

Nobody wants this to happen. And since it’s explicitly stated that it’s a fwb relationship, it should be obvious that it is a free-from-responsibility relationship.

Furthermore, everytime I’m the one paying for condom, she didn’t even pay a single cent. 

Basically, I’m indignant and annoyed that why girls like to play the victim game when they get pregnant? Why the onus is always on the guy to be responsible? It takes 2 hands to clap, I didn’t force her to have sex with me. Also, it’s not as if she don’t know the risk. She did all these willingly knowing that it’s fwb relationship.

“It is hard when you put in effort to get everything going well, but if you miss out on one thing, it is the only thing that is focused on. People don't appreciate all that you have done but they blame you for what goes awry.” 

First of all, thank you for your hardwork contributed in nursing people back to health. :)

I believe healthcare workers can all relate to this. Some may say that this happens across all jobs, but let me tell the readers that it happens the worst in healthcare.

We (aka Doctors, Pharmacists, Nurses, Therapists, Dieticians and all allied health workers) are frontline workers who are battling life-and-dearh situations all the time, and even if not critical, we are healing people back to their normal health. Healthcare is a depressing place, because nobody comes here except the unwell, diseased or injured. People don’t thank us when they recover from their sickness, because it is expected that they will recover and walk out normally. But when a mistake is made, patients immensely blame us because they often overreact and immediately associate a mistake with death or serious health consequences to their loved ones. Even colleagues are harsh on each other.

In reality, being in Singapore with top healthcare facilities, services and professionals, we as healthcare workers pride and push ourselves to be perfect, so most mistakes are those which will not affect the patient negatively in terms of health outcomes. When detected, we’re quick to resolve it, cause “patients first”. 

My main points to the readers are:
- If you are from non-healthcare, both healthcare workers and admin staff would benefit from some form of appreciation from you. Even the most simple thank-you goes a long way for us ????, especially when we face sick, grumpy and unhappy people everyday. (Who comes into clinics/hospital happy?!) 
- if you are from healthcare careers, remember to give each other pats on the back and be optimistic. Optimism is something really lacking in our industry, which i admit i forget at times as well.

Long post but thank you #61440 for your contributions as a Nurse. Even if you are thinking of quitting, hope you get a vacation soon to rest your health!

From a fellow healthcare worker :)

Rmb went out b4 with this super out-of-my-league girl for a meal, then I payed first because I walked to the door first. She offered to PayLah me back, but that time my account got frozen because of some small useless stuffs, so I told her I would text her when I got the thing sorted out.
But KNS ended up the account got fixed after CNY, so all the debts all erased mah! Then ofc I can't ask her for the money because (i) like it's so cheap of me to chase back 1 small meal (it wasn't anything fantastic) and (ii) the CNY mark passed to the debt is erased then if the debt is still valid then is like I sabo'ed her into bad luck right? 
So actually it's just a small meal so I can't really be bothered, but then I'm scared I offended her because like those very strong independent girl refuse to let guys pay for them right? And I understand la it's not like I'm her bf or anything so no good reason for me to chia her also...
So my conscience is clean cuz I didn't pay to ""preserve my fragile manhood"" or ""preserve the patriarchy"" or whatever lame shit, but I do feel like it was just a stupid story so quite funny share wif u all lor...

There are definitely a lot of things that can be improved. It is unfair to rant about Prof. Chia as if he had been doing a bad job. I believe he had been very supportive to the students taking this course. In terms of workload, it is definitely not light, but for this module, I believe the deadline for the assignments are quite okay. In terms of practical exam, I do admit that it was quite tough. I am not saying this because I could do the exam well. I could not even pass level 1 for the second practical. I am not sure how others do for this practical. In my opinion, I do think that the question is difficult to understand. I personally could not even understand what the question wanted us to do. This explains why I could not even pass level 1. Personally, I do think that for the second practical assessment, the question should have been much clearer. It would have been better if it was clear. I myself could not understand the question and there was no way I could think of how to solve the question in the first place. However, it is UNFAIR if anyone complain that Prof. Chia is a bad prof simply because of this one practical. Just because of one unclear  practical (this is my opinion), how can you say that this prof is bad. I do hope that he could do something to help us understand the question, or rectify this problem. But, the practical has passed as well. I also do not think there is much he can do regarding the second practical. The only thing he could do now is perhaps only the grading/marking. I believe that he knows what he needs to do about this. He is a good prof. I just hope that people won't accuse him so badly without concrete base.

They may treat me like a 'friend' and call me a 'friend' but I don't see it at all. I'm clearly low on their priority list when I text them and they take 1-2 days to respond.  Meanwhile, they can text their REAL friends back and forth within milliseconds. Or they don't bother jio'ing you to hang out yet can jio their real friends to hang out all the time.

It's even worse when they have girlfriends/boyfriends since it's obviously their girlfriend/boyfriend >> you. 

And this further sucks since I never get the chance to even cultivate relationships. And even if I do, what does it matter? I'm just a typical friend # 101, out of their 200+ other friends. 

How do I make close friends if everyone else has close best friends to begin with?? Look at uni even...unless you stay hall, the friends you make in uni are never close to you either since they already have their established close friends (from sec school, poly, JC, church etc..).

I'm an NUS undergrad, whose faculty does not comment on NUSWhispers often (always studying). My seniors are way too busy and don't come to school most of the time so they don't really read this page. But I do read this page for entertainment sake and let me say that I really love this page. The thought processes and reasoning evident by the unique netizens in the comment section here is well... unique. Needless to say, it is very different from the opinions and arguments which my faculty mates and I have (by many many many miles).

In my faculty, brains and critical thinking are a must if I want to communicate effectively with my peers, and not receive those judgemental ""what are you talking about"" eyes.
Here, it seems that the same method of argument does not apply! If the amygdala hijack mechanism taught briefly in school needs a prime example, most of the netizens here would be it.

Personally, the comments here are like a break from work. In school, I analyse different problems and pains people face, and how I could better help them when they consult me. But here, I look at the arguments/advice posed by netizens, and try to reason out these thought processes.

Let me tell you, the latter is undoubtedly more puzzling, albeit infinitely more entertaining.

Go ahead, criticise my imperfect enGRISH.

But on the flip side, I find local/Asian girls impossibly suffocating with their relative passiveness, lack of opinions, a general feeling of total sheltered upbringing, sexual conservativeness, and shallowness in life, happy to just be distracted by vapid topics of what's the latest in showbiz or workplace gossip or shopping or fashion or whatever. 

Am I the only one who feels this way? Or am I holding local girls to standards too high for them to meet?

1482,"In light of all the angsty retorts due to the recent Z's case, as evident from this page, I would like to give some of my perspectives on this issue.

I grew up in a relatively conservative Asian family, and I would consider myself a feminist. However, for the past few years, I have been afraid to tell people that I am a feminist, and even to the extent of being afraid to admit that I am one. 

As a female who has seen and witnessed many forms of sexism, be it in school or society, I was drawn to advocate for the idea of feminism, the ideal society where females are seen as equals as male. I attended an all girls secondary school, and it was very easy to find friends who resonated with my perspective. Fast forward to my adult life, I realised that the moment i mentioned that i was a feminist, I would be met with a startled and perhaps disgusted response from my male counterparts, and sometimes even my female friends will ask me to drop it.

As an adult now, I do understand why the word 'feminism' is such a taboo topic, especially in Singapore where females are not as blatantly disadvantaged as compared to other societies. Some might even argue that females have a greater advantage compared to males, as evident from the rising reported cases where females accuse the male of r***, even though it may not have happened at all.

Truth is, I do not know how to feel about the phrase ""victim blaming"" anymore. Bottomline, the way a girl dresses does not warrant an invitation to be harassed, and if you disagree with that you are an a**hole and deserve to be incarcerated. Sexually harassing a female when they are vulnerable, e.g. drunk, is not justifiable, and like i mentioned before, you deserve the full brunt of the law.

However, the grey area begins when consent is involved. What warrants a consent for s**ual intercourse? I mean for starters, I don't give verbal ""yes you can go ahead"" consent before I do it with my boyfriend. But under the Singapore law, I have the ability to sue my bf for rape, and maybe even get him charged. Hence, I do recognise the grey area in such situations, and herein lies the crux of the problem. 

In many many cases, when a girl reports being harassed, the authorities usually do not charge the guy due to lack of evidence of denied consent. And that sucks, it really does. It makes me scared as a female, scared that one day something does happen to me, and my perpetrator can get away scott free, while I am just labelled as ""the girl who made a false claim"".

However, I do recognise the circumstances in which this can be exploited, which is why although I am a firm believer of consent, I also believe that we females should not land ourselves in a situation where the need for consent is blurred. Examples would be going overseas with someone and sharing a bed, locking both of yourselves behind closed doors in a room, making obvious sexual advances throughout the night in an isolated place. Even though your intention may not be s**, but just know that there is a very weak case for you if anything does happen.

In the case of Z, I was more alarmed by the fact that the ""innocent before proven guilty"" law did not apply to him. From what I heard, he lost his sponsorship and his housing accommodation in school, amidst circumstances where many victim's stories were debunked and said to be untrue. I do not know what to believe, because this applies to the grey area of consent which I aforementioned, but it is just scary to think that social media now has the ability to destroy someone before the facts are even verified.

Although I did mention that many of such cases usually go unreported or even dismissed by the authorities, is this really a step forward? With anonymous accounts sending anonymous stories, is that really the truth? 

Welp, I'm just confused rn. Hopefully that dude gets what he deserves if the stories are indeed true, but if it isn't, I fear for the future of our generation and how there will be a shift of sentiment to ""guilty until proven innocent"". In any case, cheating is wrong, so screw you dude.

2) “It’s not the materialistic things in life that matter. Have you learnt the learning of love?”

3) “marks, marks, marks. Just cold, hard figures, right? Don’t you know other stuff humans live for? What is music, what is love, what is art? These are what feed our soul, not marks!”

1486,"I recently took a module on IE2100, Probability Models with Applications. It was perhaps the most unfair and unacceptable test that any NUS student can take. Let me explain why: 
Firstly, students who arrive in the exam lecture theater before the start of the exam can immediately start the paper. As some students effectively arrive 30 minutes before the paper, they are allocated 30 minutes more to work on their mid-term.

Secondly, the lecturer provided ""hints"" on the projector screen without telling students about it. This lead to around half of the cohort which did not see the hints on the projector at all as they simply referred to their question paper which they took from the lecturer. Some students also did not see it as they were sitting at the back of the lecture theater, which make it hard for them to look at the projector screen, as it was assumed that the lecturer was flashing the same ""question paper"" as what was given to students.

Upon complaints by students after the end of the paper, the lecturer stated that he will reward the final grade base on the higher of the scores from either the mid-term or the finals. However, this leads to a systematic unfairness for students who did not see the ""hints"" as during the finals, all the students will likely be given the same question paper. This will make it exponentially hard for students who did not see the ""hints"" to catch up to their peers.

I do hope that by sharing about the unfairness from this exam, NUS can possibly take some actions with regards to this issue.

But for the past few weeks, they ask me to visit even on days when our schedules are different.. even if we can only be together for a few hours. They seem to be more touchy-feely although it isn't like them at all, and they keep saying that they miss me. Yet, they insist that they wouldn't like me in a romantic way. I'm not sure whether I'm over-thinking it, but I hate when feelings like these are unresolved. What should I do? Should I confront them about their actions or should I just keep quiet for the sake of this friendship?

1490,"This is gonna be a heavy topic. I have a uncle overseas who's unmarried for personal reasons. I'll see him everytime i go visit my extended family. He is an extremely independent and fit person before, but old age has caught up with him. He now suffers from lung and back compilations because of his work, and with each passing year i see him able to cover less distance before tiring out. As he was very benevolent to his nieces and nephews during our younger days, i'll gladly help him with his chores whenever i have a chance to visit. He lives on his own, in a country where caretakers frequently takes advantage of the vulnerable groups. On 1 occasion, i asked him how's he gonna cope when he's eventually physically or worse, mentally impaired. As he's a prideful person, he finds it unacceptable to burden his friends or his siblings when they too are struggling to support their families at that age, so he jokingly told me he'll end himself. Obviously that's a horrible idea, but i couldn't argue with him since if i were in his shoes i'll probably say the same thing
That leads me to the main topic, which is social security. As a single child who plans to remain unmarried, i know that there'll come a time when i'm physically or mentally incapacitated and i face the same problem. i have friends that i know will help me manage my day when i'm injured, but i can't expect to leave my own care-taking to them when they have their own families in the future. What are the options for people like me? Is finding a partner still a choice?

Recently, there is a scandal involving this guy z from NUS.

 I just want to say ,sure, this guy is definitely in the wrong. However, it takes 2 hands to clap.

If you thirsty girls dint give him the opportunity to play around with you, then we might not have the outcome that is currently happening now.

It is obvious that you girls like the thrill of playing with fire. For example, you get in the room with him one to one (even though u know his character) and all the other acts that give the other party the wrong impression. 

Don't play with fire and afterwards complain why did you get burned by the fire. Ask yourself this question, who was the one that lighted the fire in the first place?(:

Even though there are two people running for the same position, it seems as though one of them, A, is running just to help the other, B, get the position. A and B are really good friends. Some have even heard him (A) advocating for the other candidate (B). 

Now, instead of the 70% vote of confidence B would have needed if he ran uncontested, he only needs 50%. And he might get it because not everyone is aware of their relationship and what A/B is actually doing.

It seems that you are just a insecure prick and have no faith in your girl. You resort to violence to keep guys away and this tells a lot about you. You are abusive and might harm her in future so please consult UHC.
Warning her or resorting to unorthodox method to keep her in your clutches only proves that you are immature. I have seen lot of guys hurting girls this way but they have the courage to voice it out but not pulling little tricks behind her. 
While you called other guys selfish, you are the real manipulative and selfish guy. It might be wrong to break up couples but should the girls just stick with their Boyfriends even if they know that their boyfriends are not the one they should be with? You are afraid of losing her and you don’t care whether she would be happier with someone else. Your love is selfish. True love should be wanting best for her even knowing you are not the one.

1506,"Hello friends! I have a bit of a dilemma... I have been asked if I want to go for a selection for national team for a sport, but the selection tournament is a few days before exams, and even if I get in, it would be quite tough to balance school and training.
Hoping to ask some opinions so I can think a bit more about it, please be nice to me!

FOR TAKING PART
1) I'm actually a beginner in the sport, but I have a lot of experience in other sports so actually I can sort of get by in spite of my inexperience. I am legit ""not too bad"" so I would find it wasted to not take part.

2) I really like this sport, and I always wanted to have a ""cool guy"" image but actually in school days I was always quite fat and slow and gross so I want to test myself here and prove that I am a cool guy who possible to represent SG in something. My grades are quite shit anyway so I really want to have something to show for my youth and I don't want to be a regretful old fart next time. Esp because the world championship is only 1-in-4-years.

3) If I get selected, I would get to go to other country for competition, which is very cool. Even if I don't get selected, I would have fun at the tournament.

AGAINST TAKING PART
1) As a beginner, it's a bit arrogant and presumptuous to think I can go so far... And am I going too fast? Should I focus on my basics and go at it slow and steady instead? I feel like if I take part and screw up then I might ""burn out"" my love for the sport which is stupid also...

2) Although I want to grab this chance, I also want to study properly also. If I neglect my studies, then it's also like I'm running away from my duty as a student to do my work properly because it's a stake in my own future. I understand that it's only 1 exams period, but like if I bochup my studies here then I might do it again down the road then yada yada yada I will end up being a half-hearted human who just keeps running away from something that I'm not good at also... Then there's the factor that I'm not paying for my education so I'm wasting other people's money also...

3) If I take part, I will definitely get hurt because it's pretty rough. It would get in the way of my studying and my normal life also for a few weeks, I expect. So... it's kind of foolish to just try because it's not really ""nothing to lose"" also...

Actually as I type this I know I'm leaning towards not taking part but I just wanted to rant and hear some things back from you guys... :D

From what I see from most media, many single-use plastic replacement materials have the same problem: they are not waterproof, which is what many plastics products are designed for. In fact, many of those are designed to soluble in water. This defeats the purpose of being a ""plastic replacement"" since the job that plastic does so well (waterproofing), the replacement materials are next to useless at it.

I am no materials engineer, so I have no solution to this problem. But if we truly want to make a perfect replacement for plastic products, we need to remember what is the intended purpose of these products in the first place, before coming up with ideas like ""water soluble plastic"".

If you go to the top bar, a menu-bar pops up but 4/6 categories are completely empty of sub-entries? It's like someone just threw their hands up and submitted incomplete work at the deadline. You have to go to their individual pages for each programme (e.g. IDP) and click through another 3-5 pages before getting to actually relevant information such as module descriptions. And I'm not a fan of the new-age style web design which is endless amounts of white space, text that takes up only 10% of the screen and forces you to scroll forever, and 1440p ultra-high-res pictures of handsome/pretty smiling students, which is of absolutely zero use. Oh, and large numbers of pages still have not been migrated over from the inaccessible old website, despite it being months since the change (tip to the poor guy trying to find out if he's on deans list, you're probably not).

For those curious, the current computing website is about what the old engineering website was like, and the current science website is slowly morphing into an engineering-like one (somebody please stop them). Frankly the new website is less useful and the change was not needed, and I strongly suspect some kickbacks were passed around to make it happen at all.

I'm a year 4 undergraduate and I've been living in PGP for the last two years because i simply live too far from campus to justify the travel time. It doesn't help at all that my course is notorious for scheduling five day work weeks. This semester I was given a room in a block at the back of the PGP compound, a good ten minute walk from the bus stop if i walk slowly. I hardly see anyone on my floor, I concluded that most rooms are actually vacant because i never see any footwear outside their doors. There is this one other guy that I greet every once in a long while. When I leave for classes, return from my late night study sessions, shower and get things from the communal fridge without seeing anyone at all. It all began two weeks ago, when everything went silent, when the last slipper disappeared from the corridor, except one.

I honestly haven't met the guy before, but lately I keep seeing him when I head to the toilet sometime in the middle of the night (I'm a night owl). Just as I'm exiting the toilet, I always hear the sound of his door closing lightly. Nothing really weird about that, except it has been happening every night, since two weeks ago. There is something about the sound of a closing door that really creeps me out. Doors and locks are pretty bad in PGP, my lock has been spoilt since forever, and PGP maintenance  has yet to fix it. As such are my circumstances, I never lock my room door,. 

When I finally wrap up for the night and go to bed between 2am and 3am, I turn off all my room lights, close the door and fall asleep. Since two weeks ago, I began waking up at a weird time, always to the sound of my door gently closing, I can always hear the latch snapping back into place. Then again I'm not really sure, I'm pretty creeped out anyways. In that groggy semi-awake state I fall back asleep pretty fast, but since a few days ago, falling back asleep got a little harder. I swear its the sound of my door closing that wakes me up again and again.

I'm trying not to overthink things, but I really need to get my door lock fixed, and its getting kind of urgent.

Soooo 3 months ago, my boyfriend of 5 years told me that he was also dating another friend of mine without me knowing and that he wanted a polygamy. That friend of mine told me that she knew he was dating me but she thought that I knew he was dating her too. I told him that I could not accept being in a polygamy. Broke up with him and broke the friendship with her in December.

Met him last week to pass his stuff back to him (I used to help him fix his electronics but he never got them back from me since he often came to my house to play with them anyway). He said he broke up with that friend, and wants me back. I still have feelings for him, but couldn't forgive him, so I rejected him.

After apologising and begging me to go back to him for about an hour, he asked ""I spent so much effort to try to win you back, spent so much money in the past few months trying buy things for you, I lost everything just to get you back, are you telling me that it's all for nothing?""

I never asked for it. I never asked you to buy me anything. When we broke up, you said you felt bad that it's always me who bought you gifts during anniversaries and special events the past 5 years, saying that you were very thankful that I always offer to pay for the meals or allow us to pay for our own meals, yet during the past few months when we never contacted each other much, you're telling me that you've put in a lot of effort and money to win me back? I'm not sure how I should have reacted. I just ran off crying without paying for the bill this time.

More than heartbroken, I felt more disappointment. Disappointed in myself for having feelings for him even after all these farce, disappointed that my friend never told me about their relationship when I always gushed to her about the things that happen between him and I, disappointed in him as a whole.
He's still texting me, yet I can't bear to block him out of my life. I want to move on, yet I still miss him. I can't forgive my friend, yet I wish to have her back in my life.

Except that climate change isnt just warm weather and dying turtles. You want to know about world hunger? Ok. Increased extreme weather events due to climate change, are devastating farms and causing droughts, putting world hunger on the rise again for the first time in decades. Rising sea levels are destroying low-lying islands and putting the poor farmers out of work. Millions are starving, but millions and millions will starve as global warming worsens. 

Of course, world hunger and poverty isn't just caused by climate change. And there are issues besides climate change. War, hunger, -isms, corruption.

Im pretty sure there is more plastic used to make bubble tea straws than normal straws, so why arent they banned as well? It just seems a bit contradictory of the anti-straws people to not campaign for the banning of bubble tea straws as the same arguments that were made for normal straws can be made for the bubble tea straws as well. Is it because their convenience of drinking the pearls>> their arguments on saving the earth here?

1534,"I am absolutely disgusted by the response you guys had for our fellow NUS student, namely the person who just broke up. 

To quote his article below, ""I recently broke up with my girlfriend. I took it really hard cuz she has been thinking for it for awhile yet she has never told me. It exploded on me when I am most vulnerable...
....
....
I am so broken now I'd literally tell anyone willing to listen. Idk if all break ups are like this, but this seems unnecessarily painful. Maybe you should have waited until I am less emotional. Maybe do it during our good timesml. Dont let go babe....""

To those people in the comment section who are calling him too needy, being too clingy etc, all of y'all ought to reflect on yourselves. Read the last paragraph. ""I am so broken now I'd literally tell anyone willing to listen"". And all you guys did was to bash him for being too needy, and even accuse him of being the toxic one in the relationship?? As a society, we have failed. As a NUS community, we lack basic empathy. We have a depressed young man who just broke up, and seriously all that is said to him was that he was the problem in the relationship? I just hope that none of your friends will ever come to y'all for advice next time, because I am absolutely disgusted and outraged by your lack of basic human empathy.

Sure, you may blame him for coming to such a platform to pour his heart out, and even say that he ""had it coming to him"". But coming here just highlights his desperation and vulnerability, and need for comfort at such a difficult time. All he needed were encouraging statements, perhaps ""learn from what went wrong, be it you or him, and move on"" could be all he needed to hear at this point in time. I really hope you guys are ashamed of yourselves, for kicking someone when he is down, for ignoring someone's cry for help, for literally causing more harm than good just because you wanted to look good and score brownie points on the internet.

1536,"Frankly, I can't stand people who say ""it should be entirely a choice to go green, there shouldnt be green policies or legislation"". Yes, the straws are not tackling the real issue, but even if we introduce effective policies, people will still keep wailing ""I want my choices, you're inconveniencing me!"". 

""Going green should come from the heart"", ""you must rely only on people changing their mindsets, not making rules"". Yeah those are nice but naive statements. What makes you think people will be so willing to go green out of nowhere, if they are already this butthurt about straws? Do you really think that simply encouraging people, instead of making rules, is effective? Do you know how long it takes to make that kind of soft cultural change? If you make rules now, people will learn to adapt and change their culture much faster. If you have seen any news about climate change recently, you will realize how urgent things are. 

Without green policy, most people won't voluntarily go green from the pure goodness of their heart. 

Especially in singapore, where apparently, it might be unliveable by 2070, but people here are still writing strangely sexual rants railing against green policy. Yes, straws arent the real issue, but if we ban wider plastic use, we will still see some of these people crying about their freedom to pollute. For them, I wonder if they want to be literally dying of heatstroke in 2070 while saying ""at least I can get my soda in a plastic cup""

Anti-straw is a mostly useless diversion, but green policies are still needed. Policies, and not encouragement. Shoved up your butt figuratively? Yes. We have no time. Hell, even encouragement instead of rules has people saying ""you're rubbing it in my face!"". Then yes, we are.

In comparison to straws, that doesn't add convenience, destroys the environment unnecessarily, and is a cost saving method to companies. Instead, of straws which in comparison to all the starbucks takeaway-cups and disposable plates, comprise much less environmental harm AND actually give us convenience. Banning straws makes life that bit more annoying for everyone, and cuts costs for companies who may not even re-invest that extra savings into saving the environment. Let's be smart about it.

After a week, i remembered that i had registered my card in the ez link mobile app. When I went to check the past transactions, i realised someone had been using my card to travel around instead of returning it to the lost and found. 

It is unbelievable that auniversity student are doing this. The amount i lost was not much (less than $5). What was more disappointing was the lack of honesty by the person who took the card. 

So, if you are reading this, i will just let you know that you will have to face the guilt of having travelled around using someone else's money regardless of how much you used from the card.

1556,"There seems to be a lot of animosity between the anti straw people and the pro straw people. However, I would like to make an observation that none of us are actually pro-straw, but rather, pro convenience. For example,it is absolutely ridiculous to serve ice milo with sedimentation at the bottom of the cup without straws, and expect customers to have their own metal straw beforehand. 

Why am I so against this movement you may ask? Firstly, the hassle involved in washing a metal straw and keeping it is extremely tedious, and very unsanitary if I may add. Firstly, placing a wet metal straw in a cloth bag while it is still wet is just a friendly invitation for bacteria and fungi to grow in, but hey, your life your decisions right. Secondly, which I feel is the most important reason, is that the majority of people are either pushed into this movement by peer pressure or by moral standards set by society. While this may be a good thing in alleviating plastic waste, it does nothing, absolutely nothing, in solving issues related with the environment. Saving the environment should stem from a desire from oneself, and only then will someone make individual and conscious decisions to reduce waste. A few plastic straws isn’t going to make a difference, and contrary to popular belief, it is not even a small step forward, because nothing is done to change the mindset of people. Thirdly, metal straws are now just a commodity which many school projects and businesses exploit. Selling metal straws at high prices to raise funds, coupled together with articles on poor turtles, are just painting a really bad light on this situation. 

Definitely, there are going to be environmental warriors in the comment section crying foul, claiming that reducing plastic straw is the best way to go forward and it is a tangible contribution to reduce plastic waste. Nah it isn’t fam. You can go and speak to any vendors who removed their straws because I did. None of them give a damn about this movement, but they just did it because it was mandatory. Which brings me back to my whole issue on changing the mindset, and I can safely say that the plastic straw movement has triggered more people than it inspired. This is bad implementation on NUS side. Get off your moral high horse, Google the minuscule effect that the anti straw movement is doing in Singapore (please don’t quote me an American article with just optimist applauding the fact that we are taking a step forward). Use your time instead advocating for the ban of plastic bags in shopping malls, because in contrast to plastic straws, the benefit this has drastically outweighs the inconvenience on consumers

1559,"Exchange student here, been reading complains about CS2030. I have 2 suggestions, practices currently done in my college, that perhaps the course coordinators can consider: 
1. Fixed weekly consultation slots held by student teachers. I understand that in NUS student teachers are paid per hour and not paid an incentive if they conduct consultations outside of formal lesson timeslots? If so, I would suggest that weekly consult times be made 'formal' and these student teachers be paid accordingly. With the number of student teachers in this mod, maybe 30mins-1hr per student teacher should cover the entire week, allowing students some guidance over asking google. It is only fair to expect student teachers to be unwilling to take questions outside of lesson time if they are not compensated for it. However, at current, consultations with the prof seems to be a challenge as well.
2. Releasing of answers immediately after submission of assignments. Not sure what the teaching methodology is here, but back home, coding is taught through lots and practice, feedback and reading other people's codes. I suppose providing insightful feedback on our code comes at a cost giving the cohort size, but providing the solutions to our weekly assignments comes at almost no cost. I m sure students will benefit if they could have some form of reference instead of coding blindly every lab not knowing how they can do better.

So I found out my ex cheated on me when she recently went on exchange. I tried to forgive her, gave her a second chance, only to find out she got involved with more guys again later on. Imagine a hot knife being slowly driven down your back with a good ol twist at the end. So I wanted to know what really happened and what I did wrong but all I got were inconsistent stories where I found out she was actually omitting and twisting the facts. 

I even found out after that that she was lying to me all along about her previous infidelity and that she had actually cheated on her ex too, which honestly would have changed my mind about getting together with her in the first place. Looking back, I still remember the way she used to tell me about how she ""valued"" honesty and transparency, as if to distract me or divert my suspicions away from her. 

I finally left her but with all the lies I've been fed, I really don't know what to believe anymore. She loves to flirt with other guys (even when I'm physically standing next to her) and I wouldn't be surprised if there were more third parties involved. 

Tbh I had a strong feeling something was wrong from the beginning(and throughout) and I beat myself all the time for not acting on my suspicions and leaving her earlier.

1573,"Hi, just asking for advice. I hooked up with this guy a couple of times over tinder and we're on quite good terms. The main problem is that we've since gotten attached and my boyfriend has an issue with me seeing my exes, which I don't have an issue with since I haven't talked to any of them in like, 3 years. The question is whether I should stop talking to this past hookup of mine, let's call him A, in case my bf finds out about our history and sees an issue with it?

I can't raise the question to my bf since he's very clearly stated that he doesn't care and doesn't want to know about what went on before we got together, and so I've never really told him anything about my past. So well, I can't really ask him, and he's been really firm on not wanting to know... rather aggressive on the point that he doesn't like me hanging out with people I've had sex with before. While I understand that point, I'm kinda offended at the assumption?

I honestly don't think that it will ever come out, since pretty much only me and A know about it, and seeing as both of us are attached we're not about to tell anyone about it anyway, and it's not like my bf will look through my phone to find out about it, and I'm not even sure it's in my chat history anymore.

Just some context about A, he's not exactly a close friend that I see every day, but he's someone I'd say hi to when I see him. We haven't caught up, and I don't go out to see him one on one or anything. I do sometimes reply to his instastories, but he rarely posts anymore, so that's been a while too. I just see him around my faculty when he walks over for his electives and we do a quick hi-bye kinda thing. I don't have feelings for him and I'm more than certain he doesn't have any too. I'll be completely okay with cutting him off.

Thing is, I think my bf has an issue with me and my exes/hookups/past whatever because he thinks that when I meet someone I've hooked up with or had sex with in the past, I'd be reminded that we had sex... or like assumes that somehow I'd want to have sex with them again or something. I'm not that kinda person, I mean, that's kinda demeaning right? So I've been kinda thinking to talk to my bf about it, but my bf clearly doesn't want to talk about it.

So I'm just asking the guys here, if you see some girl you've hooked up with in the past, say a couple of years back, is the sex the first thing that comes to mind?

TL;DR, I have issues with my bf's demands on a motivational level, no issue with doing what is asked, but have problems with his assumptions for making the demand of me.

Sorry for long post, but I don't have a potato.

I as a plastic straw user do not force those who do not want to use metal straws or no straws at all to use them. Both drinking from a cut seal and paper straw is disgusting. Call me pampered if you like but the former generally results in some drink getting on the outside of the cup while the latter just adds a weird off-putting cardboard taste in your drink. Given such ""strong"" support from NUS to remove these straws I suggest bring them back and see how much usage has actually dropped from these forced measures. All this is doing is pissing off and converting previously neutral consumers. NUS wouldn't be the institution it is without the many thousands of students that study here and such changes which impact almost every single person could be done more democratically I feel? Granted this is not a big issue of life and death but the fact of the matter is that it does affect the entire school population. Would really like to hear the general view of you guys out there.

1. No way to stay sign in. Every single day, I have to sign in just to use it.. Every single day, you are wasting ppl precious time to sign in.

2. Lecture timeout. When I pause a lecture to do something else, upon returning, I will be directed away to the main page... Do you know how troublesome it is to locate the lecture, and try to guess which lecture it was that you are viewing just now?

3. Lecture page on back pressed. After I watched finished a lecture, when I want to return and watch another lecture, the back button will return me to the overview page instead of the lecture selection page.. An extra click is a failed software engineering approach.

- No marker or sort for us to indicate which lectures we have watched. Every time, I have to manually go and click the lectures to see if I have watched those before.

I realised that whenever I use IVLE, it is more enjoyable. The thoughts of using LumiNUS turn me off with all the above frustrations I know I have to go through. Granted, these are not significant problems. But these are usability problems that bring unnecessary frustrations to people..

1577,"Hi,

As a third year female student in SoC,  I would like to ask my fellow female Computing students if you have experienced any form of discrimination in SoC. I am wondering if my experiences are just born out of sheer bad luck, or that there is a systemic problem. 

For context, I have not had the opportunity to work with any girls in any of my CS mods. All my group mates in my 3 years have been guys, and I am also the only girl in my social circle in school. This is why I have had to resort to asking this question on NUSWhispers. To be honest, it doesn't bother me at all that I only interact with guys because it doesn't really make a difference to me. However, there are a few instances that have frustrated me and henceforth would like to bring up.

When I took CS1101S in year 1, I distinctly remember a group project meeting where the 3 other guys in the group treated me like nothing I said was of value. I repeatedly suggested a solution to one of the problems (it was the robot project thing) but yet my group members just completely ignored what I said, and eventually ignored the suggestion after hearing me out. I really tried to get them to try my method but they just continued doing whatever they were doing, not even addressing me. After half an hour (yes, I was watching the clock), one of them suggested the exact same thing I had been trying to tell them and decided to give it a try. It worked. My first instinct was, are they ignoring me because I am a girl? But then I tried to rationalise it and tell myself maybe it was because I had less experience in programming as compared to them. But if this were true, why did they listen to and value the contributions of this other guy who was doing so badly in class that he eventually switched majors at the end of the semester? I am not saying that my opinions are better than this guy's, but if my lack of experience or skill had anything to do with why I was ignored, why did they listen to a guy who was inexperienced/unskilled like I was?

Also, I have constantly found myself in situations where guys would say ""even she did better than me on the lab/test/assignment"", where she = me. They don't say this about each other or about other guys. Just me. And it's not like I am always lagging behind in my grades, I always do okay for myself. But they seem to be continuously surprised whenever my grades are better than theirs. Perhaps it's just the people around me who are insensitive and these people are not representative of the SoC population. However, I would like to take the opportunity to quickly raise awareness on the issue of implicit bias against females in male-dominated industries. 

This is a complicated issue. But let me ask you this: if you were to be a meeting with a software engineer, would you not expect the person to show up to the meeting to be a guy? Not saying that there aren't female software engineers. However, the disproportionate number of males in the tech industry has made us immediately think of males when we think of software engineers. This is a vicious, self-enforcing cycle. The lack of representation will make girls subconsciously exclude a future in the tech industry when considering their career options because they (subconsciously) don't think it's for them at all. So the number and hence proportion of females in the tech industry will not increase, which again leads to lack of representation and the implicit bias. This is a gross oversimplification but I hope you get the idea. 

Thanks for sticking it out with me and if there are girls in male-dominated fields who would like to share their experiences please do so. Thank you!

1580,"I’m in year 4 now and I feel exactly the same way I did when I first entered NUS 4 years ago. Happy and naive. 

I have been liking someone for 6 years now. I met him in JC. I know he doesn’t love me back,but so? 

I spend every day in NUS, from year 1 to year 4, stalking him on Instagram and Snapchat. It’s a one sided relationship for 6 years, and I always find excuses to talk to him. Whenever he responds, I feel Super happy. Whenever I talk to him over the phone, my heart swells with joy.

I knew right from the start that he doesn’t feel the same way back, but he DOESNT OWE ME ANYTHING. Loving him one-sided, unconditionally, has become the GREATEST OF ALL JOYS. I don’t expect anything from him in return, yes, for all the 6 years. 

In year 1 and year 2, I have watched with confusion how my friends cried and cried and cried after they were dumped. I told them about this guy whom I love unconditionally without expectations, and they told me that they cried because they follow the basic human nature of being “ selfish”. They said no human isn’t “selfish”, everyone will feel sad if love isn’t returned. Simply because of selfishness.

In year 3, 4 friends came to me and told me straight to my face that I “need help” because I was “weird”. They proceeded on to warn me that I am “not being fair to myself” and I’m supposedly “hurt deep inside”(...????) I don’t understand, which part of it is supposed to hurt? Am I supposed to become selfish too? 

It’s already year 4, I have secured a job offer (company name not disclosed here to remain anonymous) and I’m still in love with that same someone whose smile, whose words, whose social media posts, have kept me warm and happy for the past 6 years, 4 in NUS and 2 in JC. I have rejected every other guy whom I feel can’t even measure up. 

And no, I did not shed a single tear when I think of him.

Sorry, but is there a “reason” why it’s “compulsory” for me to feel sad when it’s unrequited? Is there some “rule” that dictates I have to bawl my eyes out stalking his social media?

If you feel hurt in a one sided relationship, does that mean you’re “selfish”? And if I don’t feel hurt, it means I’m “selfless” and “saint-like”? (I’m not, by the way)

I was from NUS and I know some of my friends who ended up being financial advisors or worse, join MLM.

Some of them are even from elite programs like SPS and USP. The worse part is that many of them are foreigners. It is a real insult to Singapore's foreign talent scheme when you give these foreigners subsidies only for them to become insurance agents. 

Then again, an argument can be made that the job market is so difficult for foreigners that these types of job are the only ones available. But if thats the case why bring these foreigners in? Might as well allow more poly students to enter public universities.

Our team formed months before the start of the competition, with the consensus that we are going to go for the win. But why was it that when the competition finally began, I end up being the only one who was truly invested in it?

You guys said you had no time. Fine, but at least acknowledge my messages, be curious about the things I was working on, right? All I got was just a group chat where I was just talking and updating myself on what I was doing. For the entire, freaking month, I felt like I was just talking to myself. 

I had trust in them. After all, some of them were friends that I knew for quite a while. But that is exactly why, I feel so goddamn betrayed. Just why? Are you all really so devoid of time that you can't even acknowledge my messages? Then why do I see one of you active on the game chat I'm in, playing the same game as I am, while I run the data models and do my work?

Really. I don't like to lead. I don't like to stand on the spotlight. I don't like to be the one engaging everyone. I don't like to put in so much effort only to gain nothing out of it. That's why I usually just stick to the sidelines, making sure that I contribute the amount I need, or go just a step further if necessary.

A. Yes there are limited seats. That is how programs work. Sign-ups could have been managed better, but limited is limited. 

B. It isn't first-come-first-served. Where do people get this idea? If they even read about Orbital, it explicitly says it prioritizes cs freshies. 

And you know what? This post is more than just about Orbital. It is also about how some modules are discussed here. What really gets to me is a certain entitled mindset. I don't mean to generalize, but it seems to come a lot from younger compsci majors. 

When you don't get something you want, do you first ask yourself ""why didn't I get it?"" and ""what else can I do?"". But instead, some people have a knee jerk reacion of ""I should get everything I want, and if I don't, it is someone else's fault. It is always someone else not catering to me"" and ""If I don't get what I want or I don't like something, I can't engage in polite feedback and discussion. Just change the whole system to fit my individual desires, even if it makes no sense for the whole"".

CS is an awesome major and we really need people studying it. But that doesnt mean the world revolves around you just because you study it. The world does not change orbit just because CS is the hot new thing and just because you got As in your youth. If you give feedback in a way that is weirdly demanding, clearly rude and overly entitled, I expect that it won't be taken seriously.

I know I don't have to, but then what would have been the point of the thousands of dollars spent on my university education? Of all the time, tears and effort it took - more than it should have taken - to finish my A Levels and get here? 

I prided myself on my sense of direction, once. But I pivoted, grew afraid that I wasn't passionate enough, wasn't cut out for it or that what I wanted didn't have a future in Singapore. ""You've got your As,"" people told me, or maybe I told myself that too. ""You came from a great school. You're here, by virtue of hard work and privilege. Why throw it all away for something you're not even certain about?""

So I made my decision. Chose a course I was fairly interested in and hardly cared for, but it was safe. For months I was convinced it was fine. Today I finally let myself think about what could have been, what my future now might be. Is it presumptuous to ponder over that from my position in the present? No idea, but those thoughts creep into my head all the same.

""It's never too late to change,"" people tell me that too, as do I. But I have to muster up the courage first.

And I have never liked admitting it, but ever since I received my A Level grades and was struck with the possibility of following what I thought had been my dreams, I have been nothing but cowardly.

Recently, there is a rising trend of students regardless from public or private universities,becoming insurance agents or ""financial advisers"". 

They wear suits,or if not office attire from Monday to Sunday. Not sure is it because that is their required attire daily(highly doubt so), or they just want to wear suit and tie just to make themselves look good aesthetically.(nothing wrong with that)

However,some of this people i notice, whenever they put on such attire, their ego become sky high afterwards. It was like as if they never wore office attire before and after wearing it, the way they behave is like as if they are some director or some big shot in the company. For example, they give you the inferior look  just because you are wearing a t-shirt and bermudas while they are wearing their ""superman"" suites.

Well, here is some hard to swallow pills for you guys. Wearing a office attire from Monday-Sunday does not increase your social status anywhere higher. You guys just look like insecure fools,trying to show off externally that you are doing ""well"", when in fact, you guys are just an empty vessel.

Many of you dont even study in a public autonomous university, or worse, leech on your friends and family to buy insurance products just to hit your quotas or get by another day.

Some of my friends own their own tech start-ups that are generating real profits without leeching, while others are on their path to becoming supervisors in fortune 500 companies. Yet they dont wear suit and ties daily and they behave humbly. 

Nothing wrong being an insurance agent or wanting to feel good wearing suit and tie daily.

I am impatient. I don't have the ability to communicate with naive children. I don't see the need to waste my time justifying my actions to people who don't matter, such as mere acquaintances or classmates.
I don't see the point of sugarcoating or beating around the bush. I say things to people straight to their face.
Cause of that, some people say that I am rude.
I am pragmatic. I weigh options, I prioritise. I choose the option that would make the most out of my time. 
I am simple and boring. I eat simple meals. I eat the cheapest meals. I don't instagram my meals. I don't tweet. I don't update my facebook. I just read up about scientific discovery, I don't follow celebrity news or gossips.
I am self-centered. I do not respond to obligatory group meals, class gatherings if I won't be happy going. Even if my friend(s) are involved.
The kinder people say I am introverted. The others use the word @$$. I deny neither accusations.


And from you can read from above, I probably don't have a lot of friends either. I have less than 10. That's probably cause I highly regard the word 'friend' , not just as a status, but as a title, referring to someone I treasure a lot to be , and for me to keep, in my life.
Guess before I lose your interest, let me state this:

This isn't about me, This isn't a self introduction post, a john cena joke or a post looking for a girlfriend.
This is about me wanting to change.

I am a Singaporean guy. 21 this year I just ORD-ed from NS not long ago and I am enrolling into NUS Engineering School this coming new semester.
It is a fresh experience for me. I was a JC student, so I never got to experience the university/poly lifestyle.
While I am eager to start my uni life, eager to learn and move onto the next stage of my life, there is something bothering me.

I hate orientation camps. I don't see the point of doing forfeits or shameful things together to forge new bonds or meet new people.
More than that I actually hate making new friends or meeting new people.
It is bothersome, tiring and to me, a waste of time.
Call me old fashion but I would much rather be on a speed-dating process talking to a stranger over a table and making friends via introduction. And if I don't like him/her , I will just shout: NEXT!

I believe that making friends is no different from dating.
You get to know someone. You evaluate the person's character and you determine if you still want someone like him/her in your life.
That is my opinion. Like I mentioned before, I am pragmatic. And from you would have gathered by now, pessimistic. 
To me, if someone is of a character I don't like, that doesn't make either of us 'bad friends' or 'bad people'.
It is just that since our characters don't match, why bother continue being friendly or keeping in contact?
Sure, we aren't complete strangers, we can still be acquaintances, some would say.
But to a person like me who hates small talk, acquaintances are no different from strangers.

I wasn't always like that. 
Believe it or not, and even I find it hard to believe it myself, I wasn't always like this.
I used to have friends. Whoever talked to me once, that was my friend. That was me... last time.
Then shit happens.
It became so bothersome to hold onto friendship. onto bonds.
It started with a small thing. A birthday gathering. Some couldn't make it on Day 1, others had something on on Day 2.
I had to choose a date.
And I upset some friends.

First came the drama. Arguments, eye stares, hatred.
Then the picking of sides.
Then pettiness and blame kicks in. 
And after everything, I was left standing alone taking the blame from both ends.
""You were the reason the group broke apart."" I remembered hearing.


That, and many other things, made me sick and tired of forging new relationships, making the effort to know people.
I still do, as previously mentioned, have friends. Some. They don't share the same personality as me. Some are even the polar opposite. 
And I am happy with having just them as friends.
I don't need new ones.

I don't need new drama, new picking of sides, and new petty people in my life.
I don't want to go through all the trouble, after putting in all the effort to forge relationships, only for someone else to destroy it. 
And I am the one ending up getting hurt.

To put it in a plain way, guess I was Spongebob, but I ended up being like Squidward
""I built the walls from the bridges that I burnt down.""

People often say that you have to know influential people in life, or broaden your social network or the people you know.
""It is the political game"" they say. ""Office politics""
If that is so I would rather not play the game.

Guess after writing for so long (and thank you, anyone who bothers to read such a lengthy and boring post), I want to know:

What do you think of a person like me? Am I abnormal?
I want to change, but how?
Should I really join such introduction/orientation camps? Would it really change me?
And if it doesn't, I would have wasted money, time and effort, all over again.

Recently I've had someone I considered relatively close (and who had always been really nice to me) tell me things like how ""you (I) should stop trying because you suck at everything"" and ""I look forward to seeing your oral presentation, because it would be hilarious watching the instructor break you down to pieces"". 

I've never said anything so far, because I've always tried to be diplomatic and patient with other people, but I can't help but feel like this bastard has gone too far. How ridiculously disgusting and pathetic it must be for someone to derive such perverse joy from another's suffering. Such schadenfreude indeed.

I almost don't use vulgarities. I always keep quiet. I don't talk unless there is a need or when I feel comfortable. I walk like a gentleman. I don't commit crimes. YET I get picked up on the MOST from both TAs and classmates (especially the female). I get targeted more than any other Ah Beng, Ah Seng, vulgarity-spewing immature guys. I get nasty complaints and comments from my back all the time like ""quiet people are the most dangerous."" ""You don't know what he is thinking."" ""I never heard his voice before."" ""Why he never talk one."" 

HUH? Who are you? Are you my friend? What you want me to say? Why do you need to know what am I thinking? Do I have an obligation to make noise and talk to a bunch of hi-bye acquaintances? I'm thinking of going home to sleep and having sex with my crushes is that what you want to know huh? Just because I'm a guy I need to scold vulgarities is it?

1622,"#60336 your confession just shows how self-entitled you are, Strawberry Generation. Please look at the statistics; for the undergraduate intake in 2018/2019, there are 2147 students in School of Computing while there are 5421 students in Faculty of Engineering, which is slightly more than double of SoC’s. The Research Graduates in SoC has been counted as 283 while there are 1095 Research Graduates in FoE. (coursework graduates are excluded here because they share the same lecture/tutorial space as undergraduates). This is a whopping four times more! Additionally, SoC provide 5 courses while FoE has 10 courses.

FoE also has to allocate a lot of space for laboratories for all 10 departments, because most of them require huge equipment and most of the Research Graduates take up a lot of space and resource for their testing (in order to write their thesis). This is oppose to SoC’s “laboratory” work, which basically takes place in computer labs. FoE also has a canteen, which is shared with SDE, while SoC doesn’t even have one! There are also some external-linked research space that are within FoE (e.g. T-labs) which FoE students don’t use.

Given that there is COM1, COM2 and an upcoming COM3, AND SoC also uses i3, AS3 and AS6, I’m failing to see how NUS is not “prioritising” in giving SoC more space, especially when there is limited land to expand. And no matter how much SoC’s intake has increased, statistics has shown that it is still a relatively small Faculty.

Lastly, you’re a student at NUS. Can’t you at least do some research before making comments irresponsibly?!

people can't catch the point when the lecturer rambles on and on without getting to the main point and there is no webcast to refer to again after the lecture.

Whats the point if a lecturer insists on no webcasts because of their principles or old school ways of teaching/learning, but people start recording the lectures with their own devices anyway?

in that sense, people like me who don't have the means to record the lecture lose out, isn't it?

Its so hard to catch up when i miss something important said in the lecture when the notes are insufficient and there is no webcast, and the goddamn cohort is so competitive and everyone is so apprehensive to sharing their knowledge.

The person thinking about BTO? he might be chasing it because it makes him happy to spend time with his wife in a place they can call their own.

The person thinking about pay? he might be a huge gaming nerd who blows dollars on his gaming rig and vidya (that's me). 

The person who wants a car? he might derive his happiness from long quiet drives, or frequent road trips up north (further than jb)

The person who sells his soul to his employer might be doing so because the job is fun, challenging, meaningful.

The people worrying about wedding costs / great vacations might be materialistic,, who are we to judge if that makes them happy. 

The rest of the faceless people you think have no soul? they might be dancers, part time volunteers, artists, Han culture enthusiasts, amateur home chefs or semi pro gamers. You don't see it because you don't look hard enough.

Projecting your own version of happiness on people and calling them boring because their only source of fun is that one vacation a year shows how much you understand your peers. It also reflects poorly on you.

If you want to get to know a person, look at who they choose to spend their time with. If you feel like you're surrounded with boring people, consider the possibility that your own personality is the one that's keeping you from meeting the cool ones. Don't just talk to people, understand them.Peace out

1636,"Dear #60200,
It is quite simple really. Pharmacy and Nursing are courses that are bell-curved because the admin refuse to allow any changes to occur. Petitions and this idea that bell-curve should be abolished for these courses are not new. Yet we see now the bell-curve.
It is very simple why the admins do not allow for change. Pharmacy and Nursing are just NOT medicine and dentistry. Are they separate faculties? No, Pharmacy is treated as a Science course under FoS and Nursing students graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree. If you do not even treat these healthcare courses as individual faculties like you do for dentistry with its small cohort or medicine  what makes you think the admin in NUS actually care about the welfare of these students? Treat them the same way that you treat the Science faculty with the bell-curve treatment that differentiates the students who already are of similar and high caliber for the sake of what? 
You have raised a fair point that I can only answer you that it is because of NUS' own traditional judgement of how these courses should be in terms of being bell-curved in addition to the fact that they are simply Science courses. There is literally no other reason why healthcare courses like Pharmacy and Nursing deserve this separate treatment from dentistry and medicine. 
If you really do want to change though, you can always try petition number 182637163 and see how it goes again. Will you be even given a non-BS explanation I don't know.

The issue with not having enough resources to cater to the recently 'balloon-ed' cohort size does not apply to just Orbital only. In fact, we have seen it happen multiple times in various introductory modules in both semester 1 and 2 of AY18-19 (don't want to be pointing fingers, but freshmen would know pretty well the few modules that I'm talking about).

1. “Your reasons that an event such as this has limited vacancies is odd. You promote that it will broaden the pathways to our future. If you predicted it is popular, why are you not prepared to increase the number of vacancies? Bad preparation on your part.”
- Last year, 206 teams (412 students) was accepted into Orbital. This year, 576 students are accepted into Orbital. With a 40% increase in intake even though the number of students enrolling into SoC is much lower, how is it fair to say that the coordinator had bad planning? Note that there wasn’t anyone whining about Orbital unlike the kids this year. 

2. “It is as he does not know that an event registration usually lasts at least a day.”
- The coordinator’s job is not to wait for you to apply. The onus is on you to apply before all slots are filled.

In response to #60159
1. “So what kind of concerns are there to prevent taking in more students for Orbital? The cohort size is 1k, yet the intake is only 500.”
- Students need to be graded on the level of achievement. This requires manpower nonetheless. The purpose of the module is for seniors to mentor students on taking the first steps towards software engineering, and not a loophole for students to do shit work and get 4MCs. The higher the number of students accepted, the lower the standards of the mentors. 

2. If you can self learn and not go for workshops, why would you even need Orbital? It sounded like you are upset that there isn’t an opportunity to get 4MC even though you supposedly took it. 

3. “If your server could not handle the load of many projects registered, well…”
The purpose of the system is to accept X number of students. Clearly, that purpose has been achieved when 576 students are able to apply for it. 

4. Unfortunately, there is just a limited number of slots available for orbital. That was the same last year, it is the same this year. It has been propagated to the students that there are limited slots and its allocation is FCFS. 

Frankly, the orbital slots are final. There is just no use whining on the telegram group or on NUSWhispers. The amount of whining on these platforms is really alarming and shows the level of entitlement that you have. Just because you are in SoC, just because you are a CS major doesn’t automatically mean you are entitled to participate in Orbital and that all other majors are not as deserving of a slot as you. 

On a personal note, it’s really time for the year 1 CS students to realise that’s CS is not all cushy with free swags, flexible working hours and 5 digits intern pay. You have to earn every single one of them. Whining will get you nowhere.   It’s really time to mature up and actually ask yourself what is important to you. While the top students in SoC earn 10+k monthly, the average CS students don’t even earn half of that. It is really time to wake up and reflect on what you really want to do in NUS, learn about the science of computation, or just get an easy 4MC from Orbital.

Firstly, I would like to do an anonymous feedback to our Professors. To start off, I would like to apologise to both of you that I honestly do not know what have been happening in this module for the past 8 weeks. (Even after attending the weekly 2 hours of lecture, 2 hours of lab, 1 hour of tutorial and rewatching Monday and Wednesday's Webcasts)

For the first half of the semester, I felt that the prof does not even care for us.

He conducted his lecture by assuming that all of us already know Java (Object-Oriented Programming) and know how to use Vim. He doesn't fully utilize the lecture notes (Skipping slides here and there) but does a lot of live demos (Using terms that he assumed that we already know). These made our understanding and learning harder.

Yes, I know that we are now young-adults and we should be responsible with our own learning. However, if we need to learn everything on our own by searching on Google, then shouldn't I be paying my school fees to their company?

Next, may I know what is the purpose of attending the weekly 2 hours of lab? Every Tuesday Lab Routine: Arrive lab, => find a PC => login to codecrunch => code for 2 hours => dismiss => (Bring home my code, continue to code and submit by Sunday 23:59). Throughout the routine, my lab tutor assistant does not mention a word (Not even a single instruction, no guildance & no question was answered).

To all current and future lab tutor assistants, we know that you have obtained very good grades. However, if you cannot express yourselves or cannot answer any questions at all, then please do not register to be a TA (DO NOT REGISTER FOR THE $$). We really need people who can help us out!!

Regarding our Practical Assessment 1, both test date and test scope were released very last minutes. On the day itself, our PCs were spoiled and the instructions were not clearly stated. For example, if we were not allowed to change the Main method, why was it stated at the back of the Level?

Understand that the professors will be using their skeleton, Main.java and I have to revert my code as followed. This means that number of lines changed increases. According to this semester professor, they make use of AI to do the marking. Thus, I highly feel that the marking is not fair at all.

My friends knew and kept teasing him when he came to help me with the assignment. I felt embarrassed but also curious about his reaction. He just smiled every time, and I guessed he couldn't do anything more than that as he's doing his job. I put a lot of effort into studying the module and got the highest score in his class, I hoped it could make him notice me that way.

I wanted to tell him when the semester ended, but my insecurity got in the way. He got that cute smile, muscular build, and a much fairer skin tone than mine. This sounded shitty to write out loud, but I kept wondering if I was beautiful enough for him.

I noticed him having dinner alone yesterday and joined him. We caught up and talked about personal stuff for the first time. He jokingly said he wanted to ask me out but somehow thought I had a boyfriend as I posted a lot of pics with my brother on Instagram. I was speechless.

 I confessed to him, but both of us knew it would not go anywhere. I will graduate soon and work overseas while he stays here for at least 3 years. We said goodbye, life went on. I keep fantasizing to be with him, but there is not much I can do now.

Perhaps the coordinator is inexperienced in organising events or is inexperience in disseminating information. But alas, most people who are unable to attend a talk for which had limited seating do not know the registration deadline. In fact, I wanted to sign up at around 9.30pm which we can all agree is a good timing, usually early in fact for most events. 

I have known not very many event organisers who hold a registration in such a matter, in such blitz. It is as he does not know that an event registration usually lasts at least a day. Perhaps, he does not have an event to look up to such as your school of computing camps which has a long deadline for registration. Perhaps, he knows not that 4 hours of registration is not enough.

Your reasons that an event such as this has limited vacancies is odd. You promote that it will broaden the pathways to our future. If you predicted it is popular, why are you not prepared to increase the number of vacancies? Bad preparation on your part. You should not have promoted it so that you can further limit the places available.

The field itself isn't particularly niche or exclusive, but the prof assigned their own papers/chapters from their books to be a large fraction of the module readings, 20+ readings out of a total of ~80. I find this particularly annoying because whenever we discuss those readings in class, the prof always uses the fact that they're the author to shut down any and all opposing interpretations, silencing critical discussion of the issues. Does NUS really give free reign for professors to do this?

1660,"Why is it difficult to take in more students for Orbital? The way I see it, it is easier to scale up than a traditional module held in school.

I took Orbital last year. If the amount of advisor is a problem, you could open up more slots to students, on the condition that they will have no advisor. Heck, when I took orbital last year, the advisor was totally useless. Clueless about iOS programming and could not value add in any way. I am pretty sure many students will be willing enough to take the module despite having no advisor, after all this is an independent learning module. 

If the venue for splashdown is a concern, you could very well choose a bigger venue. An easy fix will be MPSH.

If your server could not handle the load of many projects registered, well... This should not even be a concern at all.

If venues for workshop is a concern, you could very well have more sessions. Or rather, have students sign up on a first come first serve basis. Webcast is a probable solution. Heck, most students are not even interested to attend these workshops. Its an independent learning module. 

So what kind of concerns are there to prevent taking in more students for Orbital? The cohort size is 1k, yet the intake is only 500.

1661,"I am not sure if my observations are legit or am I being too paranoid or over sensitive in this matter. I’m posting here to seek some genuine advice. (Please. No troll) 

Why is 80% of everyone else living a more fulfilling life than I am? That places me in the bottom 20% percentile. I’m not asking to outshine anyone, I average I happy already. I jus want to be “normal”.

Observation 1: 
 I have never done any shopping sprees where I buy so much until my hands are filled with shopping bags, and my bed is never filled with shopping hauls. Never. 80% of everyone else post MASSIVE shopping hauls online. Some even buy so much until the bed fill to the brim with clothes. Like, how? 

Yeah, if u shop at cheap places it’s like $5-$20 per item of clothing, but if you buy around 40 items, that adds up to a $200 spree? Errrr...how come everyone is able to go on this kind of $200 sprees? 

I saw, with my very own eyes, how my average-family girl pal managed to buy so much during shopping that even her suitcase could not close. It’s just.....so full. How? 

 how do normal people just....spend this much until whole hand filled with shopping bags? I never know what a massive shopping spree feels like. 

Observation 2:  
Not only is my wallet and shopping spree (and wardrobe) not full, my heart isn’t full either. I never laugh at jokes, I never laugh at funny things, I pretend to nod and smile just to be polite. I try to appear as if I am amused. I am not, deep inside. 

I envy those who laugh like crazy all the time. There’s nothing remotely funny about ANYTHING that ANYONE says or does. The laughter just doesn’t...flow out. There’s nothing inside. 

Observation 3: 
Not only do I never laugh, I hardly cry buckets either. I’ve seen normal people cry into tissue after tissue, some even filling the whole floor with used tissue when they cry. Some cry at touching movies until their eyes become swollen the next day. Some tear up at wedding proposals because they are overwhelmed by the love. 

Many showcase hose pipe-like tear ducts where tears flow non-stop after a breakup. Their tears, their feelings, just naturally flow so much. 

Why can’t I be the same? I never cry at anything. Nothing matters to me. I always wish one day I can feel so much that the tears naturally flow out (maybe during a movie?) but my insides are so empty. 

You see, NOTHING flows out because my life is coloured by one shade of grey called EMPTY. Money doesn’t flow out naturally during shopping sprees, laughter doesn’t flow out during funny things, and my tears never flow so much. (In fact, hardly?) 

How come I always get the short end of the stick? Am I being paranoid or......?

1663,"Dear management of school of computing,

Recently, I wanted to sign up for the Orbital program. Then I found out that registration started at 4pm and ended at 8.30pm. Perhaps the coordinator is inexperienced in organising events or is inexperience in disseminating information. But alas, most people who are unable to attend a talk for which had limited seating do not know the registration deadline. In fact, I wanted to sign up at around 9.30pm which we can all agree is a good timing, usually early in fact for most events. 

I have known not very many event organisers who hold a registration in such a matter, in such blitz. It is as he does not know that an event registration usually lasts at least a day. Perhaps, he does not have an event to look up to such as your school of computing camps which has a long deadline for registration. Perhaps, he knows not that 4 hours of registration is not enough.

Your reasons that an event such as this has limited vacancies is odd. You promote that it will broaden the pathways to our future. If you predicted it is popular, why are you not prepared to increase the number of vacancies? Bad preparation on your part. You should not have promoted it so that you can further limit the places available. 

Lets not talk about the event organiser’s inadequacies. It is not his fault. We should learn from bad examples. Once in a while such things happen.

She flosses her teeth twice a day and always nags at me to floss, when I told her flossing is a feminine thing she got really upset and pissed off like wtf? Have you even ever heard of men flossing? Other than dentists la but that's cause of their job. There was an instance where we were out with friends and we all split the bill, I discreetly asked her to lend me her credit card so I could pay and not look bad because I didn't have money. She didn't want to and just paid for me nd her share. Do you know how embarrassing it was for me? That night we got into an argument and she told me to get a job if I didn't want this to happen. She doesn't even understand that I'm waiting for the best job opportunity.

Whenever she shower, I will check her phone and I've seen her conversation with friends where they told her to find a better boyfriend. she just replied with ""haha no la"". She didn't even defend me??? She didn't even type some of my pros. 

Another thing is I've tried to ask her to resign because I don't think it's nice for her to be better than me. She should let me have a job first and my position should be higher than hers. If not I will look inferior to her. She was also really upset and I feel like she is not sensitive to my feelings at all.

I've asked her many times if we should get married or do bto but she has kept saying ""never mind la take it slow"" and I feel like she's not serious about us. I've already been so nice to her by waiting for her to marry me and honestly I could get tons of other girls if I wanted. She's so ungrateful and I feel like I should just break with her. Because I'm nice and we've been together for four years I will ask for her hand in marriage one last time. 

Maybe yall can advise me on what to do and why she's trying to make me look like a useless boyfriend. Thks in advance.

First there was the technical issue, which lasted from 4pm when the sign ups opened, all the way till almost 6pm. The website was basically inaccessible at that point in time. Then at the same time, there were caching issues which showed students who were able to load the site that the sign ups were closed even when it was open. 

Secondly, on the same day, from 6pm to 8pm, majority of the CS students had a CS2100 paper. This basically means that there was a two hour period where this group didn't have a chance to sign up. After the paper ended, we almost immediately got notified that the sign ups were closed. That isn't even close to fair is it, when basically half of SoC don't even get a chance at all to sign up.

Considering that this is something that only first years get the chance to do, I have a huge issue with how the sign ups were handled.

We've been best friends since secondary school, although we couldn't be more different. She's pretty enough to have done modelling while I'm extremely plain, tall while I'm quite short, smart enough to be a comfortable FCH while I'm struggling to maintain a second upper. She's outgoing and sociable while I'm quiet and shy, has multiple exco positions while I'm a phantom. She's attractive enough to be practically deciduous while I remain sadly evergreen. She even has C-cup while I could run around topless and be mistaken for a guy. She has several other circles of friends, so I don't know why she hangs out with me so much. 

Yet despite all this, she's never been anything but the best of friends for me, helping me cope through the stress of uni life and listening to me when I call her with a 3am crisis. But recently, I've been feeling this unexplainable jealousy, because she's better than me in just about everything. The only thing I can do that she can't is play the piano. Sometimes, in my darker moods, I think that she's only friends with me because I make her look far better in comparison. How do I stop myself from having these thoughts of jealousy?

I was born outside of singapore and moved here after my parents came here to work and I would say it’s pretty sad to see how all that an average person thinks about is BTO/starting pay/CPF/wedding cost/getting a car/have one great vacation a year. This seems to be the aspirations of majority of the people I know or have seen. Not saying any of these are wrong goals to have. But ultimately the only thing that you are chasing is making sure you have enough money to be safe and stable. You sell your soul to a company for the rest of your life just so that you can work hard and even harder just to afford these things which are incredibly overpriced here. The only source of fun is like one vacation you’re gonna take per year. Thinking about the future prospects in this country makes me question the purpose of even having a life. I have decided that I will move out of this country right after I graduate and be in a place that has humans who chase after happiness. And It’s ok if that country isn’t as stable and safe as Singapore but as long as the only thing I’m looking forward to is not how I’m gonna settle all by BTO balances and car loans I’ll be glad. I feel like we all are surrounded by like minded people who chase after the same goals and we end up choosing to stay in the safe path and live the same kind of life. Success is easily just defined by which car/house you own. It’s ultimately the mindset we have all cultivated as a result of society. I just feel so unsatisfied thinking

1676,"Being an introvert in a school assigned group of extroverts is difficult. At first I tried adapting myself when around them, being more enthusiastic, blah blah. But I realised two things. 

One, while I adapted to the way they shaped the group dynamics, they did not do the same for me. It was constantly me trying to fit in with them, than vice versa. It's very tiring. 

Two, even though I attempted to 'code switch' around them, they didn't seem receptive to me. There have been many instances, where whether intentionally or not(probably the latter), I have felt divided from the group. 

Little instances of social rejection, which though minor, do add up over the months. For instance, in a group conversation, never addressing me or looking at me even though i participate. Or another one, when we gather at the lab, one of the guys closes the circle of people standing around the bench, even though i am behind him, and i end up physically blocked from whatever is happening. Another one today: attendance sheet being passed around, one of them passes their pen to another group mate so he can sign. When it is my turn, they pass the sheet to me without even looking at me. As i reach for the pen and hold it, they grab it back wordlessly. I use my own pen. Yet another: Some people start laughing about something, I ask what's going on. Guy just looks at me and away. Little things that will sting anybody. I'm sure many would at this point just give up trying to fit in. And I choose to believe they probably don't do those things consciously. 

I understand that our personalities do not match. We don't need/want to be best buddies and hang out together, but i am trying to be a respectful group member. It's not easy for me either to try to fit in. Maybe it's partly the way I interact too of course. I can be reserved and a little awkward. I'm a bit older than them. I'm sure these extroverts find it exhausting/uncomfortable to chat with me and would rather chat within themselves. Fair enough, I don't mind and that would be good for me too. If they want to grab a drink by themselves sure i hope they have a great time. But ignoring or excluding someone in the same group is just...not a nice thing to do. 

I'm alright with it, more or less, because I realise it's not my problem and I need to be confident in myself. Today I just stopped trying to adapt to them to fit in, and had a really nice time in class. Much better than trying to fit in. I was my quiet self and had my break alone with a book and a coffee. It was nice to just do my own thing. The rest of the group looked like they had a good time too, so it was a win win. I know it's unusual to prefer spending break time alone vs chatting with a large bunch of people over food, but that's the way I've always been. And I think as I grow older, I'm learning to embrace that. 

Disclaimer: They are really smart, driven, kind people, as evidenced by...well a whole lot. This is just my perspective. Maybe I am somehow being the weird one here in the way I look/act/speak/am? Maybe I am being overly sensitive? Who knows. Just something I have been mulling over.

Also, like any normal human being, we all tend to forget some stuff and need a bit of reminder beforehand. Instead they are expecting us to do EVERYTHING, asking my supervisor for the required content and churn out a good report in ONE day?! This is ridiculous. It's not even that hard to just tweak the email reminder system to send out another reminder 3 days or 1 week before.

Ridiculous. You could had just put the link to your guidelines which is on another website on the submission page.

When I asked my mentor about the guidelines of the report, he simply shot the arrow to the Engineering Internship Department without offering ANY form of assistance. And thanks Engineering Internship Department, accusing me of not taking responsibility as a student. NUS is supposed to at least remind us on these deadlines that are not even within the company. You call this preparing students for the working world?! More like, you are just giving students extra stress from dropping a surprise bomb.

I find it unfair that we have to pick up the extra workload and slack of the males when they go on reservist... and there is no extra pay for that... 

Is this the norm and something we should expect?

1701,"A couple of years back when I first met you, I pretended that I wasn’t interested in knowing you. Even though I wanted to get closer to you, I pretended to treat you like any other. Through those years of knowing you, I slowly became closer to you. 

From starting small talks to actual conversations, from talking about having supper to having actual suppers. Eventually we became, or at least I regarded you as, close friends. 

Though we didn’t actually go out a lot, those supper did the trick. Eventually I managed to ask you out, to this festival I’ll never forget. Ever since then, I realised that, I’ve fallen in love with you. It some how feels painful as I knew it was unrequited love, yet stubborn me didn’t want to acknowledge it because I knew that my fragile heart couldn’t take it. 

Days passed by, we had countless of talkative nights, sharing everything and every problems under the moonlight. I tried to think of you as just another Friend but it was getting overly awkward for me. I knew from the beginning that, I’d fall in love with you someday. When your eyes met mine, I knew I had to say, the 3 words that I hoped to hear you say.  I know I was a coward, I confessed through a letter. But I couldn’t help it, as I knew the answer would be. The thought of the word coming through your mouth, made me realise that I couldn’t stay. I gave you the letter not hoping for a yes, but for you to know of my feelings and that we can still be friends. That didn’t happen, I’ve yet to hear from you since then, it’s been a couple of months now and I’m wondering if it’s time to move on.

1703,"Need some advice guys.

I’ve been working for about 2.5 years now. After graduating, I joined a graduate programme in Finance with a large global MNC. Benefits were good there, and the organizational culture was great. People were genuinely nice and I got on very well with almost everyone I worked with. Work was mostly comprised of classroom learnings and small group projects with my fellow graduate trainees as well as overseas rotation stints. It got pretty boring because I didn’t really do anything value-added until my final overseas rotation when I got really hands-on with budgeting and Business Intelligence. People liked me because I was really good with automation of work through programming, and was doing really well, I was noticed by my mentors and the senior managers throughout the company. Because of this, the company decided to send me to a remote country with limited internet connectivity in a permanent role as a Data Analyst, to launch the business there. I didn’t want to go, plus the role was not even in Finance or FP&A related. So when another large firm headhunted me, I jumped at the opportunity without thinking.

It turned out to be a mistake. The new role (based in Singapore) was so routine even though it was FP&A. I hardly needed to analyse anything, it was more of a reporting role, and systems were so limited in capabilities that it created extra work. Company was toxic in culture, my boss didn’t mentor me the same way my previous boss did, and I was left to figure things out myself. Although my learning curve was steep, I was sickened to the gut with the stupidity of the business philosophy (that of extreme cost cutting, with no focus on topline revenue growth). People were not as receptive towards improvement or automation, and I was told not to rock the boat. So 6 months in, I resigned.

It took me a couple of months to find another job, being a bit more selective this time. I’m currently 3 weeks into my next role, a commercial business partner in a growing start up. The role is fulfilling, and I do a lot more financial modelling work (which I love). Everything is great here, except one downside: my boss.

This guy came from an investment banking background, and is super demanding. He even explicitly said that if I’m not prepared to work overnight and on weekends, then this role is not for me. I’m always kept on my toes and neglecting family and friends just to keep up with his expectations. He sends chaser emails and whatsapp texts all through the day. I work 14 hours a day, and too afraid to even break for lunch. I guess I am struck with so much fear because this job is important to me (I cannot do another short term tenure again). 3 weeks in and I am exhausted, my heart beats so fast from the intensity and pace of my boss. 2 weeks ago I couldn’t deliver 1 forecast projection and he lashed out via an angsty email. So I squeezed more hours to deliver the week after and yet he was less than impressed. With so much to catch up on the new business and being overwhelmed with information and deadlines, I really don’t know how long I can last. I will still try my best, but I have been doing so since I joined. Any advice on what I should do? Change my mentality or something?

1705,"OP of #59830 here

I wish people would stop misreading posts and assuming everyone's life story-- this should apply to every post. It's puzzling bc nowhere did I say I find part-tine jobs disrespectable, I said my parents find it disrespectable, and I even put the word disrespectable in air quotes. 

Even more bizarre is the assumption that I get 750 a month, or that I spend all of that on alcohol and clubbing. I do spend on alcohol, but I'm a very light drinker, I eat two meals a day, and I don't club. Whatever is leftover, I save it up, because if my parents ever find out I'm gay, they will kick me out, so I need some money to tide me over while finding a job. 

I also make extra money from experiments and freelance work because I can hide those income-generating activities. 

But you know what? Why should have to explain myself so thoroughly- my diet, my freelance work, even my sexuality? Why do people assume the worst, the most ""privileged and entitled"" of people who dont have a part-time job, especially when it is because their parents won't let them? I don't agree with my parents, but most parents have their idiosyncrasies. Do you turn the house upside-down for every little thing you don't agree with them about? 

I'd hate to pull the ""asian values"" card, but I'd thought people here would know what it means to try for family harmony. And don't assume and judge when you almost never know a person's full story.

While  NUS wants to keep its grades and degree valuable, colleges such as HYP seems to have grade inflation and still are wonderful. Companies all want and prefer FCH so isn't it not the duty of NUS to give out more? 

I think that forcing students into a bell curve isn't good at all as it makes everyone more competitive and less collaborative. College is a place to learn, but ends up with people who just try to game the system of trying to get the grades while forgetting what they learn the following sem. Professors should set reasonable papers instead of making the paper too easy or hard and then use the bell curve as it doesn't do anyone any good.

Many people around me have them too and while at first I offered to be a listening ear, it started to get VERY taxing. Until the negativity drowns me and I can't wait to get away from them.

But it's possible to survive and pull through. It took years but I'm so much better now. Maybe you can do it too. Just please. Remember that your friends are not your free counsellor. I know it's tough but don't make it so hard for others to stay with you. Don't make others your crutch. No one can help you if you keep refusing help.

I agree that self-sufficiency is important but everyone's situation is different. For example, my parents do not let me take any part-time job because they considered those ""disrespectable"". They make a lot of money themselves, so giving me an allowance is barely anything to them. I know quite a few other schoolmates with similar parents. 

Yes it is possible for me to fight this issue with my parents, and get kicked out, and then fully support myself with a part-time job. For what? A sense of pride, while barely getting by on meagre wages, working hours that might pull down my CAP and force me to abandon my resume-building activities? Falling out with parents because I don't want to take their money would be absolutely ridiculous. 

So if you know anyone who takes an allowance instead of working, don't just assume they are spoiled and selfish. Some of us just don't see the point of severing family ties over a sense of pride.

There's a catch. The reason that I'm so comfortable being together with him because he shared with me that he's looking for a gf that has the same religion with him. And since I don't follow that religion, I felt reassured that I was out of his dating pool. Hence, i have always truly treated him as a friend and nothing else, despite my other friends occasional teasing of us being a couple.

However, i wonder why, but something changed. It feels as if suddenly, he no longer puts in any effort in our friendship anymore. He no longer jios me out for lunch and we no longer pm each other. It's a gradual process since I still made an effort to pm him and ask him how are his deadlines etc. But his replies, from one to two sentences, becomes single word replies. When I tell him about my worries, he gives nothing than a mere sticker.
I wonder what has happened. We definitely didn't have a big argument or sth like that, but somehow we just fall apart. It's really sad. I consider the possibility of him getting a gf but if he did, he could have told me and i would keep my distance understandably, though initially we were also not that close together.

What happened? It was a cool friendship and it's just suddenly gone. What should I do? What's happened to him for him to treat me that way?

Does anyone feels e same way 
It irks me when people dun activate blue tick on their WhatsApp. And it is even worst if you dun bother replying or give super late reply few days later 

I’m totally fine if you read my msg on e same day but reply few days later and I would know cause blue tick will tell me that you have read it 

But when e contacts dun activate e blueticks and dun reply I’m like how do I know if e msg has been send and received. Are u still there or has sth happen 

Which brings me to the next point 
The reason why people dun activate blue ticks is because people in general expect their friend to reply instantly after all we live in e age of instant gratification and how long does it take to reply to a text msg right? 

But we forget get the world doesn’t revolve around us and our friends/ gf/bf/ best friend does not need to reply us instantly if they think e matter can wait. 

I know of friends whose partner read their text on the same day but reply four to 5 days later. 

But thanks to blue tick tech at least e sender has known tt e msg has been read. 

Cause there are people out there who just dun like to use their phone tt much. 

So to confessor #59720. Since ur bf doesn’t reply instantly to his friends too it does shows tt he dun like to reply instantly tt often. But if he still shows up and meeting and spend time with you tt good 

So ask yourself if this really bothers u tt much to e extend of breaking up, what are some compromise tt you guys can come up with. 

Cause I honestly feel it is a trival but important issue and if you guys dun communicate about it how are u guys doing to stay together through other issues and difficulties faced. 

Lack of communication is one of the reason why breakups happen. But what does a evergreen  person in my 20s know.

1727,"Hi all, looking for an advice here..

I and my bf are in ldr rn. He goes to NUS and I go to another overseas uni. We’re both aren’t Singaporean and we’ve been best friends ever since our high school days. We just got to be more than that last year, after being bffs for around 3 years. So I can safely say I know him quite well by now.

He’s always been that smart competitive guy even since our HS days, being in the top 5 of his class, and also got accepted to NUS (which is kinda a big deal back in our home country). He’s now an engineering student with a high CAP (read: FCH) and also managing quite a lot of CCAs. Despite that, he still tries to make time to call me at night (ldr problems) even when he has midterms coming etcetc.

However, lately I’ve been feeling like things change. Majority of our talks now is him talking nonstop abt internships and his friends actually getting an internship here and there achieving this and that, with me just listening to him talk for hours. I’m suppotive of him and his dreams, but I just can’t help feeling like we’re moving at a different pace and that I just couldn’t keep up with him. Here where I study, the life is more laid back (?) and ppl do talk abt jobs and internships etc but the intensity is just so different from what I hear it’s like there in Singapore (he told me that everyday he would be talking abt internships with his friends).

Now it feels like I’m more like his ‘job consultant’ rather than a gf, where mostly he talks abt is work and that he asks for my advice in addressing certain issues. He doesn’t actually talk abt things ‘normal couples’ would  talk abt. I don’t mind listening to him talk abt his internships etc however I just think that it shouldn’t take up like 70% of everything that we talk abt. I know that we’re still young and being ambitious is a good thing that will get you far, however I can’t help but feel pressured by all these talk abt work. I’ve been way more stressed lately due to his ‘talks’, since even tho he didn’t explicitly say this,  the “if you’re not able to be in the same level as me, then you’re not that worthy” kind of feeling he gives me just pressurize me much. 

He already gets the internship from this relatively big company, but he still says that he want to get an inten from this super big company. He’s the kind of guy that thinks if someone else can do something, so can he. His level of competitiveness scare me sometimes. He also ask me to just work in Singapore after I graduate this year (as if it’s that easy lol) so that we don’t have to be in ldr but seeing him like that makes me hesitant abt the potential super stressful life I’ll be in if I were to work there. He’s always talking abt being a CEO will get you lots of $$ etcetc but tbh I’m not the kind of person that actually wants a life so full of riches but having my SO work almost 24/7 and not able to spend time with me. Smh. Idk but  being with him makes me feel small and unworthy. 

 I always hear that Singapore life is competitive but is it really that bad that all 2nd yr uni ppl talk abt with their friends is mostly internships and work? He’s actually of the same age as me but I’ll be graduating earlier than him and hopefully start work earlier as well. Will this issues be any better once I start being in the work force?

Thoughts regarding this matter? He wasn’t this crazy up until the mid of last year and I don’t know how long I can keep up with all this stress from being with him ☹️ He’s actually a very kind person and I know he loves me too, we just clicked so well during our HS days up until his 1st year in NUS, then he just somehow transformed into this ambi guy I don’t recognize. I don’t want to breakup with him just bcs of this but I can’t actually feel happy if I were to be in a long term relationship with someone that’s too ambitious. It just feels like he’s no longer the boyfriend and bff I used to know that shares the same vision as me.

I already tried talking to him regarding this matter. He said he’s going to lessen the work talks, but after a week or so at most he’s just back to this super ambi boy mode. Sigh.

And for K if you somehow reads this,
really, I miss those old days that I can talk to you abt anything at anytime, not just me here trying so hard to impress you just to be able to feel worthy for you. I was happy with you back then, where did all those happiness go?

1728,"My boyfriends take forever to reply messages, for example, maybe 3 days to just reply to one WhatsApp. The longest he went without texting or replying me is probably 10 over days, before his fyp submission deadline. I mean, I can understand that cos it's probably a very busy and stress period. But I think he might be losing interest or that he's just taking me for granted like you know how some guys just wants the chase and not want to be responsible for the relationship after. When we started dating, he's very quick with his replies like we can have proper conversations over text and now we would just text each other to ask where and when we would be meeting. It'll usually be me asking if we're meeting on this day, where and what time, and he'll take maybe a couple of days to reply (which is usually the night before we meet)  and the cycle repeats. Now that I've said it, it kind of reminds me of business policies of needing a couple of business days to process lol. 

Anyway I talked to him about it, but he just brushes it off in a not-so-serious tone and saying how he hates using his phone and all. It is true that he doesn't uses his phone when we go out and there will be tons of unopened notifications from his friends. I guess I'll be trying to talk to him this for the last time and hope that maybe we can either come to a compromise in some way (since we've been together for almost a year now) or... maybe it's for the best to end things early to spare us from further pain in the future. 

Anyone has been in the same situation and can offer some advice for how to talk about such problems face to face? I've tried, but the thing is I'm very happy to see him every time we meet so it's tough for me to talk about it and he's really nice and considerate towards me when we meet up?
