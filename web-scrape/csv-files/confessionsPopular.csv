Whereas in Singapore, most of the females are pretty flat. I am just really curious if this is a genetics thing, or could it be the food and environment the americans were brought up in? Serious qn, no bashing pls..

2,"I need some advice on what to do. Or what and how to talk to my boyfriend. I feel that he is becoming a talk-only-no-action guy. Just some background: We have been together for over 2 years. Everything is close to perfect. He treats me well, his family dotes on me, financially stable, etc. My biggest concern is the issue of ""only words no action"". I will list a few scenarios below.

When I first get to know him, he said that his dream was to own a car to drive his family around because they have never had a car. I thought that was really sweet and filial. But now, whenever I asked when will he be getting his driving license, he will say that he has no time. He said that we often meet a few times a week, and his weekends is to accompany me. I said that driving lessons is only 1-2hours. It's only that short time, I don't think it will make a big difference in our meeting schedule (not that we have a fixed schedule to begin with). And of course I'm willing to compromise to meet him lesser if he has other commitments.

When he first met my parents, he told them that he has the intention to study MBA part time. I thought that was really awesome because he has ambition. But, when I asked him about the MBA plans, he said that it is very expensive. I said maybe can see if his company is willing to sponsor and he stay for a few more years. He said, no because he wanted to change job. (Until now, he is at the same job and not actively finding jobs. It's been over a year since he said that.)

We wanted to buy a resale HDB. I went to do a lot of research on the purchase process, check various property websites, calculate our loan eligibility and shortlisted many houses to discuss with him. I told him, we have to start to contact agents to do house viewing, because the viewing process will take many months. But he said he will need to call the bank to confirm our loan limit before we do viewing so we will know our limits. Ok, so I waited. And waited. It's been more than 6months, so I told him that we need to resume finding house. I got upset because my prior effort was down the drain as the houses that I shortlisted would either be sold or prices changed. So he said that he will call the bank. The last time we talked about it was a month ago, still nothing done. I really don't know what to expect anymore.

There are more similar scenarios. Some are big issues, some are more trivial ones. I need to remind him multiple times before he does it. Recently I went to a wedding dinner, and told him some beautiful things that happened at the wedding. He said, 'you know I will do all these for you too right?' I just smile and nod. But deep down, I really don't have anymore expectations.

When I try to seek advice from my friends, the females and males gave very different response.

The females will ask me to hint him once in a while and try to talk to him whether he has anything holding him back. When I do that, he got pissed and say, 'ok. I will do later ok?' I did ask him if there are any reasons for him not doing those things. As mentioned above, some are about money and spending time with me. I tried to give alternative solutions but still no action taken.

As for my male friends, they will say that I'm asking too much of him and causing him to feel stressed. They said I should give him space and let him do things at his own pace. Actually, I did give him a lot of time. I don't mind if the process is slow, but all I'm asking for is a bit of progress. To me, it's not about the duration of completing the thing. I'm more concerned that the thing is either status quo for a long time, or didn't even start.

I may sound a bit shallow for this part. After getting together, he gained weight. Even his mom secretly told me to encourage him to exercise more as she realized that he gained a lot of weight. I did tell him to exercise more and he will say 'I know lah'. When I suggest to go run together, he refused because he is unglam. His physique makes me less and less willing to be intimate with him. 

Maybe his words-no-action attitude is also part of the reason for feeling less attracted to him. It's like having those colourful expectations which he portrayed but he did not do anything to achieve it.
I feel that as a couple, we must have goals and move together towards the goals. I just feel tired to be the only one trying to move forward.

It was raining pretty heavily. As I was getting off the bus at KR, I noticed this guy holding up his umbrella after he alighted onto the platform. At first, I thought he was waiting for his friends, but turns out he was holding the umbrella for everyone getting off! My friend and I got off the bus without getting wet and cold.

He is a really nice guy. He is nice to the girls all around him and always watching out for me. I didn’t really give much thought about it when he was nice to me, because I always thought he treated me well because he retarded me as a xiaomeimei. He takes care of the people around him very well. Even though my friends always tease him about me (when I’m not around), he always say no. There were also many times he said he is not ready for a relationship at this stage, he hasn’t gotten about his ex, and he is just figuring out his life right now. 

From my understanding of his personality, i’m just afraid that he mixed up his care and concern for me as a xmm for romantic feelings. 

I understand that he has been through a few bad relationships, and I do as well. Both of us are looking for a good and nice partner. And I really wish I could sort this out with him. I think it’s only fair, for him and me, to know each other feelings. 

How should I raise this up to him? I feel like both of us are really not ready for this. The guy, being the kind and nice guy, would definitely deny it. I don’t know what to do.

1) I deposit as much as I can from a part of my salary in standard chartered 's jump-start account. Have about $7k inside right now. 

2) just  started using stashaway and looking at investing at ETF, corporate bonds etc, giving a projected income of 3.75% per Annum. 
Besides this, I also have the cash management portion offered by stashaway called StashAway Simple ,which offers me 1.9% per annum interest. 

The reason why I am looking forward to diversify and earn more money is not only for personal use(travelling with my friends to overseas, getting braces for myself, driving lesson etc), but I really want to be ahead of my peers. I realise that financial literacy is something not a lot of people around the 20s will have, and if I gain a bit of extra info and can use if to share with my friends, I guess they will be happy to get out of the rat race here in Singapore. Work life had been rough, and I hope that things are getting better for me at least.

14,"Sorry, long post ahead.

I'm tired of feeling lonely. I don't really have any clique I belong to nor have I had a close friend, for as long as I could remember. 

In primary school, I was constantly bullied. Nobody really liked me, or at least I felt that way. All I could remember was having lunch alone because no one wanted to have lunch with me. Maybe I could also tell from the fact that my class photo during Primary 6 had two versions: one with everyone visibly seen, that was given to me, and another without me in it, given to everyone else in the class.

In secondary school, I've decided to not let my past affect me and tried to make new friends. Sure, I've made casual friends but none I felt connected to. I never get invited to hang out with friends after school and when I was the one doing the invite, everyone suddenly became busy.

In poly, I've had groups of friends that I hang with during classes, but I've always felt like the outside. It was obvious that my friends had their inside jokes and stories. I could still remember the day I felt heartbroken after finding out that we had 2 WhatsApp groups, one with me and another without. That was probably the first time I started to wonder if there's anything wrong with me all this while. Am I annoying? Am I boring? Am I unlikeable? 

NUS days were when things started to feel exponentially worse. I didn't join camps as I was still in NS during that time. So, when I started my first week in NUS, everyone I saw was already in a clique of their own. Maybe it was the anxiety in me or my past experience with people, but I did not dare to approach anyone in class. I'm always sitting alone in lectures and tutorial classes. In between classes, I have my meals in canteen by myself, watching students walk by. At the end of the day, I'm just on the MRT on the way home. Sure, I've interacted with others during group projects, but the interactions stop there. After my last exam paper of every semester, I would watch people talking about going out to celebrate and all I did was just going home and celebrating by myself. I remembered 'celebrating' on my own after my first semester by eating alone at a restaurant. I also remembered crying myself to sleep that night. 

Having been in my first job for about 6 months, I've never felt lonelier. Sure, I'm friends with some of my colleagues but like my previous phases in life, I've felt that the level of friendship is imbalanced. I'm always trying so hard to be close to them, but I know they don't feel as close. Maybe I'm too clingy. Maybe I'm trying too hard that it scares them away. My current routine is just going to work and going home and the cycle repeats. No telegram/WhatsApp messages. No random conversations with friends. No chats with family members at home (We're not very close). I do make the initiative to meet up with friends sometimes, but it rarely happens. 

I’ve tried out new activities/hobbies to distract myself, but the loneliness has recently felt overwhelming. I wanted to try getting to know new people through meetup groups, but I'm so afraid to do so now. 26 years of loneliness has made me feel that I'm terrible at friendships. Every new person I meet is going to be a friend for that phase of my life and just leave afterwards. I try so hard not to have that mentality with every new person I meet but that has always been end result. The weird thing is that a lot of people I've met mentioned things like ""You're so friendly"", ""Why are you so nice?"", ""You're such an easy person to talk to"" but now I'm wondering if all these are just white lies. Maybe they're just statements to cover up for something terrible about me? I'll never know because we don't talk anymore.

I guess the reason why I'm bringing this up recently is because I'm starting to notice changes to myself. I've been getting much more exhausted and unmotivated with more things in life. I tend to stutter whenever I speak now, and my command of language is becoming pretty bad. I know I need help. As I don't have close friends to talk to, I wanted to share it here just to let someone know. Anyone.

I'm tired of feeling lonely. To those I’ve met before, I'm sorry if I was a terrible person to be friends with. To everyone else, please give me a chance.

Lately when I was eating alone at canteen, one team mate saw me and he decided to join my table and we ate together. (Im a girl and Im sure he is not interested in me since he forgotten we had lunch together the next time we chatted).

That was when I realized the joy of having someone to have meal with. These days when I see people sitting alone playing phone, I really have the urge to join the table and strike a conversation but I worry that people (especially guys) may think I have other intention...

16,"Went to Jewel Coffee to buy a latte. While lining up, someone tapped on my shoulder from behind, it was a guy with a beautiful girl besides him. I didn’t recognised the guy at first until I asked him if I knew him. He mentioned his name and introduced the girl besides him as his gf, suddenly the world dark for a while. He’s a guy from the same jc as me and he was my best friend. The fact that I forgot about him bcoz something had happened during college time. We were in the same water polo team and went for quite a number of tournaments. To make it fast forward, we were about to go on our own path, I ended up in NUS while he went to oversea to study.

Few days before he fly, he stayed at my home, had a few drinks, talked a lot on sports and out of nowhere, we ended up staring at each other. It was the time where I do realised he is such a fine guy, perhaps the most good looking guy I had ever seen that time. The fact that I never had a feelings to any guys but I don’t even know why he came into me. The basorexic feelings killing me, staring at his luscious lips, moving away my sight immediately after.

Out of sudden, his hand pulling my neck and brought my face near to his, ended up kissing each other. His lips so soft that I don’t even want to cut the kiss. We ended up cuddled on my bed while he was kissing me hardly. I never knew that the raging hormone of this young guy so strong. Maybe because we were drunk at that time but the fact that I able to remember each moment until now, I don’t think I am. We never talked about that night since then and we ended up losing in contact after.

Back to present, I was immersed in those memories until he called me by my name and asked me whether I am okay. I am okay after all these years without him. He asked me why I never in contact with him all these while and I don’t even know how to answer it. ‘It is good to see you, it has been a while’. It was an awkward short conversation, he was the one who is excited and I am blunt as always. We never talked about past time as I don’t want to think about it anymore. The fact that he is having a gf now, it is time for him to be happy. 

I ended up ordered my drink and sat somewhere else. He and his gf sat quite far from my table. Suddenly, a waiter came to me and handed a plate of croissant. I never ordered it but the waiter told me that the guy in white shirt ordered for me, He is my friend from earlier on and I looked at him from far, he looked at me and gave me a good smile. The waiter handed me together with a small notes given by my friend.

“I miss you”
“Text me later: xxxx xxxx”

There goes the love triangle. Should I contact him again?

I need to understand how is dating culture around Singapore, as I’ve met this local girl here through a dating app and we met a few times, but I’m not sure if it is just friendly gatherings or if they are actually dates. I feel nervous whenever I want to make an advance in any locals, as my home country’s dating culture is way more casual than what I know from here (for reference: if you don’t kiss at the first date it usually means that you don’t want anything with the person and sex is seen as something casual after a few dates). In sum, I feel kinda scared to make any moves as they might be taken as harassment/aggressive by some people even though I definitely don’t mean to do something like that.

I am really still a virgin girl. I sleep with teddy bears and dolls in my bed. I never got hugged to sleep. I never hugged a living,breathing human being to sleep. I never cuddled with anybody under a cosy blanket. My life is always super simple, I just go to school study, graduate, and work in an office (of course I’m not saying where I found employment as this is strictly anonymous) and I never check anyone’s text messages but my own. 

Is this why (not sure why, that’s why I’m asking, it’s open to discussion really!) I have “no feelings”? 

I feel nothing. Nothing! 

Other girls with sexual encounters already are extremely different from me. They naturally bawl their eyes out at sad romantic movies, while I can’t understand what romance is. They just feel touched enough to cry whenever something sad/moving happens between the man and woman on film. All these complex emotions.......while I’m trying my best to feel what it’s like to be even loved in the first place??? 

I watched as those with proper boyfriends check on their texts to make sure they aren’t cheating/texting their exes? But I don’t have a single shred of love in my life, so I don’t get why people can get so paranoid? Some even worry about their boyfriend not texting back in a minute (?!) and I’m like.....sometimes my sister doesn’t reply for the whole day and I’m like okay with it? 

But I don’t like myself this way. I desperately Want to change. I want to stop being someone with no feelings. I want to experience love too. 

I am on dating apps but no stranger ever asked me to even meet for a one night stand. I also go clubbing but Nobody asked me to go home with them after clubbing. 

Hypothetically speaking, if let’s say I begin to go on one night stands and actually have some form of skinship, I will also experience what love and romance are right? When it comes to songs and movies, will  I also feel so touched that I cry? 

I really never cried at a single song or movie before. What can I do about this?

She can’t understand my point of view when it comes from me, however she’ll be more understanding when she speaks to her friends about it.  She does have valid reasons for everything, and I can understand her point of view. But I am just not comfortable with losing control of everything that I do. We are both on equal footing in our jobs, and I’m starting to lose sight on why it’s worth sacrificing everything I find important to me to be with her. I have and am willing to compromise on things that are important to me as I know a relationship takes two to make it work. But to what extent? She’s always there for me, as I am for her. I support everything she does and everything she wants. I’ll rarely say no as I want her to be happy. But it’s always a no when it comes to me on issues she disagrees. When I do disagree with her, she gets upset but does  have reasonable reasons for it. But I just want to do something that I want to sometimes.

When you didn't seem very excited about the present I got you on your birthday, I thought it was stress from work. Who knew that you would break up with me just a mere 2 days later? 

When you were an hour late for our meet up, I thought it was just you having fun with your friends. Who knew that you would break up with me that day? 

When you told me you were troubled and asked for my advice, I thought it was you trying to work things out with me. Who knew that you would break up with me within the hour? 

So many red flags and well, I blame myself for not noticing them earlier. 

The reason you gave for the break up was vague - you needed space, you needed time.

Fast forward 2 months later, you're ignoring me on every platform possible, not even replying my new year wishes. I guess that's the end of the relationship then. Goodbye, and good luck.

She couldn't buy it for me because she rather spend the money on more useful stuff. I didn't get much toys when I was young either. I played with books that my Sister read. I only got two toys when I was young. A toy car and a mini cashier. I still had it till today. My army mates asked me about the stories of those Disney cartoons. I couldn't answer because my Mum didn't subscribe to any disney channels as I was not well to do. So I watch Channel 8 dramas and that was my childhood. They said I got no childhood, laughed at me for not knowing what they were talking about. I have childhood. My childhood was so much better than you. My dad brought my to fishing. My mum brought me for window shopping. My sister going on a breakfast with me on a Saturday. I am always rich, because I have my family constantly by my side. I do not need to substitute solitude with cartoons because my family are always there. Dont say I got no childhood. In fact, you are the one without.

34,"Since i was 13 i was bullied for my looks and i was deemed as unattractive thru out my whole secondary school life, once i had a crush said to someone that he would be with me if i was at least average looking. I heard that and it was like a stab in the wound tbh, back then i really hated how i look and would stare in the mirror scratching my face trying to peel it off  or at least hope for a miracle to look decent. Fast forward to poly life i started wearing makeup and dress provocatively to make myself look at least average but suddenly i was labeled as ""hot"" or ""cute"" and it was really nice to hear those compliments tbh. i started having my first bf and 7 more exes which instanly boost my self esteem up and i was more confident in admitting that i was goodlooking however i was never arrogant about it and i would often compliement how people look too. It was nice for a while until i met my recent friends who are a group of guys they are judgemental and mean and would often judge girls if they are goodlooking or not and thats basically what i see most guys do as well. It made me really upset when they say stuff like "" ur bf has a low libido because his with u"" or "" my ex was cute unlike (my name)"" ik its just their opinon but im really sensitive to how people comment on my looks and its killing me to know im back to how unattractive i was again. How can i learn to love myself seriously and not care what other people think.

I confessed to you last year and you rejected and the ensuing awkwardness started to kill our friendship. I assured you that everything was okay but it's quite obvious that our friendship is dying. We stopped voicecalling on discord and we rarely chatted except on a few rare occasions. I was at least glad to see that you were enjoying yourself but internally I was agonising deeply because I couldn't spend time with you. You promised to go to the arcade during the holidays and even watch a few movies but the promises were unkept. I was devastated because each day I looked forward to you inviting me out which never happened. Perhaps I wasn't as important a friend that I thought I was to you. I couldn't tell you these because it's just my anxiety and I shouldn't trouble you with these. 

Recently you asked why I was being weird towards you. I like you and I know that I can never be with you. I have no idea what to do in this situation. Every moves I make feel like a losing one. Maybe all these are just another case of me overthinking. I just don't know what to do.

38,"To my dearest ex,

This shall be the last you hear of me and the proof of my feelings.

I know our relationship is always unstable, we would always fight and argue about something for hours or maybe days. Sometimes, we would block each other and not talk to each other for days but we will always come back like nothing has happened and continue our relationship and be more loving than before. 

We got together on the 7th of july 2019, it was me who added you on Facebook several months before we got together. When I was still recovering from a painful breakup, I had a crush on your best friend because he was just there when I needed someone since the first day I broke up with that guy. Which, I mistook that as love when I was just feeling lonely. But it was only you who was truly there for me and supported me when I was at my lowest. Most days we would talk until morning and you would constantly cheer me up. You would play games with me even though you're out at your friends house. I could hear your friend through the mic asking who you're playing with and you said my name. Even though I had feelings for your best friend and there was a love triangle between us, you still did your very best to be there for me. 

I remembered that, there was a time where you dozed off on ur pmd late at night while riding and I got super upset and worried about you. That was probably the first time I realised my feelings but chose to ignore it because I wasn't sure.

Soon, the three of us met and by that time, I was positive that the person I have feelings for is you. I was nervous when I was in the MRT, it would be our first meeting. I didn't know what to do. It has been a while since I was that nervous to meet somebody. Fast foward; We got together shortly after that, one day before I went back to my country and regretted it because we didn't spend as much time together. Though it was an uneasy start and we faced through numerous obstacles together and with that I can say I'm satisfied.

The best memory I had, would be when I took a bus straight from KL to SG after my finals and stayed at your place for two weeks without my parent's knowledge. I used up all my savings for that which totalled up around 2K myr. But it's all worth it after seeing you. After all, you've worked hard and have also invested a lot of your time, money, effort in me and up until now I don't feel worthy of it. Being in a ldr with you makes me realise how much I missed you when I went back to my hometown. 

Someone once said to me when I was getting over that painful breakup, that if I love him enough I would let go of him and wish for his happiness. But I couldn't let go and couldn't understand what she meant until now. 

Thank you. I wish the best for you.

40,"Dear Prof Ben,

I've been together with this guy for about half a year. At first I thought he was perfect for me, our values and future goals aligned well, and we have similar things we liked to do as well, which made it easy to talk and hang out. But the more we are together, the more I feel that we are incompatible after all.

Though he does treat me well overall, I feel like he chose me for the sake of finding someone he could settle down with, instead of a partner he actually loves. I have asked him directly about this, which he neither confirmed nor denied, but gave a very roundabout answer which leads me to believe it is true. I know some people are okay with that and that's fine, but personally, a rs where you don't love your partner isn't quite for me. This made me super sad at first, but slowly that sadness is turning into annoyance somehow. We also tend to have a lot of misunderstanding when we talk about day to day stuff (I've never had such issue when communicating with any of my friends, or even any of the guys I used to date, but somehow we often have miscomms) , which is starting to get on my nerves sometimes.

What makes breaking up difficult is that we have met each others families (which I now regret introducing him so early) and that he doesn't treat me badly per se. Should I just hold on and try for this or is there no point?

However, my boyfriend don’t seems to have any urge to be involve in such acts with me. Especially when we had not have sex for 3months, he will still continue to use his phone when we went on staycation. So we will spent the night just me sleeping and him using his phone. And the funny thing is recently, he came to my hse so we were cuddling. And then he told me that he is unable to have sex  because he had masturbate last night twice. So imagine when we are doing, he’s only able to withstand one time but when masturbating he can actually do it two or three times. I don’t know what’s wrong here can anyone advise

45,"Sorry in advance: long post to which I'm tearing to...I dont even know why but it's just a rush of past feelings. 

I've been with my boyfriend for about 6 years now. We have been good but the beginning was pretty hard...I thought I got better but the insecurities are coming back. 
*
A little background: He is verrryy good looking - albeit singaporean, people would often ask if he is local (don't know why the heck singaporeans don't think singaporean guys can be good looking) and compliment his looks. 
I'm average I would say, but definitely not model look material. But also, I had no qualms over his above average looks or this attention. Partly because I thought I was very secure (based on my past relationships) and thought this would be the same. He also chased me for quite a long period as I was initially not keen in a rhsp. 

Although, sometimes it stung a little - when we went out, people would compliment his looks. When we go to family gatherings, people would again compliment his looks. I get the compliments but sometimes I feel it's just for the sake of. And guys are not the only ones who would chase attached girls...I've had other girls try to squeeze their way into our relationship to get his attention (attempt to initiate physical contact in a sexual manner, text daily etc).

But I always reminded myself that we both have our strengths, I'm the brain of the relationship and have had charted a successful pathway for myself (I've helped him build his intelligence appetite largely too). But no one really sees that. Cause yes..looks win. 

And in the beginning of our relationship, he did give in to the attention from girls (reply their messages, flirt back) because it was new to him (coming from a boys school) and so I turned from being a super secure girl to a pretty insecure one. We had huge fights...and since then, I've always had this tiny insecurity streak in me. I let it go through lots of talk with him (he has drawn boundaries and have been loyal) and self reflection but I always have this doubt that he has a upper hand, and can, and MAY cheat. 

Presently...

He started working (he has always worked in a male dominated env) and not surprisingly, the attention has begun and girls have began throwing themselves at him. He used to be pretty naive & assumed this actions (from obviously interested girls) were not to lead him on but I'm a girl and I know. He has been telling me what they've been trying to do and his responses have been kept to a friendly manner but I just cant seem to trust him. He knows he is good looking and I'm afraid the attention gets to his head again and he starts to flirt back. I do feel disgusted at myself for being so insecure....but I'm so tired. 

I sometimes wish I wasn't dating such a good looking person because it makes feel like shit about myself and I feel that I'm not strong enough to deal with the shit that comes with it. All the thoughts and what ifs...should I just end it? 

Has anyone had a similar experience? How do you deal with it? I'm really hoping to salvage this relationship before my insecurities build again...because I foresee this to be a long term issue.

47,"A few weeks ago I went out with a guy I met on a dating app. We chatted for a week before meeting for the first time. We had coffee at a cafe and watched a movie after that. Towards the end of the movie, he suddenly touched my boobs. I was stunned but remained calm. 

I questioned him after the movie and he said he couldn't resist it because my boobs are so big. WTF? I told him I'm not feeling well and went home straightaway. I felt so angry and stupid. Like why did I go out with this scumbag. 

I decided to avenge myself because well, I am young and foolish and immature. I created a fake account and tried to find his profile. Using my fake account, I approached him on the app and asked him on a date. He lives in Punggol so I purposely asked him to meet outside a shop in a shopping mall in Jurong while I sit down at a nearby cafe with my bestfriend, enjoying my cup of coffee and watching him like a stalker.

I told him I will be late and asked him to wait for me. So he foolishly waited for 30 minutes. He then texted me again and asked me where I was. So I lied to him that I'm having diarrhoea and stuck in the toilet at home. So he waited for another 30 minutes. It was so entertaining to watch him stand outside a shop and constantly check his phone for messages from a person who would never show up.

My friend and I decided that we had enough fun so I texted him that I have to bail on him because something came up. I then deleted my fake account right away. The look on his face when he saw the message. Priceless. 

Guys and girls, beware of people you meet on dating apps. Try to meet at crowded places and avoid dark or secluded places. Be safe or end up becoming a pyscho like me ;)

49,"Hi #74635, I understand how you feel. Some years ago, I also had two suitors. The first guy is husband material. The second guy is more like boyfriend material.

I saw that both had their own merits and struggled for a very long time to make a decision. Both were very serious in me and I had feelings for both.

Eventually I chose the husband material guy because he was like so perfect. We dated for awhile and everything was great. But whenever he brings up topics on marriage, I would feel uneasy. Then I realised that I don't love him. I only liked the idea of dating a perfect guy. So I broke up with him. 

After breaking up, the boyfriend material guy continued to woo me. I got moved by his efforts and decided to date him. He's a very smart and interesting guy but after some time, I found out that we were incompatible. So I broke up with him.

In the end, I gave up on both guys because I realised I've never loved any of them. If I had loved the husband material guy, I wouldn't have been so scared of marrying him. If I had loved the boyfriend material guy, I wouldn't have given up on him so easily. But most importantly, if I had loved anyone of them, I wouldn't have struggled to make a decision. 

Some time later, the same situation happened again, two suitors at the same time. Both were equally sincere and eligible. But somehow I was very sure who I want to be with and who I want to remain friends with. The moment one of them confessed, I quickly rejected. The other one that I didn't reject is now my fiance. 

I guess if you love someone, you won't even consider dating another person. And you can see yourself spending your life with this person and you can't imagine losing him. 

If you can't decide who to choose, you probably don't love anyone of them and shouldn't choose any of them. You should choose the person whom you should love most - yourself. Choose to love yourself first. Love yourself enough to work on yourself, be the best version of yourself. 

Love yourself enough to not want to settle for a guy who is not enough for you. Husband material, so what? No matter how perfect this person is, he will never be enough if you don't love him. If he can't make you forget about other guys then he's not the one for you.

50,"hello, I’ve never really felt the need to express my feelings on a platform like this but recently I’ve felt like it’s gotten worse and I can’t bear them anymore.

I’ve been always an optimistic kid and would try to help others as much as I can. However, during my secondary/poly school years, I got bullied by a group of girls and because they were considered popular, many guys who were friends with them had the same feelings towards me as well, this would eventually escalate and lead to my inability to even utter a word to the opposite sex or anyone who seemed remotely popular. I became a shell of who I used to be, and omitted myself from as many activities as possible. I hated the times where Teachers told us to choose our teams as I knew I would be a leftover. This shattered my self confidence and esteem, and I withdrew even further inwards. The breaking point came when I overheard a ghastly untrue rumor spread by one of my bullies few years after the apparent initial rumor started. At that point, I literally felt everything keeping me afloat disintegrate. How has it been so many years and why has such a ridiculous rumor even last till now.
By then, I refrained my actions and words to anyone, and kept to a minimum.

Since then, I’ve made it into university, I would never have thought I got this far. I still remain as quiet, and dislike speaking in public. I do not use social media to interact with classmates etc. 
Recently, I did a group project and I could not get along with my team members due to differences in goal-setting and standards of academic writing. Which was why when the time came for another project, I became another leftover. Although it may have been my fault for not being able to comply with my members work, I did pull more than my own weight in the project and did a huge percentage of the work.

I feel really disheartened and have been contemplating suicide for a long time now. I know it’s my fault that I’m this way, but I hope people understand that my circumstances have conditioned me to become this way. I came into Uni, hoping I could start afresh, but I feel like complete and utter sh*t, for lack of a better word. 

People have told me to change myself, but it’s easier said than done. I really don’t know what to do. I don’t know how I’m going to continue on.

I feel like confessing here because the guilt is eating me alive every night. I can’t believe I did THAT to bring down my cohort peers. Please do not judge me; I’m really here to share my stories. So where should I begin? 

Last semester, I had four finals. I remember I studied till very late and I snack a lot. Like literally a lot. I swear I ate a house full of chips, cookies and some sugary candies. I was so hungry while studying in UTown. I stay in a hall by the way. So what happened was that I had a bad stomachache. I couldn’t unload my faeces naturally. It feels like entering the JB custom - always jammed. The night before my first paper, I did not shit. I hold my shit throughout the examination as I was so stressed and worried for my paper. I silently farted and I think it affected the people around me so badly that they were complaining to the invigilators. I even saw the guy beside me almost vomited by giving an awful expression. It hurts me so bad that my farts are making people around me uncomfortable. I tried my best to hold them but I couldn’t. I kept letting waves of smelly farts during the whole duration of the examination. As a result, some of the people around me did not complete their paper and submitted half-answered paper. I glanced and I saw. I was so remorseful about this. I observed the same trend for the other three papers. I told my best friend after this. She told me it was not my intention and I shouldn’t feel bad about it. As a shy girl always, I don’t know what to do. 

Although my stomach is feeling way better now after the exams, I’m fearful that the same shit will happen again in this new coming semester. I’ve two finals this time round though.

58,"I've been dating this girl for about half a year. She's smart, kind, funny, pretty and mature. Overall, she's a down-to-earth and easygoing person. What I like most about her is she's very supportive and understanding. She doesn't expect much from me and she gives me the freedom to do whatever I want. 

The thing is she's pretty laid back, unmotivated and always jokes about her dreams of being a 'taitai'. She puts in minimal effort into her job and dislikes anything that requires effort e.g. working, doing housework, exercising, travelling, shopping, etc. 

But she puts in a lot of effort into our relationship. She would cook meals for me, make handmade gifts for me, listen to me rant about my work and save up to buy me all the things I like. 

I'm amazed by the crazy amount of effort she puts into making me happy. But sometimes I have doubts whether she's doing all these because she loves me or because I can give her the life she dreams of. 

I like to shower her with gifts and take her to a nice meal. I also discussed with her that I can afford for the both of us if she wants to be a stay home mom and that money won't be an issue at all. 

Last week, I introduced her to my family. We went to eat Haidilao and throughout the meal, she kept cooking the meat and veg for me and my family. My parents even had to remind her to eat more because she wasn't really eating. She kept smiling and laughing while trying to hold a conversation with my family. 

I was quite shocked that she was way more friendly and helpful than usual at the dinner. It seems like she was trying very hard to impress me and my family. Which pushes me to doubt her even more. 

How to know if a person truly loves you? I feel touched by the things she does for me but I also wonder if she would still love me if I am not as successful and unable to provide for her. Am I too cynical?

60,"What are your thoughts about a 100% inheritance tax regime, or in the alternative, that inheritance should be capped at a certain amount (e.g. $100,000)? 

1. Reducing Income Inequality
The first and most obvious consequence is the reduction of income inequality in the country. The rising income inequality has caused much unhappiness not just in Singapore but many countries around the world. In fact, one of the reasons for the civil unrest in Hong Kong was that there was a huge disparity in income between the classes of people where the few rich individuals hold much of the country’s wealth. With inheritance tax, the rich can no longer pass on their wealth to their offspring and this allows the country to redistribute the wealth in the country. While this may seem unfair to the ultra-rich, perhaps the welfare of the masses should take precedent over the interests of the ultra-rich who have already enjoyed their wealthy lives.  

2. Promoting meritocracy and encouraging hard work
The idea of meritocracy is that people are rewarded for their hard work, talent, efforts etc., rather than wealth or social class. The offspring of ultra-high net worth individuals would, upon the demise of their parents, inherit millions (if not billions) without accomplishing anything in life. This is unfair to those who slog all their lives but not accumulate even 1% of the inherited wealth and it is purely a game of luck – whether you are born in a rich or poor family. As everyone starts off from a fresh sheet of paper, people (including those from wealthy families) are motivated to work hard so that they can be rewarded in life. 

3. Allowing the state to fund for local universities
With the money collected from inheritance, the state can provide free university education to every Singaporean (like some European countries). This allows everyone to compete equally with the same level of education, further promoting meritocracy in the country. Currently, those who are less fortunate are unable to pursue further education due to the costs of education (a degree in local universities costs $25k to $50k).

4. Removal of other taxes like income tax and property tax 
The inheritance tax (which taxes the dead) can possibly replace the current income tax and property tax (which taxes the living). This is also the reason why inheritance tax has been dubbed the “fairest tax”. With the removal of living taxes, people can spend all the money that they have earned on the things they want. 

Potential arguments and counterarguments:
1. People can evade this by through gifts before they die – this can be resolved via gift tax.
2. People should be entitled to leave what they have saved to their offspring – this is a fair point but in exchange for giving up the inheritance the state provides free university education to every citizen to ensure that they can be self-sufficient. 
3. People can spend all their money before they die, leaving the state with no money – the state can still obtain its funds via GST (more revenue from GST as consumption increases). This also promotes the country’s economy through an increase in aggregate demand.
4. There is no point in putting money in CPF – the purpose of CPF is to ensure that citizens are self-sufficient after their retirement, rather than for the sake of passing the money down to their offspring. In any case, it may form part of the limit on the amount of inheritance as mentioned at the beginning. 


tldr: there are many benefits accruing from an inheritance tax regime, such as reduction in income inequality, promoting meritocracy, free university education, removal of living taxes etc. would you support inheritance tax?

I don't think the dude is wrong in thinking that they may be incompatible in the future. Sex is by and large a huge part of a relationship, and it is important when you want to go long term with your partner. Just because you prioritise sex does not mean you cannot control your urges - you just need to find someone who can communicate with you on the same level on this issue.

So here's my advice - if the issue (whether it be sex, religion, career or family) is high up on your list of things you consider important in a relationship, don't settle for less. Find someone who can see eye-to-eye with you on the important matters, because if you close one eye on them near the beginning of your relationship, these are the things that can cause a divide when the going gets tough. 

Communicate and make a decision. Don't settle just because you have committed time or money into a relationship. If it is that important to you, you will be able to find someone who can agree with you on it. 

TLDR: just because you love someone, does not mean that you let go of what is important to you.

64,"Hi, I need some advice on my relationship. I feel like breaking up with my girlfriend. My girlfriend and I have been together for a little over six months. Before we got attached, everything was sweet and lovely. However, once we got together, I felt that I am being controlled and watched. 

Anything that I am doing, Anywhere that I am going, Where am I currently, Who I am with, I have to report it to her. Things get worst when she does not approve of the activities that I am doing. She does not like me playing mahjong cause her father was an addict, and shes afraid of me being one. Note here, I have only played mahjong as a fun and chill game. Not gamble. We ended up fighting because of that. 

Going to the gym can be difficult as she thinks that I will look at all the females there when I am exercising. She does not like me hanging out with girls (even girls that are attached), for fear that I might betray her. Sometimes, I am only hanging out with guys, and she isn’t happy about it. I have never cheated on her, and I only have eyes for her. When we talk about this topic, she claims that she is sensitive and insecure, but can’t she just trust me? 

I’m always paying for her share and buying her gifts. Why? As a china national, she claims that the guy must give gifts to the female every now and then as it is a “china thing.” Heck, I even had to buy a phone for her. My poor wallet.

There are many other more situations but I hope to keep this post short. I really do love her, but her insecurities and sensitivity are making our relationship difficult. Having fights everyday, it is really tiring. Help.

66,"Hi there, I seem to have a fear of public texting.
Unlike most people I’ve met who are avoidant of face to face conversations and phone calls, I am afraid of sending text messages to people apart from my immediate circle of friends. For me, sending a text in a group chat is worse than public speaking. This phobia affects my behaviour and social interactions. 
For instance, after mustering enough courage to send a text to propose a meetup with some old friends, I’ll almost instantly start to worry if no one replied me. “What if no one wants to meet up?” “What if I am putting them in a difficult spot?” “Would it have been better if someone else arranged this instead of me?” “Do they dislike me?” …. And the overthinking thoughts begins their downward spiral, causing self-doubt and eventually a low self-esteem. Ultimately, the fear was too much that I chickened out at any opportunity I get, which made me seemed irresponsible.
The inability to distinguish genuine emotions from texts could be one of the reasons for my fear. In phone calls and real-life conversations, I can depend on tone, volume, body language and facial expressions to determine true meaning of their words, these are harder to fabricate unlike texts. 
I was also cyber-bullied harshly in secondary school which impacted me strongly.
Most people who know me in real life would not associate me with this problem. I’m upbeat, positive, sociable (talkative) and capable holding conversations, not someone that gives an impression of “social anxiety”. It’s also a reason why I have not sought help for this text anxiety, I can simply run away from it by not texting! However, it has become progressively difficult to do so as virtual communication replaces more real time interactions. 
I would like to know if anyone out there with similar experiences? 
Any advices that I can try out to overcome this problem?
& if I should seek professional help (& where)
This was a long post, thanks for reading!

67,"I recently got back in contact with an old acquaintance whom I used to be rather close with. 

Ever since we knew each other,i was aware that he is married and was constantly hitting on me. I hadn't try hard to avoid his advances as the relationship was beneficial to my career advancement. 

Since then, I went away and recently came back and he again tried to get back in touch. I am well aware what he has in mind but I came to know that his wife is currently pregnant. I start to feel disgusted at his doings, and really pity the wife. I have also since stopped contacting him. But I'm unsure if I should tell his wife about this sickening behaviour especially they have been trying for years to conceive. And now that they finally got somewhere, I thought the guy would wake up from his idea and spend more time with his partner. But apparently he hasn't. I'm sure he will just start to someone else, if not me. I'm really lost as I feel both guilty and pity his partner. Please give me some advice.

68,"Today, I felt my heart properly break for the first time. The course I’m studying has quite a heavy workload so I haven’t been going home for the past three weeks. My father came to visit me today. He is rarely ever free and today is one of those days that he could make time. 

My father is close to 70 years old and he is still not retired. He works as a cleaner at a country club during the day and holds another cleaning job at the community centre near my house at night. For some reason, he had half a day off today and he said he wanted to tour my hall. He came over and after showing him my room, we decided to get dinner at the Kopitiam at Kent Ridge MRT. 

I know my father doesn’t have money so I offered to pay for his dinner. Guess what? The silly man ordered the cheapest thing he could find - fishball noodles. There was a lady (very well dressed, looks to be at least middle-class) infront of us in the queue and she left her chilli on the counter then walked away somewhere. My father didn’t see it and thought that that was an extra sauce so he just took it and put in on our tray. When the lady returned, she said very sarcastically that someone took her chilli while glancing up and down at my father. He immediately apologised and explained to her that we were not aware and that she could have her chilli back but she replied “你动过的我才不要。安葬死”, which loosely translates into “I don’t want what you’ve touched. You’re dirty to death”. 

This was when I realised that my father was still in his uniform. I almost screamed at this lady seeing as she was clearly younger than my father and was being rude. However, my father held me back and simply apologised again. He said that he’s used to it and it suddenly hit me that this is what he does all on a day to day basis. He apologises and lets people walk over him. He is invisible. I always knew my dad worked hard and is always at the mercy of others but seeing it with my own two eyes was an entirely different experience. I couldn’t even hold back my emotions and start tearing uncontrollably while we were eating. I had to lie that I was tearing because I got chilli in my eye but the truth is I was heartbroken by how my dad has to swallow his pride all the time. 

I can’t wait for the day when I can tell him to stop working and stop apologising for everything. All my dad ever did was love and dote on me but everyone else has just been so awful to him. Dear rich people, what did we ever do wrong to you?

At first I thought he was perfect for me, our values and future goals aligned well, and we have similar things we liked to do as well, which made it easy to talk and hang out. But the more we are together, the more I feel that we are incompatible after all. 

Though he does treat me well overall, I feel like he chose me for the sake of finding someone he could settle down with, instead of a partner he actually loves. I have asked him directly about this, which he neither confirmed nor denied, but gave a very roundabout answer which leads me to believe it is true. I know some people are okay with that and that's fine, but personally, a rs where you don't love your partner isn't quite for me. This made me super sad at first, but slowly that sadness is turning into annoyance somehow. We also tend to have a lot of misunderstanding when we talk about day to day stuff (I've never had such issue when communicating with any of my friends, or even any of the guys I used to date, but somehow we often have miscomms) , which is starting to get on my nerves sometimes. 

What makes breaking up difficult is that we have met each others families (which I now regret introducing him so early) and that he doesn't treat me badly per se. Should I just hold on and try for this or is there no point?

84,"TLDR: I broke up with my bf because he's a loner 

We've been together for a year and I know him for 2 years. In the two years, he has gone out for dinner 3x with a JC friend, once with a pri sch friend, once with a cousin. That's it. I open his WA and I'm the only one who texts him regularly apart from his parents and siblings.

As a 25 year old guy, I expect you to have some people around you. Relatives, cousins, friends, someone! I'm an introvert too but I find him extreme. He works out by himself everyday, watches football, plays FIFA. I've asked him to at least watch football at a coffeeshop so you are around people, find some football fans online so you can talk to people. He can go weeks without anyone other than me and his fam talking to him. I couldn't stand it. I broke up.

How did he manage to get a gf then? He had so much time on his hands that he was always there for me, every impromptu lunch, every text at whatever time, he replied, he showed up.

Now, I'm moving on with my life but I'm worried for him. He refuses to change himself, he says he likes stability and is working on himself. But you won't grow just by being alone. You grow by talking, sharing, giving and being surrounded by people.

I asked him, ""Have you felt happy in the recent few years?""
He replied, ""No. I feel peaceful and that's enough for me.""

Loneliness is very difficult. I'm worried for him maybe because of guilt but idk what to do for him.

86,"Hi OP of #73996, I hope you reconsider breaking up with that loner ex-boyfriend of yours. I was just like you and I felt really bad for being like that.

My first boyfriend was also like a loner. He rarely went out with friends. He would only text me and his family and school mates only when necessary. He would spend most of his time studying, gaming and going out with me. I thought he was so weird and broke up with him. 

After that I happened to meet someone who's very different. Someone who would always hang out with friends, family, relatives. He was always texting people, attending events and gatherings and helping people with their chores. I was just a tiny part of his life and so I broke up with him. 

Eventually I met someone who is also like a loner. He does almost everything alone. Studying, shopping, eating, etc. He doesn't have many friends, just one or two that he sees a few times a year. He doesn't have many hobbies. He only likes reading books and watching tv.

I thought he was weird too. He doesn't go out with friends, he doesn't use any form of social media. He actually likes being alone. He thinks going out with people can be tiring so he politely rejects people from time to time. 

But he likes being with me alot. As we started working, we would travel to work together every morning, have breakfast every weekend, watch netflix on saturday nights. Ever since we started working, time has become so scarce. He has to work late every day. Work is highly stressful for him so he cherishes our weekend together. 

Eventually I became just like him. Working late nights and feeling too tired to do anything at all. Sometimes I dread outings and gatherings. My house became my favourite place to hang out. I don't feel like going out, don't feel like seeing anyone. I just need someone who makes me feel like I can totally be myself, someone who has seen me at my worst and still loves me no less. And that someone is that loner boyfriend of mine. 

He doesn't really want to hang out with people but he wants to hang out with me. I guess there's no better way of saying how special you are to someone. I don't care if he's weird or I've become weird because of him. If weird means being all comfortable and relaxed then I would gladly choose to be weird.

At 2pm he suggested catching a movie, but when we checked out GV, there was nothing we fancied. Then he suggested that we Netflix at his place (a few bus stops away from the mall we were at).
We watched 2 movies from 3-7pm, then abit nua so we ordered Grabfood. After dinner, we caught another show from 8-10pm. Throughout the 3 movies, we were together under the blanket on his single bed. It was cozy and it did not feel awkward, felt super comfy to be very honest. At 10++ we had enough of movies and proceeded to lie down and cuddle. 
Things got heated and we went to 3rd base really quickly after making out. However after around 1hr(?) for some reason he was clearly very hesitant and said something like this ""I have been hard for very long and I really want to do it with you. But I think it is better to wait till we are together, not now when things are still ambiguous. Idw to take advantage of you."" 
Woah I was quite taken aback. Though it was indeed anti-climax, and a little traditional, but I guess it shows that he is someone with self-control and serious about this? Not sure... any thoughts guys?

The store appeared to be very busy, as it was after work hours for most people. Once I was done shopping, I got to the tills and jumped between several tills to try and beat the crowds. At the last till I waited, it seemed to take forever, so I became a bit inpatient and at the same time annoyed, that it was taking such a long time. I honestly couldn’t understand why it was taking so long when the other queues appeared to be moving faster. As I got closer to the till, I saw an auntie behind that was scanning the products and bagging them for the customer in front.  She appeared to be older than 60 years old and although it seemed like she was doing everything very slowly, I could tell that she was trying to rush and do it as fast as she could. I instantly felt extremely bad for getting a bit annoyed and wondering why the check-out couldn’t be faster. After  having a good look at her, I looked around and realised that most of the staff members appear to be elders but that doesn’t stop them from doing a fantastic job. My heart clenched at the realisation that people of this age have to still continue working. It made me really, really upset, but at the same time angry, as I see posts on here about people asking whether they should give some money to their parents. 

My mum also works at an unqualified job and this really hit close to home, as I could picture her in this situation since she is alone and has no savings. The point I’m making: please take care of your parents and for god’s sake, give these people a well deserved break by providing a state pension like any western country. If this country has the money to pay every boy to go to the army for a year and a half, why doesn’t it have money to provide state pension?

97,"Does anyone else think it’s becoming more and more challenging to live and communicate with parents as one grows older?
I’ve been quarrelling a lot with my mother lately and it feels so emotionally draining. Probably a part of it is my problem as I’ve been facing a lot of stress at work lately and it’s affecting my mood when i’m at home with my family. But I guess she can be very unreasonable at times too. Let me give some examples to illustrate.
She’s a clean freak bordering on OCD. Every day when I come home from work, instead of asking about how my day went, she’ll nag about how my cleaning is not up to standard, things in my room are not where they’re supposed to be, some of my clothes not ironed immediately after washing, the floor is perpetually dusty...and many more of such trivial stuff. Well, I certainly would do a better job if I’m a full time housekeeper, but I’m not! It’s hard for me just to have peace and quiet after a long day at work.
She’s been a very authoritative parent since I was young and it doesn’t change now that I’m a working adult. She’ll dictate what time I should go to bed and wake up, take my meals and shower. And openly voice her displeasure if I don’t obey or try to reason with her. Sometimes she even makes comments about my outfit and won’t stop until I change to something she prefers. Aren’t all these too much now that I’m all grown up?
At home I totally have no privacy. She’ll open my cupboard and drawers as and when she pleases, and sometimes discards things that she deem not useful without asking for my permission. She’ll judge me on the stuff I have / bought (e.g “I found .... in your drawer, you bought yourself ah? Or someone gave you? Gosh, it’s so ugly.”). Don’t understand why she must do such things, sigh. 
The worst thing is that she nags at me endlessly for being single and not proactively looking for a bf. She’ll keep hinting at how many of her friends have become grandmas, and sometimes when she’s unwell or in bad mood she’ll loudly exclaim, “Aiya wanna die also cannot die in peace, my daughter still not married,” making me feel bad like I’m such a burden in her life :( Well, the reason I’m single now is that I used to get cheated on by my long term bf 2 yrs ago and I’m still living with the trauma until now, so I feel very deeply hurt when she says such things...
I do not despise my mother in any way, deep down I still love and respect her. Just that at times I got really frustrated and in desperate need for some space, autonomy and privacy now that I’m a working adult. And I wish she won’t keep forcing me to find a bf when I’m not ready.
Any suggestions on how to deal with such a parent will be much appreciated. Unfortunately moving out is not an option as I’m not earning much and don’t think I can afford the rent.

Looking back, i haven’t splurge on myself just yet these 1.5 years... i save up alot honestly. I have 5 polo t-shirt, one for each day of work hahaha i have been using my iphone for 3 years now, my G-shock watch have been with me for 5 years now. Typical engineering guy lol. But yeah i just freaking love buying for others. Balmain bedsheets on offer and got them for my mom because the queen needs that 1000 thread count Egyptian cotton for her beauty sleep lolol, i see Bobbi Brown on offer and i get them for my sister ...  like i love it. And my mom’s birthday is coming so i got her a 11 Dyson.. I went to Europe recently and i got my colleagues swiss made chocolate gifts and i just love it buying for others. Maybe because i used to not have much growing up. My dad was unemployed and was taking drugs.. my mom divorced and was a single working parent earning 1.8K a month and she has to takecare of us 3 siblings . We didn’t go out much too, and i used to only use those $0, 2 years contract phones haha. Gifts were always limited to my birthday. I always envied those with the Sony Walkman phone haha. But yeah man, i’m totally enjoying the fact that i am working now and i learnt alot from the hardship. Anyway like they say, you only gain from giving. Do not be afraid of poverty when giving! Enjoy the festive season guys and spread the joy of giving(:

101,"Our story dates back to 2013, when 我的歌声里 was the #1 hit ,I was always there for you during your ups and downs; it was one-sided for nearly 5 years. When I thought you would eventually get married to him, I moved on. 

Just when I was about to start my love life, you contacted me. You were depressed and you needed me. I chose you without much hesitation, I just couldn't bear to leave you in that state. 
Perhaps, it was the cultural differences or my lack-of experience, I struggled to adapt. But I loved you more than anything else, including myself, I followed my instinct and did whatever I could to make you happy.

I knew it was a toxic relationship , but I ignored all the red flags and dove right into it. I forgave all your wrongdoings, I would make sure to sleep later than you, I would buy anything for you. I spent all my savings to maintain the relationship just because I couldn't bear to see you sad or upset. You were my everything. 

You never cared about my feelings, my happiness or my well-being.  The relationship was simply two person in love with one person. We had plans for marriage, but I knew I couldn't tolerate this for the rest of my life. I wanted you to change, but you just couldn't change. I wanted out.

After the break up, you used various ways to make me stay. I stayed, but you couldn't stand the changes. We broke up again. I knew a leopard would never change its spot. After the 3rd break-up I blocked you on every social media platform, it was only way for you to move on. 

Fast forward to today, it was a bittersweet moment seeing your post with your new boyfriend. I am glad that you are happy again, but I know I will never be the same.

104,"I've been having a moral dilemma.
My girlfriend doesnt like me hanging out with a friend of mine mainly cause she sees him as shady (capable of cheating on his girlfriend and stuff like that) and has been overbearing whenever I hang out with him with constant calls just to check that I'm not doing anything shady as well. Shes firm about me not hanging out with him but I do fight for my rights cause hes one of my guys.
As such I've lied to her on a couple of occasions when I went out drinking with him and other friends but told her I was at home sleeping. 
However I have previously explained that whatever his morals may be regarding cheating or anything in that regard, doesnt compromise my own. He can ask me out to places with other girls and I've never made the decision to cheat on her both emotionally and physically.
As a result of this, she now constantly demands my live location and video calls me to check up on me that I am where I said I would be. This happens even when I'm with other (non shady) friends in her opinion. 
My problem is that I know she genuinely cares for me, but her paranoia is driving me pretty nuts, and I feel like I cant keep up if she keeps doing nonsense like check up on me, demanding to look at my messages and perform random interrogations when I'm with her. I want to give her that sense of trust but I cant give in to her demand of me letting go of a friend just cause she thinks he has shaky morals. 

Need some genuine advice on dealing with this TIA

Today I witnessed it first hand. NUS chinese male business student here doing internship at a tech company. My Senior manager needed my help today, he said he wanted to send some food. Anyway it’s friday and most of our colleagues are on leave anyway since it’s the festive season

So we ended up at a restaurant where we took packet food for like 300 pax and here i thought it was for a company lunch or something. We ended up at a mosque where he dropped 100 and then he went to another mosque for another 100 before ending up at an orphanage for the remaining food. He says anyone at the mosque can have it for their lunch. And then my Senior manager had lunch with me and got me a grab back to office before him going for Friday prayers himself! So he got back and we had a little chat, and he actually shared that he’s where he never imagined he would be at. He said he never imagined he would have a 5 digit salary and he says that, even before when he Just started working with a 3K starting salary, he tries to give part of his money for the poor or for a good cause because he had nothing to begin with. Hardship in the past kinda story.

 In Uni he used to give free tuition and volunteered every summer break to paint poor people’s house at poor estate. And he said that nobody becomes poorer from giving. Wow I’m seriously amazed, and i’m pretty sure there are many people like these out there! Seriously it made me think bout all the time i want another NMDs or Ultraboost when i already have enough and there are people out there who’s this nice. I’m starting to look at things really differently now.

In contrast i had a senior who just got a $4.4K monthly job told our group of friends that she called the HR to cancel her CDC $5 monthly contribution. Mehhh

106,"As someone who graduated from university some years back, I can't stress enough the importance of having a good mentor. I wasn't from NUS, but my mentor was. You see, my mentor was the longtime CEO of the company I work in and he was a Jack Welch-type figure here. Suffice to say, many of our company's businesses were built up by him.

I was not his original protege. It was another person. Let's name him X. X was originally the COO to my mentor and was slated to take over when my mentor retires. However, X was caught dabbling in some backdoor transaction. My mentor then ousted X and made me his heir-apparent. After some time, my mentor retired and I took over as CEO. My time finally came, or so I thought.

Not long after I took over as CEO, X managed to return to the board of directors by convincing some shareholders to support him. However, I once again found X dabbling in yet another backdoor transaction, so I ousted him from the company again. I also tried to form some joint ventures with our smaller but more nimble competitor for synergies and got a foreign conglomerate to invest in our company. This must have incensed my mentor for he hated our smaller competitor. I am unsure how it happened but some company money somehow landed in my personal bank account. You don't look at the gift horse in the mouth, so I decided to spend the money to pamper my wife instead of on myself.

On the pretext that I somehow lined my pockets with company money, my mentor is now conspiring with X to oust me at the next shareholders' meeting. My wife is also not helping as she keeps wanting to advise me and repeatedly emphasises that I am the CEO with the power to snuff out this conspiracy asap. It's vexing and I now regret having treated my mentor with gratitude. To all you young ones, please open your eyes wide and clear when following someone as a mentor.

I don't suppose you students have an answer to corporate shenanigans, so I just need your help for a simpler question: my friend wants to buy either a yacht or a submarine as his latest toy. Which should he buy?

108,"Dear guy
We decided to end this relationship. No, i think u decided to end it before i did. It doesn't matter anymore. You gave up too early, way too early. That made me sad. I was ready to keep trying as long as you are sure about me. But i could feel that you wasn't. All those harsh words u said to me. I thought u were only joking and that u didn't meant it. Only now did i realise that you had wanted to end it long ago, but u continued because u feared that i would be sad, because you saw how happy i was. I had seen u being happy with me. Was that a lie?

Have you seen the effort i put in, to try make you happy? I buy small stuff for you to show my support as you get through the tough and long hours of work. If i could, i would have cook or made something for you. I try not to complain or show negativity because I know how draining it gets when one is tired. When you are sick, all i wanted is to see you to ensure you are really okay. How many times have i boarded the train to your station, only to turn back because I knew you wouldn't have wanted me to do so. I brought you to meet my friends because i want you to feel assured that i wanted a future with you. How i wished we had more chance to have double dates. I took time out to meet you even though i was so tired and not feeling well. How many times did i crash in my bed the moment i settled down at home and yet i sounded so energetic in my texts? How many times do you know i was unwell and stressing to get myself well again so that we could meet as agreed? How many times did i thank you because i was afraid you would think that I'm taking you for granted. 

But how many times did you appreciate what i did for you? How many times did you encourage me when i felt like giving up.

All these because I want you to feel loved. But I didn't know what i need to do to make you happy. So i tried every possible ways i could think of. 
How many times did i reach out to you to communicate with me. All you did was to crack some jokes or change the topic to ignore my question. How much i wish to know more of your world and what you have been through - the good the bad and the things you did - the good and the bad. 

We both lost in this relationship. We lost to communication. 

And then it came to me that the best way to make you happy is to end this, no matter how much i didn't want to. I need to set you free. 

Maybe you were also disappointed in me in some way. But that i will never know. I'm sorry. I love you.

113,"I feel so guilty now I could just die. I don't know if I should just end things with my gf because I have made a huge mistake. 

Last month I held a christmas party at my place and invited some friends over. We had dinner, did gift exchange and played some drinking games. Three friends (one guy and two girls) decided to crash at my place since my parents were overseas. 

While the rest had gone home, the four of us continued with the games. We got so drunk that we fell asleep on the floor and couch. I woke up in the middle of the night to pee and then went back to my room. 

I saw that one of the girls was sitting on my bed, drunk texting on her phone, looking troubled. I asked her why she looks so sad. She then told me about her problems at home and that she was going through a difficult time in her life. 

I tried to listen to her and give her some advice. She asked me if she could hug me. So I let her hug me and told her that I will sleep in the living room. But she begged me to not leave her alone. So I sat on the edge of the bed. 

She then asked me if I could lie down beside her for awhile. So I did. She suddenly got up and sat on me. She started kissing me and then taking off my shorts and underwear. She then forced herself on me. I didn't resist although I didn't enjoy it. 

I guess I wanted it because I was deprived for a long time. 3 years to be exact. I met my gf a year after I broke up with my ex and we have been together for 2 years. 

We have stable careers and our rs has been great. But she would always turn me down whenever I suggest something intimate. She says she doesn't want any 'accident' to happen as she has no intention of getting married in the next 3 to 5 years. 

I respect her wishes so I would just back off whenever she turns me down. But I've always craved for more than just hugs and kisses. I know I have made a terrible mistake and I feel so miserable now. I have apologised to that friend of mine and have been trying to avoid her ever since that day. 

I have been thinking if I should be honest with my gf but I can't imagine losing her. Guys out there who have done things you're not so proud of, how do you cope with the guilt?

114,"I'm just wondering if what I'm doing now is wrong. I graduated a few years ago and I failed my probation for most of the jobs I held. I was always punctual, never committed any mistake, never taken leave or MC. I took pride in my work. I even enjoyed doing what I do. However, I always fail my probation, mostly because I'm not suitable for the job or I'm not good enough. I'm so upset I don't even feel like finding a job anymore. I just keep a lookout every now and then. Now I just spend my time on hobbies, housework and classes to pick up some skills.

I count myself lucky because my parents don't expect much from me. They turned down my offer to give them allowance but I still do it every month. They don't know I have been jobless for some time now. My parents divorced when I was younger and then my mom remarried so we seldom meet. My dad's job requires a lot of travelling so I don't get to see him much.

The only person who knows I'm jobless is my fiance. We're getting married next year. He has always been there for me for the past seven years. Although he's a super smart guy who earns five digit a month, he's very humble and down to earth. Our dates were mostly watching movies and eating at food courts.

He came from a broken family that struggled with poverty so he's very thankful for my support over the years, like buying him meals, clothes and necessities when we were students. Now that I'm jobless, he would always tell me not to worry about anything and assure me that he will take care of me.

The problem now is he would always insist on paying for all my expenses. He would also insist on giving me 20% of his pay every month. I always tell him I have a lot of savings and don't need his money but he would still transfer me his money. He also gave me a supplementary card and asked me to use it freely.

I feel super touched by the things he's done for me and I'm really thankful for having him in my life but I'm just wondering if it's wrong to take his money and whether it's okay to take a long break from work. More importantly, will my parents be okay with what I'm doing? Should I tell them the truth?

122,"Sex before or after marriage, why does it even matter? 

If one takes a scroll through the comment sections of posts with the word “virgin” or “virginity” inside, the common consensus of those commenting are “its the 21st century why are you being so narrow minded”, or “go to IMH and seek help la”. The idea of pre-marital sex is oftentimes ridiculed on this platform, albeit sometimes there are neutral parties who rightfully so, asks the OP to “respect the partner’s wishes”.

Here is what i think about this issue, and if you frankly don’t care, feel free to scroll past this post. Firstly, I fully agree that virginity is a social construct, and deeming females as impure just because they engage in pre-marital sex is a ridiculous notion. However, I strongly believe that if someone wishes to date a virgin, or subscribe to the idea of post marital sex, their concerns and requirements should be seen as valid and acceptable, and not subject to ridicule as seen in the recent posts. 

As mentioned earlier, virginity is a social construct where our perspective on it is shaped by our education, experiences, peers, school, family and most importantly, oneself. So why are we trying to put people down with differing opinions and legitimate concerns? Why are we not more accepting of the differing ideas and moral values of other people? While i strongly disagree that pre-marital sex makes one impure or immoral, I find it shocking that people are labelling OP’s with differing opinions as “lonely and virgin forever”, or “crazy go to IMH la”.

And to those OP’s who are trying to convince their partners to change their mindset, please do so in a respectful manner. Like I have mentioned earlier, one’s perspective on virginity is based on a multitude of factors, and just because you are horny does not mean that she’s crazy or too strict. Please support your partner fully through this transition if that is really what you want, or respect each other’s wishes and wait.

Fortunately, the senior staff didn't blame me for it. It could be possible that that senior staff was a nice guy(definitely one of the reasons) or my senior staff felt that it wasn't my fault.

I broke up a few months ago with my girlfriend of 6 months. It was me who broke it off knowing she wasn't the right person for me in the long run (it started getting too serious too soon). Her bestfriend somehow got into middle of this and confessed his love for her. I tried to give her space to figure things out but eventually decided that it wasn't worth it and broke up with her.
It was an ugly breakup even though I tried to keep it very straightforward. 
We blocked each other almost everywhere. However, now I know for a fact that both of them are together and it boils my blood. 
They jumped into the relationship just right after we broke up even though she used to tell me she never looked at him that way and never imagined being together with him. 
I would have been fine with it if it was someone else but knowing that she is with the guy who was somewhat a reason for our breakup makes me really mad. I keep getting these wild thoughts to ruin their relationship in some way or the other. 
I feel guilty for feeling that way. I thought I had moved on but the fact that it still bothers me knowing they are together, sleeping together says otherwise.
Obviously it must have been very easy for her to move on jumping from one relationship to other but it has been somewhat hard for me. 
I'm well surrounded with loving friends and family. Also I keep myself busy for most days with work. But the nights are the hardest. 

I keep switching to another IG account I created where I am following her to check her and that guy's post or stories. I know I should delete that account and try to move on but I just can't get myself to do it. 

Can someone share some advice. I really want to move on and leave both of them in the past.

So I met this person T during one of the exchange briefings and we agreed to rent a house in Melbourne together. He wanted this expensive apartment with 1 big (1 double bed) and 1 small bedroom (1 single bed). I was a bit reluctant but agreed anyway. At first we agreed to split the money equally without deciding who stays in which room. However at the back of my head I was thinking about the difference in bedroom sizes as there’s a huge difference. 

So I decided to discuss with him about who stays in which room. He wanted the big bedroom but I told him we are paying the same amount and the one staying in the bigger room should pay more. He said that I’m calculative and taking advantage of him. Then I asked if he would be ok if I got the bigger room instead and paying the same amount. He begun to scold me about how he didn’t want to stay with me, I should be grateful to him, how we already agreed to pay the same amount etc (but not who stays in which room). 

In the end we settled for 52:48 with both of us being unhappy. So I have a feeling I will have a bad time during exchange staying with this psycho...

134,"To confession #75084, 

I was bullied in Primary school. But I could not rmb what happened. I had suppressed part of my memory. Till now, I often have weird dreams about what actually happened.

I was bullied in secondary school. I was cyberbullied by my cca friend. And because of this, I became a weird person. I hate people approaching me. I hated myself and I tortured myself. I felt that no one really understand how I feel. I got really scared to make friends with people. Some of classmates made friend with me, but after telling them a small little secret which isn’t even true, they just spread hurtful words around in school. And because of that, I was famous in school and everyone hated me. I felt that I became a loner myself. I got very affected in my studies that I could not concentrate easily. 

When I went to ite, my senior that was in the same secondary school as me, spread gossips about me in class. Ended up everyone hated me and I became a loner myself. In my second yr, my sec sch senior even said a gossip about me right in front of me. I hated her. I wanted to give her a tight slap. And I have one sentence for her: YOU HATE ME, I HATE YOU TOO!! 

Now in poly, no one in the class seems to be willing to make friends with me. I am always quiet in class. And it seems very difficult for me to step out of my comfort zone. Cos the moment I step out, everyone starts judging me. Nevertheless, I am not gonna step out of my zone. Wish me all the best. A lot of people told me I need to step out of my comfort zone some day. But, I refused to. I only want to say: what’s the point of stepping out of my zone when everyone like to judge me about what I do? CANT YOU JUST LOOK AT YOURSELF AND JUDGE YOURSELF BEFORE YOU EVEN GIVE THE HECK TO JUDGE OTHERS? I KNOW IM A LONER, BUT WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU CAN JUDGE ME AND GOSSIP ABOUT ME AS AND WHEN YOU WANT? I HELPED YOU AND YOU GOSSIPED ABOUT ME. IS THAT HOW YOU THANK ME FOR HELPING YOU? IF THATS THE CASE, I MIGHT AS WELL DONT HELP YOU!

As months past, we got closer and began hanging out on our own. Somehow you started coming to my house and spending time with me despite your ridiculously tight schedule. I thought you were just fooling around and so I didn't put my all into it. I was always half hearted for I feared of getting myself burnt infront of a ""too good to be true"" perfect mate. 

I guess you grew tired of waiting and hinting, that over the years we each met our current partners. I told you I missed you then but I guess it was too late. It's been 4/3 years since each of us got married respectively but not a single day has passed for me without thinking of you. 

I love my current partner and am responsible for our marriage and will not do anything to jeopardize it, but my heart still yearns for you every day, every minute, uncontrollably. I hope you have found your 100% happiness with your partner and will never look back.

All this while, while reading confessions I noticed that her comments were not only harsh but more often than not, unnecessary. You come from a place of condescension... and it’s very clear. Maybe you genuinely want to help because of this bank of life experience you have, and you probably know you’re above average looking and therefore would get more support likes-wise and so yes it emboldens you to comment freely. HOWEVER, take caution and be kind, you’re still young, and you may not have as much going as you think.

148,"Dear you,

I thought we were progressing pretty well, chatting and meeting up so often, always sharing about our days and complaining about our problems. I'm sure you already know I like you, I've been explicit. But your responses are so mixed it's giving me hope only to constantly pull them away again. I know you try to be friendly to everyone, but many of your actions to me are different and could mean so much more. Of course I have wool over my eyes. 

Then I realised you had the ""habit"" of sometimes replying halfway, and sometimes not even checking our chat even though you're always online. I was blindly infatuated and just ignored it once, twice, many times. But communication is my love language, I felt that I was putting in all the effort maintaining the conversations.

I'm sure you didn't notice, but I've started to pull back, to reread our conversations and realise that most of the time it's just me initiating, you only doing so rarely. Days without replying even though you read the msg, then replying like it's nothing. Or replying on another app. 


I kept painting a picture to my friends that hey maybe you are the one. But now I have to take care of myself first. I really love you, but chat after chat you're just not putting in as much effort in conversations as I hope you would. 

Maybe it's time I move on. You don't owe me anything anyway, since we didn't go official. Have I already fell to the friendzone without even knowing? I hate that you feel bad for ignoring people, even those you friendzoned, yet you ignore me then replying like nothing happened.

I hate that I still want to give you more chances, because I keep lying to myself even though I already know the answer.

I went to the Dean's office the next day to speak to the vice dean and she said they considered all such cases if they can pull up any module grade before releasing the final grade. She told me if I needed the second upper for future masters, they are happy to write a letter of recommendation. I left disappointed. Subsequently I managed to get into banking and it was a tough time as it was aftermath of Lehman.

The only impact the second lower had on my first job was $200 lower on my starting salary. I managed to jump to other bigger banks and got promoted a few times. I am in a higher position than my peers who scored better than me in school. Banking is cut throat industry where one has to work smart and grades doesn't matter anymore. it's performance but I have to say SMU graduates are more vocal and NUS grad are more competent technically which is our disadvantage as in the corporate world, if you can speak better, management will take notice of you more. 

it's more important to have fun in your uni days and go for an exchange if you can. memories cannot be bought. No hurry to come out to work as you have the whole lifetime to work.

154,"Dear The Man

You saw my weakness and took my silence to your advantage. You viciously forced yourself on me. I remember those big hands of yours, groping my private parts and slipping your dirty hands into my panties. 

I cried hard and helplessly the first time. I hid myself. I called up someone. I couldn't talk. I could only sob. I hung up on them. 

It happened again. I tried avoiding you. You wouldn't stop. I wasn't brave enough to do or say anything immediately. I felt shame and fear. I had so much on my mind, so much reservations, concerns. I tolerated. I gave you the benefit of doubt. I talked with you, time and again. I tried rationalizing with you. I became numbed, then triggered. Now, I questioned my lack of rationality back then. 

Dear The Ones I Spoke Up To

One day, it broke. I broke. I said it out to someone else. I told you. That day, I regret the most. If only, I continued tolerating. If only if only. The hurt wouldn't be this deep, so deep now. 

I spoke up. I wasn't suicidal then, I was desperate for the wrongs to end. But now, I think, I may be so. Because of the aftermath, the re-traumatization, and the additional pain I could had avoided if I did not speak up. The look of disdain on the faces of those I so trusted to speak out to. The horror you put me through. Now, I wake up each day, dreadful, and pained. I go to sleep, wishing my eyes never open again. The nightmares are a constant struggle I fight against every night.

I felt my body was tainted. But now, I feel my body, my heart, my mind, my soul, my everything is way beyond just tainted. I feel inferior and small. I was exposed, I was put through re-humiliation by the ones I so trusted, I was lied to, I was betrayed, misunderstood, and abandoned. I tried forgetting. I couldn't. I tried to trust again. But I am so terrified. Could I ever trust again? Could I survive through this? 

I have been honest, and I will continue to be so. I wanted to live. I wanted to be a blessing. I wanted to survive through and to forge a future I envisioned for myself. But now, I want to give up. Purity is important to me. My body is no longer pure, my life is no longer pure. I no longer know what I am fighting for. My life? What about my life is worth living for now? 

My dear family

Sorry. I am sorry you did not know about all these that have been happening to me. Sorry that I did not share. I felt shame, I felt fear. I did not want to pain you with these, and all the more I do not want to do so now. Please understand me, why I am doing this. I want you to be happy. I know all parents want their children to be happy, too. I want you to know that, I am happy to be your daughter. Sorry that I did not show it enough. I have been drained. And sometimes, it's just hard to keep up with happiness. 

You saw through 20 over years of my life. You saw how hard I've fought for what I wanted. I was so bad in my studies I was mocked at when I was young. And so, I worked hard in my studies, for my grades, for the scholarships. I juggled my studies and work and tutoring. Once, I juggled multiple jobs in a single period. Tough, but you saw it, I never complained. And I genuinely was happy. I looked forward to meals with you. I wanted to see you smile, hear you laugh. I wanted you to be happy. I wanted a successful life, I wanted to be the daughter you could be proud of. I was proud of my achievements, and at the same time, cherished the simplicity of our lives. 

There were times I was down, times when I felt defeated and drained. But these were the moments when I bounced back up, higher. I had moments of sadness and failures, but I never let them keep me down for long. I knew what I wanted. I had my ambitions, my aspirations, my dreams and goals. I knew your expectations of me, and I knew the expectations I had for myself. 

However, this one setback has kept me down for way too long. You questioned, too. I've been doing a lot of things out of the norm recently, doing things for myself, things I normally don't. All just because I was fighting hard to keep my will to live. Fighting hard to see beyond the current suffering and pain, to see again the gift of life. But they aren't helping. And I know I can't sustain anymore. I know I can't spend anymore money on myself just to try to keep myself alive; our finances are tight. 

Now, I just want to be selfish. What will happen to you if I were to do what I want to do now? Probably heartbroken, and more traumatized than I ever am now. Will you understand me? Could I ever forgive myself? That plunge sometimes is so tempting. I just want to say that, please know that I love you, I really do. Sorry that I've never said it. 

My dear friends

If this gets posted, if you read this, and you are my friend, and if you suspect this to be me, please reach out to me. I yearned to have someone with me during this period of my life. I don't even know who I am addressing this to, because I have been so busy studying and working hard my life. I don't spend much time with anyone, other than my family. Do I really have friends, friends who will know this is me, and will be willing to reach out to me? I just know I don't want to be alone. It has been a way too lonely and frightening journey. 

Since that day, I only wish someone would hold my hands and walk me through the darkest days of my life, till I see light. But I am still struggling my way alone in this valley of darkness. Lost, drained, and hopeless. 

Dear Self

Sorry that I failed you this time.

156,"Amidst all the troll, relationship and faith-in-human lost confessions here, I'd like to share something positive, and hopefully encouraging. I just graduated from NUS this year, but it's only now that I feel ready to share my story. 

I grew up in a single-parent family with my mom and little sister. Throughout primary school, I was doing decently well in school and my CCAs. We weren't rich, but we survived just fine as a family. 

Everything changed during secondary school when my mom was first diagnosed with cancer. When I first heard the news, all I could think of was 'why me?'. It felt like god was being unfair towards me. I was not a saint, but I did my best to live my life honestly and did everything as right as I could. Yet, this had to happen to me. From then on, my life started to go downhill. I started skipping school, my grades suffered, mixed around with the wrong company, and committed petty crimes. 

My mom had no idea all these were happening because half the time, she was in the hospital and my teachers avoid bothering her with these news because they do not want her to experience additional stress. But finally, I was arrested by the police for shoplifting. I could never forget the look on her face when I saw her while she was bailing me out. Beneath the wrinkles, paleness and tiredness on her face, her disappointment was apparent. She was weak, in a wheelchair and was supposed to go for her usual check up that day. But she missed it because of me. 

I realised that I was being selfish the whole time. I realised that I was thinking about myself and my own suffering, without realising that my mom was the one who was suffering the most. Additionally, my sister was starting to be influenced by me because her teacher called me and informed me that she had skipped school without an MC or letter. 

I soon picked myself up, took my N levels, and scored well enough to take the O levels. My mom's condition started to get better as well. I stopped hanging out with bad company, and my teachers helped by giving me tuition in their free time. 

I took my O levels. I had the goal of going to a good JC. But it was my second last O level paper, when one of my teacher approached me after the end of the paper. She told me the news. That my mom had passed away while I was taking the exam. My whole came crashing down again. 

With that news, I could not focus on my last paper the next day. I did not score well enough to go to the JC I wanted, and ended up going to Poly. My life, once again, went downhill. It felt pointless to keep trying. It felt like I tried my best to be good, yet life just was not fair towards me. And with my mom gone, I did not have the motivation to study anymore. 

While waiting for the Poly semester to start, I went through one of my darkest period. I was contemplating death every single day. There were some nights when I was very close to going through with my suicide plan. 

What got me out of it was during one of those suicidal nights, I entered my sister's bedroom to put a note on her desk. She did not hear not hear me coming in, and I heard what sounded like crying noise. You see, my sister never cried or showed much emotions. During my mom's funeral, there was no expression on her face. But that day, hearing her cry, I realised that she was hurting just as much as I am. And if I were to die, the pain I experienced would not just end with me. It's be transferred to my sister, and that was the most selfish thing I could do.

I started to have a new motivation in live. My sister. I pulled through poly, juggling with a part-time banquet job during the weekends. And just like that, I made it through poly, and into university because of my good grades. 

We had some help from our relatives, but it was never enough for us. My sister needed school supplies, and I needed textbooks and to pay off my poly tuition fee. My social life was not the best, because I could not keep up with going out with the clique every week and spending money with them when they choose to eat pricier food. Fortunately, I made a few good friends who understood my situation. They always opt for budget options, or insisted on paying for me. One of them had a sibling who was studying in the same secondary school as my sister and was a year older, and he gave me his sibling's old textbooks, supplies and even school uniform. 

There were times when I felt like I was going downhill again, but when I looked back at how far I came, I find the courage to continue on. From someone who was arrested for shoplifting, to someone studying at NUS.

This year, I finally graduated. I was not the best in my cohort, with only a second-lower class, but it meant a lot that I graduated. 

On my graduation day, I did not attend the ceremony. Instead, I went to the place where my mom's urn was kept, in my graduation gown (I didn't care that people were staring), and stayed there while the ceremony was going on. That day was the closest I've ever felt to my mom. She always told me her biggest regret in life was not getting an education and did not want her children to meet with the same regret. I hope that wherever she is, she'd be proud. 

Someday, I hope to go back to school and get a masters or phd. But for now, the best option is to find work first, because I want my sister to go through life a little more comfortably than I did. But someday, I'll make my mom even prouder.

In primary school, people called me all sorts of names e.g. ahgua, guniang, sissy etc just because of my more feminine moves. I brushed all of that off because I know all their opinions were not important as I am who I am. 

As I start to mature, I started to realise I am interested in both male and female. Whenever I am walking on the streets, I would be checking people from both genders out. I would be stealing a glance at them and thinking how good would it be if I could also get a partner just like them, be in love etc. 

As I grow up in a conservative family, I am unable to voice out or to vent my frustrations at people, not even my friends. I have never told anyone about my sexual preferences. Even I, as the owner of this body, denied the fact that I am actually a bisexual. I cheated myself into believing that I am straight, and this constant suppression of desires had myself depressed and really introverted during my teenage years. However, deep down I know I am actually a bisexual. I would then cry myself into sleep, wondering why am I different from what the society perceived a male should like.  

As I enter poly, I met more people. I see people from all walks of life, be it straight, bisexual, homosexual etc. And I remember it was one fine day, on my way to school, a thought came across my mind. If I intend to keep my sexual preference as a secret forever, and if I continue to deny the fact that I am a bisexual, isn't it very pathetic as you don't even recognise and acknowledge yourself for who you really are? Because if you don't even accept for who you are, how are you expecting other people to accept who you are too should you tell them about your sexual preferences in the future? From then on, I start to accept myself for who I am and I am happier and contented with life since.

Although I still don't have a partner as of now to adore me, at least I appreciate who I am, and I love myself more as compared to the past. 

I just wanted to share my story. I hope to let everyone knows that there is this group of people in LGBT society who are still suffering internally. Not because of how you think of them, but how they think of themselves. Just because society sets the standards and all of us believes in it, this group of people just follow blindly and thought the standards was ""right"", thinking that the outliers (like them) were ""wrong"". Truth is, society isn't always right. Only if we could all think deeper, be a little compassionate and stand from a different viewpoint. Maybe, just maybe, the world would be a nicer place. Thank you for reading this post :)

165,"To #75073. Offering a guy's perspective to your 6 years relationship.

You said you weren't the best looking while your partner is, while you turned from secure to insecure in the relationship. Seems to me that a likely reason your bf fell for you was because of your personality, likely because he was attracted to how confident and secure you were at the time.

Now if you can't trust him and am insecure all the time, I think this is going to push him away from you. Seems to me he takes the effort to explain to you what those girls are texting him, this is not something every guy would bother to do to their girlfriend. And an active step from his part to build trust.

He can't change his looks, and any person who wants to cheat will cheat- this isn't a looks matter. Imo you have to work on your insecurities, if not it is you yourself who will ultimately be ending the relationship anyway- through your very own actions.

But in the past, what our parents or grandparents learnt is how to fix it, rather than just throw it away and 'buy' a new relationship. If you have been approaching it wrong, it shouldn't be 'you don't deserve him or her', but 'let's work and see how you can change'. We are all work in progress, and the same goes for our partners. We should always try to fix it first, before discarding our relationships.

168,"Long post ahead. Just needed to rant and seek some advice.
I have this girlfriend clique from long ago. We’ve been together for more than a decade already.  I sincerely missed those days when all of us were still single ladies, where we would often arrange meetups for dinner and would treasure each others company. 

Now the problem comes when over the years, with each girlfriend finally finding a partner, I realised that all their attitude started to change. Now, don’t get me wrong, I am not jealous or anything, in fact I am truly happy for my friends who finally found a soulmate. From the bottom of my heart. Really. But what truly irks me is that the ones who are attached starts to slowly drift away from the clique, and often doing things that neglect the feelings of their girlfriends. Eg the clique has forever been planning to go for a short trip; to batam lets say, cos we havent had a chance to do so since we’ve been together. Then this one girlfriend can say “huh no $”, only to fly off to Japan with her boyfriend couple of months later. 

Then, there’s this other girlfriend. Before any of us dated, the clique has never emphasized so much on budget whenever we meet for dinner and to celebrate each others birthday. We just eat whatever we wanted to, cos what’s most important were the company we had back then. Now, whenever we do plan a dinner date/mini birthday celebration, people be like “budget please”.  Whats worse, when you see their insta story and they be like dining like queens with their boyfriends every other day (or sometimes every day). When its the clique’s turn to meet up once every 2/3 months, it becomes a budgeted affair. So now what, your decade long girlfriends become your budgeted friends already lah. Can eat good food with boyfriend all the time, but girlfriends not worth the time and penny to eat good food with?? Plus, we always plan a month or two ahead the birthday or dinner date, and people always gives excuses of being busy and all, it’s so darn hard to fix a date that everyone can make it. 

And then, every night (i swear) after work she’s having dinner with  her boyfriend  -.-  as seen from her insta story. THIS i cannot understand. 

To fellow girls, is this common in girl cliques or is it just mine. Why the need for double-standard, is it that difficult to prioritize both clique and boyfriend without upsetting either parties? Or is it that a decade long friendship means nothing to them anymore once they had a partner. Ain’t it like like burning bridges with friends who truly stood by their side since the beginning, long before that boyfriend of theirs existed??? To that, I always feel very sad and disappointed with these girlfriends. Is it right for me to go tell them out about their behaviour??

I'm a regular participant here. Sometimes really cuz I have nothing better to do on commutes because mobile games don't appeal to me.

But of late I find toxic comments and trolling to be the norm, even on posts where OP was obviously in distress and needed some kind of emotional support, encouragement, or just some advice.

""It's the internet"" you say. My faith in democracy died in 2016 with Trump and Brexit winning in the polls, and again with Boris Johnson winning in 2019. I think the internet remains the last unmolested vestige of unadulterated democracy, and yet again democracy has proven to me that it's not worth saving.

It saddens me to see democracy behind the cloak of anonymity so rotten to the core that we don't even have the basic human decency to be at least minimally civilised.

What's sadder is that we're supposed to be the cream of the crop, the exemplar of humanity. Or maybe just at the very least, not this very cesspool of toxicity. Surely that's not too much to ask!

This used to be a mutually supportive community, a relatively safe platform for people to voice opinions anonymously, or ask for help.

174,"Hello everyone,

I am a French girl currently on exchange at NUS, and I would like to share with you a bad experience that I had at one of the hawker centres on campus soon after I arrived, as I would like to know what Singaporeans would think about it. 

I am quite a health conscious girl, and I pay a lot of attention to what I eat, especially regarding the quality and sourcing of the primary ingredients; I want to know where the food comes from and for example for meat, in what conditions the animals were reared, for vegetables and rice if the producer uses organic and environmentally friendly farming methods, for eggs if they are free range, etc... 

So when I ordered some chicken rice at a stall, I asked the lady if she could tell me where the rice and the chicken came from, how they were reared, and if she knew the producer. She seemed really angry after I asked her the question, and started scolding at me in Singlish, and unfortunately (or fortunately maybe) I couldn’t understand what she was saying, but I interpreted it as “you are insulting me and my food, and if you are not happy, you can go find food elsewhere”. I want to make clear that I asked the question very politely and in a friendly way, and that I didn’t intend to hurt that lady in any way. However, don’t you think that it is normal to want to know where the primary ingredients of the food that you are eating are coming from? I mean food is your body’s fuel, and as Hippocrates said, “let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.”

I don’t understand her reaction, and I wanted to know if from a Singaporean point of view, my questions were seen as rude. In France, even in a small and simple family restaurant, asking this kind of question is not seen as rude at all, quite the opposite, as it shows the chef that you are interested in his work and appreciating his food by wanting to know more about it, and he/she will happily tell you about it. It is also quite frequent that restaurant owners, especially in the countryside, directly source their primary ingredients from the producer.

Also, I noticed that food culture in Singapore is very important (which is great, as it is the same in France, and I love that!), however, it seems to me that Singaporeans don’t pay a lot of attention to the origin and quality of the primary ingredients, which is a paradox to me as from good ingredients results tasty and healthy food. So to all Singaporeans, what do you think about this topic? Do you agree or disagree with me? 

Thanks for reading my long post, and don’t hesitate to let me know in the comments what you think about all that, and if you can relate to my experience!

From a French girl who loves Singapore, Singaporean food, and NUS!

The girl I like says she feels insecurities that ""I'm out of her league"" and that ""I may leave her"" for better girls. She says she feels average and there's no reason for me to like her. 

But I do. I find her attractive in her own way, but love is a funny thing and I find it hard to put it in words. I was taken aback and stunned, I didn't know what to say.  I struggled to give her a reply. I felt like it made her even more insecure that I gave her a general reply. 

How do I make her feel comfortable and trust that I'll not leave her? I feel like she's waiting for me to say something.

Although I have a small group of good friends from JC and high school I really do treasure a lot, I don't have a lot of friends in uni to hang out with and it has been like this since I was a freshman. Sometimes it is difficult to hang with my closer friends because of school and some of them are in relationships too. I used to have a boyfriend who has graduated from nus, but we broke up. So my question is, how do people cope with loneliness? Sometimes I feel so alone, I will just sit in my bed and cry. Sometimes it even brings my focus away from my academics. It is kinda hard at times too seeing others in happy and committed relationships, because I do crave the intimacy and commitment that comes with relationships. Some guys showed interest in me but I wasn't really into any of them and being with someone solely to fill this void isn't a great idea. I tried looking for friends online but we just didn't really hit it off. I have been attempting to work on myself - travelling overseas alone, working out, reading and planning my study schedule for this semester. Yet everyday I still fall asleep and wake up with this emptiness in my heart. The only times I don't feel this way is when I am having fun with my close friends, on vacation with my family or when I had my ex with me. How do people lead fulfilling single lives without feeling like they have to wait for people to hang with them or a boyfriend they can love to come along?

Vegan options are few. Expensive/atas-looking options so many. I think I can speak for the majority of us when I say that we really dont need so many weird (or the other extreme: repetitive) concepts to open on campus. We need honest vendors who are good, reliable, and relatively affordable. 

The stalls and vendors who make it a point to price their food and drinks affordably are so underrated. Cheap and good needs to be appreciated so much more, and I genuinely hope they dont get a hard time from the school landlords.

I was two-timed by an ex with cancer after I accompanied her through the treatment stage. 
Years later, I bore her outstanding study loan cos I was her guarantor.

As unwilling as I was, I just went took responsibility for what came.
Recently, I was hospitalised for an heart attack and am awaiting my bypass surgery with a 3% risk of death. 
I share these not for sympathy. Life isn’t about comparing whose life is shittier. I am just sharing that my life isn’t a bed of roses. I am not necessarily living a better life than you but I will be fine. 

I have always received messages from many whose lives aren’t beds of roses all along. There are many who shared that they can get more for their family with their limited Budget. It may sound unexpected but I have always read how some who are bedridden look at our posts to get connected to the world out there. Especially after I shared my condition, many silent friends got in touch with me to share their own experiences. Some have lost their loved ones. Some are suffering from some physical or mental conditions. 

Everyone has their own stories to live. Every story is unique. Many times, we are given challenges we need to face because those are tests to prepare us for greater things. Again, I am living my life story too. I totally understand how life gets shitty at times, how dark the outlook can be, how we don’t see light at the end of the tunnel at times.

This is written to every single friend who feels life hasn’t been the best to them. Hey, fight on. You are never alone. Someone in Singapore is fighting all his shitty situations too. Life is unfair in the fairest way. Your story will be a good one ultimately.

He literally using two accounts, one as the girlfriend (operating it himself/herself) and one as the boyfriend (operating himself/herself too) And the two accounts always tags each other on different post etc etc and it’s quite active de leh. For example he post a status, saying how cute his gf is. His gf will reply to that post wor. But actually both is same person, he talking to himself only.

183,"I am an evergreen, average looking, skinny guy (I would say that looks 5/10) who is single, but I am quite ashamed to say that I am single by my own requirements. I would appreciate if you guys can help to advise me on the following.

I have know this girl, A, since university days, and besides her less than ideal (would say around 4/10) face and figure, she has a great personality.

When we go out for dinner, she doesn't mind eating at the same place even though we have eaten at the same place just a couple of weeks ago. She knew that I fancied a K-Pop girl group and when she went overseas for vacation, she helped to purchase a merchandise of that girl group, and I was very surprised and touched by her action. 

She had a carefree outlook towards things in general, and shares  characteristics as me (sharing about books that we read, learning new things together, visiting libraries and bookstores, travel etc).
Despite her busy work schedule and colleagues who are not that good, she doesn't complain too much about work and takes things in her stride.

Recently, I have even picked up a new sport (tennis) that was foreign to me, and she was so patient in teaching me the basics of it. I truly enjoyed the time spent with her, and can't wait to see her again soon for more tennis. The thing is, when I went home, many different thoughts linger in my mind, and one of it was to advancing the friendship to a further relationship with her, while another opposing thought was that since she looked like what people would called as 'dinobu' , I myself have qualms about going further with her.

Sad to say, when I looked at the female friends around me who are single, I am ashamed to say that because of the high requirements that I have, (skinny and tall, great personality, caring etc), I am still single. It's going to be the end of 2019, and my mum would harp on the fact that people of my age (25)are already becoming parents. I would not want to get into a relationship just because of peer pressure, but seeing people around me are in relationships made me felt worse, and social media made it worse.

I am thankful that A is there to provide a supportive ear for me when I need it, such as career choice, assignment support back in university and so on. She would be someone whom I would say fits the bill of someone worth marrying because of her values and personality, but I am still having doubts about myself.

185,"For all the worried freshies out there, here's some advice my senior gave me on whether or not you should S/U your modules. It helped me decide and I hope it helps you, all the best & happy holidays!

1) If you score A+, A, or A-, please don't S/U that module. You'll need those grades to pull up your CAP.
2) If you score F, please just S/U (U) that module. You will have to retake the module or substitute with another module in another semester regardless and letting the F grade stand will affect your CAP. Drastically.
3) If you score C+ or C, you should S/U (S) that module. Those are probably the worst passing grades you are going to get.

4) If you score D+ or D, Take note that if you do S/U (U) that module, you will need to overload another semester to retake that module (or substitute with another module). The good thing is that this U grade will not affect your CAP now. However, if you decide to keep the grade, then you will not need to overload for this module but it will affect your CAP (D+ and D give 1.5 and 1.0 respectively). So it is really your choice here of whether to rid a bad grade and overload later, or really push urself harder for the other modules. 

5) Finally, if you score B+, B, B-, aha this is really difficult, and there is no one-size-fits-all answer. It really depends on what is your target CAP at the end of your 4 years. For example, if you intend to get 2nd Lower (3.50 - 3.99), then you should keep the B+ (4.0) and S/U (S) the B- (3.0). Surprisingly, it makes no difference to the Honours Class whether you keep or S/U (S) the B (3.5). This gives you a ""safety net"" to play with. If you intend to get 2nd Lower but are scared to drop to 3rd Class (3.20 - 3.49), then keep the B. If you think you have some chance to push to 2nd Upper (4.00 - 4.49), then S/U (S) the B.

6) One more thing! Contrary to popular belief, your overall CAP is weighted per module (or MCs to be more precise), not per semester. If you get 5.00 this sem (by S/U-ing all except your only A) and 4.00 next sem (e.g. getting B+ for every module), your overall CAP after 2 semesters is NOT 4.50 but will be lesser (probably 4.17). This shows that the CAP is calculated based on the modules, not based on the semester. So don't think you'll have a free ride by S/U-ing everything except your only A, because you will suffer in the later semesters.

tl;dr: S/U all C's and F's. Keep all A's. As for B's, ask yourself what CAP you want to achieve. If u aiming for 1st class, SU all B+ and below. If aiming for 2nd upper, SU all B and below, keep ur B+
In case anyone finds this useful ????

186,"Hi I need some advice here. I have broken up with my first gf of 4 years and on rare times, I still find myself thinking about her even though we had broken up for about 2 years now and I have had 2 relationships since then (all lasted about 3-4 months). She was the first for everything (kiss, holding hands, meeting my parents, sex, we even went to see a house tgt) and the first woman that I ever thought of marrying and she has been with me through my most difficult times (NS, JC, and university). 

I will give you a little backstory before asking for the actual advice so bear with me. 

I got into a relationship pretty late at about 20 years old. The love we got for each other was pure. So pure that it is almost selfless. Our honeymoon period lasted all the way until I had to leave overseas for a work trip of 1 year. We were madly in love so we thought we could pull through but we ended breaking up because we were bad at communicating when I was overseas and time difference and distance just made everything a lot harder to rectify. I wanted to work things out when I am back but I think she already made the decision long ago and was dead set on breaking up with me and I couldn't change her mind. 

This left a dent in my heart. She being my first love and lasting for 4 years to the point that we were planning our marriage crushed me. I became so much more wary of love. I dated 2 other girls after her in the past two years and the feeling was so different. 

The first girl that I dated after my ex made me realise that I am less selfless and more wary in love. She was a nice girl but we were both fresh out of a long 4 years relationship which was kinda a recipe for disaster. Needless to say, we didn't work out. 

The second girl that I dated crushed my self-esteem. Her ex was a really rich guy and she is one who enjoys an expensive gift. She is not a gold digger because she buys me equally expensive gifts. it's just that her lifestyle was hard to keep up. Her parents also kinda picked on my background/ status which made me questioned my self-worth. 

All these failures in the relationship made me feel like maybe It's my own problems. Maybe I am not worthy of love. idk. 

I want to ask advice from someone who maybe had a similar experience - breaking up with someone they love for 4 years or more. How did you recover from that? I find myself unable to give the same kind of selfless and unconditional love similar to the one that I gave my first and it worries me. How can I love selflessly again?

It was sort of our honeymoon period and he had to enlist recently. While I'm feeling a sudden sense of emptiness during this transition phase, I believe he is having a tougher time inside. With the limited texting we have, I am a bit lost on what can I do or say to encourage and support him throughout. I kind of realised there's nothing much I can do to help.

Furthermore, I am not expecting him to spend all of his book-out time with me as he will probably be tired, need to rest, get some me-time or spend it with his friends or family. Hence, I'm thinking of just having a shorter, non-strenuous date like a simple bonding over meal, but will this get mundane overtime?

Any advice on how to cope with this transition is very much appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Booked the place weeks ahead and settled reservation etc. I also paid for the meal. Anyway, the day came and I reminded him to wear swee since it's a posh place, but he turned up looking like he just woke up from bed/didn't put in much thought into dressing. I know he's the clueless kind when it comes to fashion but it really dampened my mood to know I was the only one who was excited enough to dress up properly. Plus I booked and researched everything while he just went with the flow and paid $0. Dk if I'm bf or gf, my life hard sia. Is it must buy flowers for him ????

Mood soured and I chided him (as usual, not the first time) and I felt incredibly tired to be emotionally charged when all I wanted was a nice evening with him + I was damn hungry. Am really sick of his attitude even though he always tells me he will try harder, and that he's not taking me for granted.

Any advice? I've tried making him watch YT vids (not receptive) or even telling him exactly what to wear, but he didn't iron them! ???? Need smth to wake up his idea if not I cannot tahan le.

Everyone should know what consequences they will face in the future, if girls don't blowdry their hair so I'm constantly getting her to do it. Considering how stubborn she always is, , she would get frustrated but, still do so, unwillignly. So I kinda got tired nagging at her and didn't do so the last 3 days. The weird thing is, as I was using my phone on the bed, she stepped out the toilet, stood there with her wet hair, stared at me for a good 10s-ish, pouted and asked, ""why never asked me to blow dry? Faster tell me to do so....."" and I did as what she told me to.

Here is the question, what am I supposed to do? Cos when I tell her to do so, she gets annoyed, when I keep quiet, don't say anything, I'm not even angry or anything, simply minding my own business, she want me to 'nag' at her.

200,"I’m a year 1 student from NUS and new to dating. Wanted to ask this... I feel the guy I am dating is not very into me. He does things for me like send me home, listen to my problems if I have any and makes time for me despite being very busy. He shows me what he is doing usually so I will rule out the possibility that he is cheating. Anyway he seems very emotionally distant. For example, when I am down he doesn’t pay attention unless I ask for it, if I’m sick he does not do anything other than send me a message, and he only makes time for me because I asked for it or listen to my problems only if I ask for it. So basically he only does things if I ask for it... and when he meet ups with me he is not excited for it. Every single time I talk to him about this, he will say that he is already putting in effort like send me back (which is actually because it’s on the way) but due to that I will not comment further because it is true that he sent me back. Is it normal to be emotionally distant but yet still like a person? We have been dating for around 8 months, could this be the reason? He also admitted being a not so emotional person, do such people exists? Can someone please explain what does this mean? Please do not be mean haha I’m genuinely asking.

I saw the messages between my gf of 3 years and another guy, 
pop up on her laptop.
All the juicy detail,
all the 'massages' 
that they give each other. 
The love confessions 
front and back at each other,
Like lovebirds, who have found each other.
All that, over the weekends. 
No wonder, why she never came home. 
After our last arguments, and off she went.
All my messages,
became double blue ticks.

Today,

My heart is shattered,
to a thousand pieces.
My chest tightened, pushing out all the air in my lungs.
My clenched fists, looking for something to smash.
My persistent coughing, which had lasted for a few days
suddenly healed. As if there is another pain
Excruciating pain. That nothing can match.

I want to scream, but out came nothing.
I want to cry, but no tears flowing.
All that lies within,
is now, 
emptyness.

Today,

I have realised. 
Love is blind,

And nothing lasts forever.
3 years went by,
blood, joy, sweat, tears.
""Let's travel around the world together""
she said.

But I think, With whatever sanity I have left,
to reckon.
There is a silver lining in every sad story.
She may have found true love.
While I, starting every thing
all over again.

211,"Hey #83772

Hi there, I decided to respond to your qn: what ruins a healthy long term relationship

Anonymously. Because I want to be truthful.

Truth is, a lot of “luck” is involved. Yes you read that right. 

I for one have a child and a loving wife. We are married for more than ten years. But there were so many times the stability which I built everything upon (condo, career, car, etc) was so easy to just recklessly abandon to my “luck” of attracting the attention of someone of the opposite sex I could only have dreamed of. 

Of course I will do no evil to destroy what good I have built for myself any my family. Yes I sound irresponsible to even mention it but it is that easy to ruin a long term relationship. Because it feels like “luck” than “misfortune”. 

How do you avoid this? You can’t. You simply have to possess a very rewarding relationship to the point it makes little “economical” sense to abandon your stable relationship. I find that treasuring a long term relationship is much harder than short ones because we take “today” for granted. Cannot have dinner today? Nvm tmr. Cannot go holiday this year? Nvm next yr. You will be around me wat. 

No no no. Never assume. 

One golden rule I learnt is that I should never look at a relationship based on months or years, but just today. Am I happy with the relationship? Am I contributing to the relationship? What can I do about it? But I never question if the other party is contributing to the relationship. Because if that is actually a question in your head, YOU GOT THE WRONG PERSON MATE. Really, you have no control over how much the other half contributes to the relationship. It is like an “inborn” thing that cannot be tutored or nagged into the brain. So naturally, this gives you a good hint on what to look for in a potential partner in a long term relationship: a person who is constantly finding ways to contribute to the relationship WITHOUT PROMPT from you. Seems rare to find such a person and if you do, it cannot be ruined right? WRONG. It is a lot easier to take for granted and even easier to ruin than an unrewarding relationship. Because we do take good things for granted. 

How easy it is to ruin a long term relationship even when both are deeply invested in the relationship? Here are some tried and tested tricks from my divorced friends:

A sacarstic tease here, a spurt of “bloody fool” or “lazy pig”, a wall of anger with a few “don’t even touch me” day here and there, a few rant of complaints doubting the loyalty of your better half spilled to mutual friends... the sort that you tell everyone except your other half, etc.... these can really build up over time and sometimes “luck” just checks in to see how you are- and becomes the hay that breaks the camel’s back. 

Let me tell you about this “luck”. I call it “luck” because that is exactly how it feels when you are at the maginot line of self-destruction. 

When you build yourself up like a fortress, you do “luckily” attract attention of the... sexual kind. It can come from varying sources but because they are “by chance” moments it is always easier to say no than to succumb to it. But really easier said than done when the initiating party gets bolstered by your confusion and advances steadily. I hate myself for letting my imagination run wild sometimes and I usually dive deeper into my work to stop the nonsense spilling into reality. I have also developed a wall of party tricks to avoid these disasters because I really value the loyalty of my wife and I believe she deserves nothing less. 

Some of my friends weren’t so lucky. So which sex more guilty one ah? is it husband or wife more? Nowadays sama-sama. How old are the relationships? Got kids involved, in primary schools. Terrible when you think, but really, in the eyes of the beholder, they were simply rationalizing a strode of “luck” that fell on their lap. 

I never even put money/debt or sudden health issue (e.g. car accident) or nasty relatives (the sibling who always come and spill trouble) into the equation and long term relationship is already so easy to ruin. 

So treat every relationship that comes to you as fragile as a wine glass. It will bring you happiness when the daily grind ends with a free flow of “wine” falling from the sky every night without fail (“wine” here refers to a satisfying happiness which stability brings at the end of the day). Those who have glass will fill it to the brim and sip over supper with their partner. 

But if you meet people that likes to smash your glass into pieces all the time? Well you just gotta find someone mature enough to enjoy a glass of wine every night, not a berzerker who smashes your life and hopefully he/she can be tamed someday to do this long term relationship thing. A few sips of this “free” wine really change your life and show you how beautiful life can be when savored in its simplest elements as a reflection of your memories.

221,"How do u tell whether a boss is practicing favouritism in the workplace and how do u counteract that?

Headsup, this is quite a long post ahead. 

I am an executive working in a global firm. There are also 4 other executives (ie same rank), and we are all quite similar in terms of educational background, with 1 - 2 yrs difference in age. The skillsets we have are also broadly the same, but  because we work on different projects, there are some differences in the kind of exposure and experience we had.

I've noticed that my boss is particularly nice to one of the executives (let's just call the person A). Now don't get me wrong, my boss is generally friendly and will smile/talk to others in a calm manner, not like those horrible bosses u see in movies.

By acts of niceness I mean: by giving A opportunities to speak up, only asking for A's views in meetings, letting A run the bigger projects most of the time, following up with A when A comes back from holidays and asking A whether A feels overwhelmed, need more staffing resources etc etc.

Even though it feels like my boss sometimes 'wakes up' and treats the other executives better as well (like asking if we also need resources or spends effort coaching us), I can't help but feel that boss prefers A based on the number of times that boss is nice to A. I am guessing that it is because the only difference between the rest of us and A is that - A is homegrown ie has started career in this firm and stayed on throughout. A is not the most experienced (in terms of number of years working in this line) amongst us. This 'loyal' trait is very similar to my boss' own background - staying in one firm throughout, while the rest of us started our careers elsewhere before moving to the present firm. Plus because there was a period of time when we had massive turnover, it seems to me that the boss is afraid of people leaving and therefore feels that only homegrown employees are loyal will stay long and can be groomed.

If this continues, I'm concerned that when it comes to promotions, pay rise and general career progression, the boss will favour A too, since A gets the best exposure, best resources and best learning experience and naturally would perform better. Is this considered favouritism in such situations, and what can I do for myself and my career? Prof Ben, any wise words?

222,"<Warning: long post ahead about my childhood and grief>

In my childhood, I saw my aunt (my mother’s younger sister) as my second mother. My parents didn’t have much time for me as they both held demanding jobs, my father works in an MNC and my mother was in banking. Since I was 3 years old, I lived with my grandmother on the weekdays and I spent certain weekends with my aunt or she’d visit me at my grandma’s house. 

I remember the times I spent at her place tending to the mini vegetable garden outside her house, baking desserts in her kitchen and numerous outings. My aunt compiled a photo album for the many photos we took during the time we spent together. She also made me promise to confide in her, and if there’s anything I didn’t want my mother to know, I could go to her. 

As she and her husband were childless then, I secretly wished that she was my mother instead. It wasn’t till I was 8, when my mother became a housewife and I began living with my parents (and forged a strong relationship with them since). Still, I remained close to my aunt. Every CNY I looked forward to seeing her most, often finding ourselves talking for hours 1-to-1 until it was time to leave.

In JC, I came home from school and my mum told me my aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer. She ate very healthily, exercised, and ensured the whole family that she was feeling better each day. However, within 3 years she lost a lot of weight, just skin and bones. She was wheelchair-bound (she called it her batmobile) towards the last several months of her life.

At the beginning of 2015 (Y1S2), my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer too, and I cried really hard at the hospital because I was afraid of the possibility of losing her. A few months later (Y2S1), my mum undergone a major surgery. I was very worried, crying my eyes out, praying that she won’t die. My aunt suggested that I stay over at her place so that she could comfort me with “warm soup and hugs” (her exact words). I declined the offer as I was studying for finals and that was the worst decision I made in my life.

My aunt died a few weeks later, which shocked me deeply. I stared into blank space for an hour outside her ward as the whole family sorted out her funeral. When my other aunts tidied her home, they found the photo album from my childhood that she’s been keeping all these years. My grandma said my aunt told her that she flips through my childhood album once in a while. I like to believe that perhaps back then she wished that I was her daughter too.

Over the next 2 semesters, my grades suffered and I questioned the purpose of life, falling into depression. I cried almost every night for around 5 months in the privacy of my bedroom so my parents wouldn’t know. Eventually, I got better with counselling, my parent’s support and my CCA commitments. My mother also recovered from cancer.

Today (13 Dec) marks the 4th anniversary since my dear aunt died. Not a day goes by that I don’t think about her. I still cry occasionally when I miss her (like right now as I am writing this). I realized how short life is and I am immensely grateful that my mother is alive today because I think I’d lose the will to live if she had died too.

However lately, she started getting paranoid about lying after seeing some of her cousins’ relationships wrecked because of lying. She even demanded that whoever caught lying in our relationship will be fined by the other person. To reassure her, I agreed.

Then for some ridiculous reasons, she started fining me a few times for “lying”. The most ridiculous fine was when I blurted out during an argument that she spent more time meeting her good guy friends than meeting me. She said I was lying because I didn’t take into account the other time she spent thinking about me but choosing to compare only the time physically meeting. 

I was incensed and demanded that she give me a breakdown on how much time she spent thinking about her good guy friends compared to that spent thinking about me. At this point she said she can give me the breakdown, but she counter-questioned me about my intentions for asking and implied that I don’t trust her even though she always has my back blah blah blah. She still refuses to give the breakdown. 

Should I get out of this relationship? I know I probably still have value on the dating market because some other girl has persistently pursued me (but she has money management issues). But after all, my gf and I have been together for some time and we are familiar with each other.

In Y1, I fell in love with the beaches here in SG (especially Sentosa), and I had two friends who were siblings (brother and sister) who always accompanied me to the beach. The carefree times playing in the water are times I look back fondly upon. These friends also defended me when I was targeted unfairly by a jealous student who said that he had to beat me at all my modules (I really didn't understand his deal but ok).

In Y2, I met this tough girl who was uncompromising but loyal, yet she also had a difficult past in terms of her parents being overprotective over her. She helped me in one particularly difficult Geography Module that I had to take. This was also the period where I started to develop feelings for one of the siblings, though I was too afraid to tell her.

In Y3, The jealous student turned out to be misunderstood the whole time as it was actually his father who set him on this wrong path. He had a deep interest in cooking, and I learnt a lot of good recipes from him (he also taught me dancing).

So I find it unsettling that companies are applauded for stopping to give away straws or plastic bags. I mean aren't they the ones benefitting the most out of this. 

First, I believe companies could reduce some cost from this campaign(I know the amount is insignificant but money is money). Second, they could gain some PR exposure out of this. I am not saying that I disagree with the campaign but they are the ones offering those things in the first place as some form of ""complimentary service"" to the customer, so technically omitting those ""complimentary service"" (and not giving away alternative in place of this) only benefit their side.

If these companies would say like they would donate the money that they could have used for getting those straws or plastic bag then that is something that could be applauded but I have never heard something like this before. So I guess the whole stuff more like PR campaign?

What are your thoughts?

231,"Dear prof Ben and his whispers community,

My gf, my guy friend and I were having lunch. My gf and my friend suddenly had a debate over feminism and the role of women in the family. Not knowing what to do, I just remained silent and smiled diplomatically. At the end of the conversation, my gf hinted that I am taking the same side as my friend. She seems mad at me now, but she didn't bring up anything about that convo afterwards. She still seems mad 

I was honestly just lost and I have no idea what to say. I kept quiet to not take sides and remain a neutral party.

Guys, what would you have done if you're in my shoes?

245,"#74972 Apologies for an equally long post. Readers please ignore rambling from somewhat old graduates.  

To the unappreciated peer, given you have worked 7.5 years and 2 jobs or more, I assumed that you would have learnt that's just life. So I'm not sure what type of answers that you are seeking.  Anyway I have worked exactly the same no. of years and jobs as you, although I have probably benefited from favoritism instead of suffered from it in both firms.  Some thoughts off my mind.

-Your way of doing work/thinking sound a bit overly focused on KPIs or being too robotic? Being too much of a robot can peeve your boss, so maybe you should rework and reduce your one-way speaking sessions. Networking may help in overall career progression, but it is beyond those 1-1 sessions. I have never really paid too much attention to it though.  

-The way towards promotion and career goal is less structured , it is not like playing a game. It is not a case of talk to people > find quests > complete quests > earned experience > level up. Don't be too obsessed with the ""how to"". Your way of interacting with people, the work you do (if it is good) and etc will naturally form the foundation of your career progression. 

-Your method of being hard to replace is wrong. Unnecessary overtime (e.g. standby during public holidays), and doing too many saikang will simply sap your energy and do not count towards your employee value. You're a hardworking and perhaps somewhat important employee, but not A-team / inner circle. We also have a long working life ahead of us, and official retirement age will keep getting extended. Bro, take a chill pill.

-Saikang / special projects's importance may increase at higher level, but its real value is really as an office politics (OP) tool such as proving value to CEO, proving value over other departments. I did some and still gives my best since it is still BAU and everyone has to do some saikang. But I have never been too ardent to use it to get into the right people's good books. I don't deny that it is a good way to get promotion, but the OP road is too overpowering for me.  

-Never neglect your real work over saikang, do a few if you have to or inevitable. Being good in your real work may not be the most important consideration in promotion in some organisations. But thankfully, this approach is good enough for me in both firms. In addition, the skills/knowledge built from real work are the transferable skill sets. The winning sensation you get from gaming the OP is not transferable. But if you do intend to stay within the firm for life, you probably will have to invest some skill points into OP..

-Homegrown is obviously important, but being non-homegrown will not be a limiting factor except in organisations which being pure-blood vampires are important as a firm culture. Private organisations are generally better. Are you given sufficient opportunities, are you given proper work? Make use of what you have. 

-Human relationship is complicated. Frequency, personalities and etc play a part. You can't be best buddies with all the quest givers unlike in a game. 

-Quit if you have to or it is too extreme. If you are a quality employee and thus feeling unappreciated for good reasons, lack of appreciation is a small issue. Don't brood over it too much. Happiness > everything.

But she didn't, she started tearing up and apologising to me for not being able to fufil my wish instead. At that moment, as much as I pity her, I just can't control my anger and walked off.

Honestly, I don't know why am I so jealous about this no longer existent guy, but it just irks me that she constantly avoids things that she used to love. According to her sister and her friends, she used to love playing the guitar, eating prawn mee, watching volleyball matches, riding a bicycle etc. All of these were her hobbies that she used to do with her deceased ex and she doesn't do it now, as it simply reminds her of him. I know it is very heartbreaking for someone you'd loved to die in an accident and suddenly, you lost him in a blink of an eye, but I guess the devil inside me made me so harsh towards her and I'm so guilty.

Just yesterday, she texted me and I was rather happy because we haven't been texting for a week since that incident. However, it was a break up text. She dumped me. I know it's my fault but in the text, she kept apologising and taking all the blame. She mentioned that she isn't good enough for me and wished me atb. At that point of time, I was devastated, I regretted my actions, I really don't want to lose this wonderful girl, but I can't control how I feel towards that guy. Help me. How am I suppose salvage this relationship. I'm super lost right now and I miss her.

I am an incoming exchange student from the UK. I know that Singapore is a very developed country, but there is something that I have been unable to wrap my head around. I have a question about the drinking water supply in Singapore.

I heard that Singapore uses waste water (a.k.a. “s**t water”) as one of its source of water supply. May I know if nus is located in one of the districts which uses this waste water? If the answer is yes then I’ll make sure I buy bottled water every day I’m here. 

Additionally, may I know how do you use these waste water for your daily needs? Specifically at which step of the water do you withdraw waste water from to shower, wash clothes etc? For example, if I want to obtain water to shower, should I scoop water out from the toilet reservoir, toilet bowl, or pipes beneath the sink?

Thank you in advance, and I look forward to seeing all of you in Singapore!

255,"I'm the OP of #74946, the one asking for ways to counteract workplace favouritism.

To provide abit more context (I really want to solve this issue I guess):

- No, my boss and Person A are not sleeping together FOR SURE. They are the same gender, both got their own families with children. 

- I've actually been with the firm for 5 years already. Person A has been with the firm for 6.5 years. For a mere 1.5year difference, I don't think the ROI matters that much. In fact, I was at my previous firm for 2.5 years and being with my current firm double the number of years speak volumes about my willingness to stay and stick around. To allay my boss' distrust, I've mentioned multiple times that I won't leave and I'm also bonded (the firm pays for all my upgrading qualifications, which I've continuously been taking for the past 5 years to better prep myself while Person A didn't) as a sign of my commitment. 

- And yes, I talk to my boss whether it's work-wise or personal-wise or career-wise. I have multiple projects with my boss. My boss knows my ultimate career goal - communicated it across several times, knows I'm working hard towards it and I will personally schedule time to talk about career progression, my views on the team (I already lead one), how we can do better, and just general catch up on life - I do notice that these sessions seem to be abit one-sided though, like it's coming alot more from my own proactiveness and initiative. Of course Person A does it too, but the boss always seem more receptive (like in a better mood after coming back from these coffee sessions with Person A).

- I've also tried being ""hard to replace"" like how one commenter mentioned - I put my hand up most frequently, do the projects that no one wants to do, standby during public holidays, help out with business development and things generally to be done outside of work hours (otherwise known as saikang lol), help out whenever the team is busy, and my juniors have given me glowing reviews year after year. These are things that Person A does not have. 

It has come to a point where I feel that I've tried hard and things are stagnated, for reasons beyond my comprehension and control. I'm really unsure what else I have to do to appease my boss, and sometimes I feel like a slave/taken for a ride. 

Tts why I feel that at the end of the day, nothing I've done will satisfy my boss, and nothing I do moving forward will. I'm not sure if anybody here has ever been in my shoes and managed to turn things around, if so, would really love to hear from u. Oh and thanks for reading, oops another long post.

It seemed mutual. I thought we had a thing but it turns out she just completely ghosted me during the vacation. 

We were so close during the semester. I don't understand why she ghosted me. She seemed very genuine during the semester. Not like the kind of girl with a motive. 

But right now when I try to talk to her she'll seem cold and uninterested. We used to talk every day. Now she's not initiating convos and when I do, she'll give me one word replies. She seems like she doesn't want this anymore.

Sometimes it makes me feel like I'm just being annoying and I trying to talk to her is just pestering her. It feels stupid trying to talk to her when she doesn't want to talk. I don't know what happened or if it's something I did wrong. 

Right now, I don't know how to continue this 'relationship'. It's hard to continue when the other person is making it feel 'one-way' even tho it used not be. And it's hard to let her know how I feel or ask her directly since we are not exactly boyfriend girlfriend.

What should I do? How should I continue treating her? How do I get things to be like the way it used to? Should I continue helping her if she approaches me for homework help again? idk if im being used or if it's just a misunderstanding. I still like her a lot

265,"Hi. I have been working for about 3 years after graduation, and I can really sense the growing generation gap in Singapore. You don't feel it much interacting in school, where we tend to respect and treat each other as equals. (Would suck if your circle of friends don't) But when you step into society, there are some really serious dysfunction in action.

(Disclaimer, I don't mean that all from the older generation are like that, but enough of them to ruin your experience in society and question your faith in humanity)

It begins with the parents. Asking for help with technology. At first, they seem reasonable and I don't mind helping. But then they start bugging you at the most inopportune moment, when you're writing an email, when you're are rushing for a work deadline. Followed by the ""I have raised you for 20 years, and you can't even help me with just this 1 small thing?"" Even though this is the 20th time I have guided them to download photos from their phone, or to escape the digital tv menu screen.

It doesn't get any better at work. How a finance/IT manager manage to even survive at their job without decent Excel skills elude me. How they just assume fresh grads would be better than them at Excel reeks of intentional helplessness. Especially when none of us ever learnt it in school. Fine, I get it that we're more IT savvy than the older generation. But darn it, this is your world too. Learn to explore it!

All this just erodes your willingness to help others. Because by rewarding such behaviour, they'll just bother you more frequently. Not only would you be giving yourself more work, you'll eventually be doing work that is rightfully theirs. At least this is still tolerable for those who appreciate your efforts, but...

Enter those senior members of the company/community who look down upon anyone of a lower position. They won't even bother to hide the disdain they feel towards you. The more discreet of them would spread gossip about you. But you may happen to encounter that self-respecting kind who would literally shove you aside to exert dominance or demand respect.

And it doesn't help that these people usually surround themselves with yesmen. Perhaps the long term results of the organisational structure or culture. The more benign ones would just close their eyes to abuse of authority, complicit in their silence. Then there are those who would take every opportunity to flaunt devotion to their superiors, treating any utterances as words of wisdom. And when you want to chime in to the conversation, they would tell you off for disrespecting your elders. 

Sigh... it is just so demoralising working with such people. I am truly sympathetic to the Ok Boomer movement.

I chanced upon conversations, obscene pictures and interactions with multiple girls. Basically he cheated. So he begged for my forgiveness after finding out that I knew, and asked me for another chance. I forgave him very easily to be honest, I thought that he would change. Fast forward to today, I know it’s wrong to check his phone but I just wanted to find out if he has actually changed, so I did. To my horror, he was messaging different girls on Instagram flirting and asking them for their telegram handles. So I checked his telegram too, and apparently he archived many conversations with different girls, muting them so that I’d never find out. Their conversations were so flirty, definitely not between two normal friends. My boyfriend and I went to watch Star Wars with my family last Saturday. And he claimed to the girls that he watched alone? Why is he trying to hide? Furthermore, he complained about me to them, without letting them know the context that he actually cheated on me. Now I’m like the bad guy. What should I do now? He don’t know I’ve checked his phone, though it was wrong, but it’s probably a blessing in disguise. Things will never change huh?

I was young at 18 and I met him. We were so attracted to each other almost instantly. MSN was a thing that time, and we could chat for hours literally every single day. He asked me to be his girlfriend on Christmas Day and I said yes. This was despite knowing that he will be leaving the country in a year; he will be moving overseas and I am most definitely not. There were ups and downs throughout the relationship; it was not a healthy one. We were too young to know how to handle conflicts, and too immature to understand commitment. Among the things we talked about, we said that we would marry each other. At that time, it felt like he was ‘the one’, and he felt the same way too. Time wasn’t the kindest, we grew apart along with the physical distance. In the second year of the LDR, he told me one night that he was falling for someone else.. As immature as I was, I screamed. I was livid. I was heartbroken. Nothing could be done to rewind that moment, or mend that was already broken. I did all that stupid things: hung up on him then tried calling back, only to have my calls rejected; spammed him with lots of messages and received no replies; go from “f u” to a miserable apology... He blocked me eventually and through those days of silence, it was a chance to thoroughly examine myself. I learnt that there is no right or wrong in a breakup; relationship is a dance which takes two to tango. Anyone has the right to leave. He gave me a closure eventually, which I’m grateful for. He returned, we talked, and parted ways “officially”. As I re-look at an old diary, I’m surprised that today is exactly the 6th year since we parted. Perhaps this explains that weird feeling that I get today. 

To the brokenhearted, the rebuilding phase may be long and trying. It took me a full year before I was actually happy again. Do what you need to do, and I hope that you will find the way and the will to move onwards. Happy holidays.

Seems like bragging rights? Or a way to identify yourself? If you remove your sch, uni course affiliations, what's your identity? Do you have an identity that is separate from the institution? Are you going to keep your sch and course after 5 years of working? Why do it now then?

Have you got nothing to say about yourself that you have to rely on your course branding?

276,"I see many people recommending volunteering to meet new people etc. But honestly I personally cannot fathom how people can like, voluntarily do volunteer work (if that makes sense), because my volunteering experience in school from CIP has totally made these activities feel repulsive. Being forced to go for these CIP activities and having a quota to reach is already bad enough, but what makes it worse is the actual volunteering experience. For example, in old folks' homes and nursing homes, you have to somehow interact with all these old and sick people; the extreme awkwardness is one thing, but another thing is that you know that their physical suffering is definitely not going to be reduced by simply having volunteers there and it just makes you feel so helpless. Then there's the kind of volunteering that is just saikang, like cleaning stuff and house painting. For house painting, I had a personal experience where the person whose house we were painting clearly wanted us to stop and kept telling us nicely that the painting looks ok and we have painted enough. It clearly feels like we are just wrecking her house and looking at our slipshod paint job (cos we aren't professional painters after all) only emphasises this feeling.

278,"To be honest, it feels like I have come so far till the point now in NUS. Meaning I just feel like I am not as ""pure"" as before, and I have the tendency of wanting people to change perceptions of me.

Just a background of myself. I used to study overseas during my nursery and kindergarten, where English was not my first language. Only since primary school, I have always been studying in Singapore. As I was mostly home during those periods where my parents were working day in day out, I had never really socialise with other children. I did not even know how to communicate with them and not even knowing how to make friends. 

This got worse in primary school where i suffered bullying for about 3 years, where i had the naive thinking that if I was nice to anybody regardless bullies or not, they will appreciate me one day. But no, this never happened and school had been hell for me. They even criticised my looks and me being ""weird"". My mum found out one day that i was bullied and told me to be harsh if need be. I totally changed my attitude towards people, changed my looks by dressing more appropriately and etc and even focusing on building close connections. Of course in between I had experienced some ups and downs during my connection with people, such as betrayals and even those with toxic mentality. 

Thus I feel like I have changed in terms of how i interact with people. This is good for me personally as I have more people to communicate with and etc. But what I have noticed is, based on my past experience of making such connections, I just cannot help but have the tendency to always change myself(such as looks, personality and etc) as compared to how people usually view me. For example my secondary school friend had the thinking initially that I was always very quiet, not dressing up. But now in the same uni, she saw me and commented that I look and act totally different of how she viewed me initially. Even towards the bullies in the past, I kept making sure I look better and do much better than them even though i tried my best not to bother about them. However after meeting them, I then focus on how to make myself even better than before and change their perceptions for the better. In short, I seem to bother more about people's opinions and impressions of me, when I am trying my best to love myself by just being myself. Instead it feels quite pressurising at times having these tendencies. Sighs...

Here's my experience of a semester in the UK. I paid for it fully from my own savings so for students who are worried about money, don't.

1. NUS bursary is a lifesaver. They gave me 4K. That paid for my  flights to and from and my accomodation.
2. I spent about 2K on flight. Not sure of the exact amount.
3. Don't be a scared Singaporean and stay in campus halls. It's expensive. I paid $240/month for a private share house and walked 20mins to uni. The Singaporean who stayed on campus paid $500 and got a smaller space and stayed with intl students but I stayed with 2 locals students.
4. I made my own lunch and dinner and only ate out on weekends. Don't be paiseh to cook. The local students I stayed with, they themselves said food is expensive and cooked lunch and dinner.
5. Any shopping, sightseeing, trains within UK was from my own savings. There are student discounts for almost everything.
6. Don't need to travel the entire Europe just because youre in the UK. Take your semester to immerse fully and enjoy the British life. London isn't the only place to visit.
7. Unless you've lots of money, choose to do exchange outside of London. London is at least twice of other cities for everything.

284,"TLDR: should I be accepting a persistent guy whose looks I'm not attracted to, but his care and concern is what touched me? but important thing to bear in mind is that I have rejected him before. but he somehow touched me overtime, and he kept persisting.

Here's a super long story (I warned, I posted TLDR right at the start). Just a little background story. I'm a girl, evergreen, never been in a r/s, and this story consist of two guys. And all these interaction with them are of online context. Before you groan and do the ""omg get out there"" stuff, I do get out there, but like most other stories had recurred, it's not as easy as you think. It's hard for us working adults, and I'm shy on top of being an introvert as well.

Guy A is someone I know through an online game. He's smart, witty, and charismatic. You must be wondering how I conclude that. Former two being his replies to others, even when people try to put him down his response are always calm and above them, with a tinge of sarcasm that immediately put the hostile opponent down. Charismatic, he's a leader in our game and people look up to him. One thing about him though, because he has so much to handle, he typically showed no interest to most people.

I liked A but here's the bomb, A is married. So I have never expressed anything out of the slightest. I invested alot, though. I can drop my schedules if he need me; Even if I'm tired I made myself do it cos he need it; I send him bday packages (overseas yea) for two years now. Oversea gifts are expensive due to postage/shipping but I do it anyway. Love is blind, or so I thought it was. I can't even exactly pinpoint why I liked him. I guess I liked someone who is kinda ""cold"". Makes me have the protective instinct and feel that everyone have a good in them that will show when showed warmth.

I started a new game with A and that's where we know B from. B is pretty high flier in it, everyone is in awe of him. B knew me through A, and had joked asking if I wanted to join his ""harem"", I said no flat out since I still like A. However, from then, B made it a mission to win me over. He had told me after that he had never been rejected before and it stings, he want to revenge by making fall for him. Despite our whole guild including him know I tend towards A because I always showed I like A in banters and all. So I had never treated B serious, cos I dislike being played and I felt he wasn't serious about, it was just an ""achievement"" thing for him.

I subsequently rejected him a few more times when he asked (staggered of course, not at once). Oh, and this game has marriage, whenever he ask me I reject, he marry one, but they never last long lol. Because he marry them in name but was never with them, he's always hanging around me. The funny thing is, this ""mission"" of his never cease even after more than 6 months. And eventually he confessed that he like me and maybe beyond. And it happened only after awhile, since initially it wasn't so. 

Something I failed to mention, is that A personality got more and more worse overtime. I mean, I knew he was this way, but since I liked him I always made excuse for his behaviour and allow him to degrade me. But the existence of B made me realize how badly I was treated (and I had continue to allow it after all this while). B was always there for me, interested to know my thoughts, my feelings (and that's what matters to me), and never degrades me the way A does. A is what you call a typical narcissist. When he was in fault he will twist it to my fault, it's never his fault. I usually just say sorry and accept it. He never says sorry. 

B often ask why I allow A to be such a d!ck to myself. Because it's apparent in the way A talk to me, and I often laugh it off or bicker back, which everyone see it as playful banter. Sometimes it is, but really, I felt terribly sad sometimes. I began to talk more to B rather than A, and I love the way I am treated as someone important, or at least, a human being. But that's the thing, I like the way I was treated, but I wasn't attracted to his looks (I know how he looks like but he doesn't know how I look like yet). He, however, always constantly tell me he like/love me. So I was conflicted whether to bring it further. I didn't want to short-change him or anything, like whether do I really like him or it's just his care and concern that I like.

This post is too long in fact, I can go on and on about it since I kept this bottled up, my friends dk about this. Sorry for this long post. I actually deliberated for 2 weeks whether I want advice from others, and that it's too complicated to type out in details, but decide to in the end, since I would be meeting him in less than a month time for the first time, and it's pretty nerves-wrecking. I'm not sure anyone has ever been in such situation, anyone can relate? Or anyone with more past experiences/interactions, would appreciate some advice if possible :( 

TLDR: should I be accepting a persistent guy whose looks I'm not attracted to, but his care and concern is what touched me? but important thing to bear in mind is that I have rejected him before. but he somehow touched me overtime, and he kept persisting.

I feel that my life has been pretty empty without a person to share my life with. Friends in the past whom you can share so much laughter and fun with, come and go. My life now is summed up as going to work, coming back for dinner and slacking in front my PC or tv. The cycle rinses and repeats, save for the occasional meetup with a handful of friends. I just want to ask for those who have been evergreen for a long time and got attached, does getting attached enrich your life a lot? Would having a partner put laughter and memorable experiences in your lives? I long so much for that now that I feel pretty much like a drone without a soul.

So basically last Saturday I went to confront one of the “guy friends” of hers which I assume he likes her. 
I’m unsure how to explain this but when u saw a guy you can just tell that he actually likes your girl as a friend or with motives just by the way he looks at her. You just can tell. (Victim herself probably couldn’t and keep coming up with lies and well idk or she just love the attention of guys.)

Anyway I confronted him despite my girlfriend previously keeps claiming they just “friends” and he have no motives. Guess what? I was right he told me in the face that he likes my girlfriend and his willing to break his current gf to be with her. YEAH break his “current gf” to be with “my gf.” I almost punch the guy in the face seriously cannot take this anymore.. but fine at least I have an answer now that I was right all the way.

Anw Sunday I manage to get my gf out for HTHT again but face to face this time round instead of calls or messages. And I told her all this so basically she was shocked as she doesn’t believe me because she think boy girl friendship exist. (Totally fine they do, just rarely or I think so)

Anyway after telling her all this she somehow still doubt me and think that I'm making it up.
So yeah I did what guys should do instead of continuing be in this pain I broke up with her. (Really wish I recorded the freaking convo to confront her making her speechless)

Well at least now i no longer have to suffer this pain of neglecting, under prioritised  and heartache.

293,"There are many people talking about how they don't have close friends in life, about how hard it is to make friends in uni. Many people have said that it is part of adult life that friends come and go and they just have to get used to it. I disagree. 

My grandmother passed away recently, and at her wake many of her friends whom she knew for decades came forward and shared how they were thankful for all that my grandmother did for them. They recounted how she went to care for them after they had surgery, how she said encouraging words to them at their lowest point when people were criticising them, and how much they would miss the joy she brought to others. My grandmother is my role model in what it means to love my friends. 

So when a friend in school told me she changed friends whenever she entered a new phase of life because it's part of ""adulting"", I was alarmed, because I feel that is degrading the precious value of friendship. Nowadays a girl and a guy can meet in uni and then when one of them confesses after less than a month the other says, ""Sigh, you mean alot to me, and I really wanted to keep this friendship."" In my mind I'm thinking, what friendship? They barely know each other...? 

Friendship goes beyond companionship, it is a tried and tested bond that stands the tests of time and circumstance. I myself am lucky to have close friends that I have known for over 10 years. I know they will be in my life for a long time because my friendship with them is not seasonal. Sometimes I really hate my friends for the things they do or the hurt they cause me. But I realised that friendship works like this: I like my friends for some of their characteristics, but I love them despite some of their characteristics. They are in my life because both sides invest in the friendship, and continuously care, love and forgive. 

So to all those out there who feel empty because they don't have a friend that stays, don't let others tell you that it's reality. To experience friendship that lasts a lifetime is possible and beautiful. Keep trying because from my grandmother's life I know it is possible :)

Admittedly, I've been rather fortunate over the past two and a half years when it comes to my results in NUS.

However, from the results that were just released this morning, I got an A- for one of my level 1000 UE modules.

I am faced with this dilemma - should I use my SU so that I can maintain my CAP at 5.0 and not let my CAP drop to 4.9? However doing so would leave a S grade in my transcript that is really ugly. 

Alternatively, I could keep my A- grade, but that would cause my CAP to drop to 4.9 which is equally ugly on my transcript.

301,"Dear NUS students,

I am so happy that I discovered this NUSWhispers Facebook page. During my times at NUS 7 years ago, the page was called “NUS Confessions” (I remember that when it was created, it caused some controversy in conservative and prudish Singapore), and I was curious why the page had become inactive. I am glad to see that the NUS Confessions page has continued by becoming NUSWhispers.

I was an exchange student from Europe (I don’t want to give too many details about my country, as some people might recognise me) at NUS during the 2012/2013 academic year, and reading through the confessions makes me so nostalgic about my year abroad there. I wanted to share with you that this year has been unforgettable for me, probably the best in my life so far. I met some people who became my best friends, and met my first love there. Although we are not together anymore (thank you long distance relationship), we are still close friends and I still cherish today the memories of our times together.

I visited Singapore recently for the first time since I left in 2013, and it was such a pleasure for me to go back to the places where I had so many good memories : I saw that U-Town is now fully completed (and what an amazing place it is for students !). I also went back to the Foodclique food court at U-Town, where I had an Indian meal, which was my favourite. 

This meal was like a Proust Madeleine for me ; so many more forgotten memories came back to my mind as I closed my eyes and ate the fluffy and crispy roti prata and tasted the spices and textures of the briyani rice and flavourful curry and vegetables. Later on, I went back to the U-Town swimming pool (my old NUS card still worked, I didn’t expect that !), and watched with delight the sun set over the graduate residence towers and people chilling and playing together on the U-Town green, reminiscing myself with nostalgia that I was one of these people I was watching 7 years ago. I also took advantage of my stay in Singapore to walk and explore the hidden gems of the city.

Singapore truly feels like a second home to me, and it will forever be associated with the great memories of my youth years. I just wanted to share these memories with you via this post, and tell you that your country will always have a special place in my heart.

Sending you lots of love,

I PM-ed quite a few that commented but received no response. Could it be that my message went into the junk/spam folder since we aren’t friends? 

Anyway, i’ll try another approach. If you had offered me any sort of advice, please give me the opportunity to thank you. Post your bank account number in the comments and i’ll transfer a couple of thousand to you via internet banking.

310,"Regards to #75209 Geomancy /fortune reading. 
I dabble in fortune reading myself but not the kind that plan out your life. But good with reading people and providing a near future predictions. 
If I see a person and I don’t like the person, it’ll be because the person has bad qualities. I mean it when I tell someone they will have problems if they stay with this person etc. Or not happy with them etc.
I always mean well and hope for the best for my clients who come to me for readings. 
But ultimately, even if I give my best advice for my clients, if they choose to go against what I’ve told them, I can only watch in silence. 
We cannot influence what the client choose ultimately and can only hope the client will learn and do better next time. 
I’m not sure if your teller is well meaning but that’s how I do it. Most fortune tellers also believe in karma as well. 

So my advice, is to listen to your heart and make a decision that’s the best for you. Even if you end up making a bad decision, there’s a lesson that the universe has planned for you to learn. So choose, don’t let other people make the decision for you, and then learn if you fall.

311,"To #74228 and students  wondering if it’ll get better, it will. Just wanted to share my story:

I’m a Yr4 Accounting senior and my first sem in biz was dismal. 2B+and 2C+, by calculation it’s a third class. Spent the next few days in shock.

The subsequent compulsory accounting mods against very smart, driven students (most of which have been in elite schools their whole lives) saw about the same results. These peeps scored at least 5-6 distinctions in A levels at that time so the competition was really tough.

Managed to pull to a second lower by end of Y2 but always felt inadequate- never knew anyone below Cap4 (either that or some people were lying) but gradually as I cleared my compulsory mods and explored modules outside my faculty and more towards my interest like languages and philo, I found myself putting much less effort for much better grades. Consistently got 2-3As which pulled my Y3S2 Cap to a 3.9.

With FYP this sem was just nice CAP4.0. When I received my SMS (usually I can’t sleep the day before) I literally cried

Basically, it’s entirely possible for someone to jump 2 classes with the right determination, right module choices with just the right friends and company to push you to succeed. 

Don’t fret about your results, you can definitely improve, merry Christmas everyone!

TLDR: Try to fix first but please leave if it doesn't work out.

I agree that the past generation tend to stay in relationships longer and the rate of divorce these days is definitely higher in comparison. But keep in mind that people might stay in relationships for different reasons back then. For eg, I've a few uncles who are substance abusers (alcohol, smoking, you name it) and honestly the wives are only staying because they are housewives and will lose all they have if they leave. So yes couples stay with each other longer but are they really happy? This is probably a question that only they can answer. 

What's the point of writing this? The point is that I'm seeing way too many instances whereby couples stay in relationships because of fb/ig posts about how you should ""never stop trying"" and ""stick through it all because your partner is worth more than that"". Broken relationships end up dragging for months and even years before the eventual break and by then both parties are worn out and there's no longer any affection left - only resentment. So then when outsiders lament that ""it's a pity that such a long-term relationship ended just like that"" the fact is that it has ended a long time ago. Of course there are those who on the other hand give up too easily but we need to realise that both groups are equally problematic.  

Like you said, we are all work in progress and sometimes we really are oblivious to the pain that we are causing to our partners. To this, I raise having better communication and healthy arguments instead of the focus on fixing. The obsession with fixing hints that everything can indeed be mended which is untrue because sometimes, you really can't fix what's already broken.

315,"Hello viewers of NUSWhispers. 
If you recall I wrote a post about how getting stared at is rude and people seemed to think that staring at is socially acceptable. (people thought I was wrong for being upset) 

Today this incident happened at Clementi Mall. An aunty “tsk” at a teenage boy and he got upset (entitled aunty who obviously don’t know how to respect people) The boy hurled vulgarities and got slapped by the aunty’s daughter, and the boy of course was gonna fight back. The boy definitely wasn’t wrong, he didn’t start it and didn’t deserve to get slapped by the daughter for HER MOTHERS actions 

This is EXACTLY why I said Singaporean’s need to use their brains and learn what being socially aware means. A lot of Singaporean’s have no Social Awareness and a lot of these Aunties think they’re damn entitled because they “built Singapore” 

Lampah backside lah. Learn to respect people. Don’t stare at people and don’t tsk at people. 
One day someone who is uneducated and doesn’t know what being socially aware means, would get beat up for either staring // tsking at another person. 

Please learn to respect others, and if you got nothing good to say, don’t say.

For some reason that I cannot recall, I know that it never snows in Singapore. Instead, you get the occasional hailstorms. Do you Singaporeans carry special umbrellas for this? For example umbrellas made of kevlar which are so strong that  it can withstand the force of the hailstorm. How cold can it get in winter in Singapore? (I’d really appreciate if you can give me the temperature in fahrenheit)

I heard from some of my friends that Singapore is somewhat related to China in some way. Is swimming from Singapore to China a popular activity and if so which beach is popular for that? Is changi beach one of them? It appears to me from Google Maps that Changi beach is relatively closer to China that other beaches in Singapore. Roughly how far do I have to swim? (Again, a distance in feet is much appreciated :)

Last question:  I heard that you guys speak Singlish in Singapore instead of English.  You see, every time I go to a foreign country which speaks a foreign language, I always use Google translate. Makes my life so much easier with Google doing the translation. However, I am unable to find a language called Singlish on Google translate.  Can anyone help me with that?  Thanks mann in advance!

I am a Swedish guy currently on exchange at NUS, and I would like to share with you a bad experience that I had at one of the hawker centres on campus soon after I arrived, as I would like to know what Singaporean would think about it.

I am quite a friendly guy, and I make a lot of small talks with strangers. I want to know where the guy seated next to me at a restaurant comes from and for example for fellow students, what his course is. 

Due to the lunch crowd, I had to share seats with a young guy whom I assume is a local student. He was hard at work, probably rushing to submit his math assignment. As a math major, I saw this opportunity to help out and also make some friends.

So I ask him ""do you have a problem?""
And he seemed really angry after I asked him the question, and started scolding me in Singlish, and unfortunately (or fortunately maybe) I couldn't understand what he was saying, but I interpreted it as ""what genital are you looking at, if you are not happy let's box it out'. I want to make clear that I asked the question very politely and in a friendly way, and that I didn't intend to hurt him in any way.

I don't understand his reaction, and I wanted to know if from a Singaporean point of view my question is seen as rude. In Sweden, we make small talk everywhere and offering help is not seen as rude at all. Could it be that he thought I was insulting his ability to solve math questions?

323,"hi, had to get this off my chest. I have been attached for 4 years in uni and i love my girlfriend dearly. As my girlfriend is quite sensitive, i have actively avoided interacting closely with any girls for the past 3 years. Add this with my 2 years of NS and its been 6 years since I actually talk or interact properly with any girls. 

Recently, I met a girl friend of mine one-on-one to pass her some lights that she told me she needed for Christmas. I offered to travel to her place since I was free that day. When I reached her place, she had made lunch for me and invited me to chill around. I found the gesture really sweet and at that moment, for the first time, I thought she looked really cute and sweet (I have no idea why I never noticed this despite knowing her for 7 years already). 

we had lunch and ice cream for desert (it was sorbet and i wasn't really a fan) and then we just sat on her sofa and chit chatted for around an hour. 
sorry to disappoint any readers but no we didn't do anything, but ever since that day which was around a week ago, I keep thinking about her even though I've been trying to block it out. 

I can't tell if this counts as cheating and if its because because I am very inexperienced with girls and fell into infatuation easily but I've been feeling really guilty to my girlfriend and trying to spend more time with her since its the holidays now as well. 

I've always despised cheaters but now i'm really afraid i am emotionally cheating, although I haven't texted the other girl since then. Does this count as emotional cheating? What do you guys advice I do?

Thus far, our convo is centred mostly on our daily lives and some random stuff, which is ok. But recently, I realized that the convo is focusing more on me only (as in he would ask me about stuff and I would answer, and this goes on and on).

He admitted that he is an introvert and a very slow texter (takes many hours to reply) - which I'm completely fine with and I choose to believe his words.

But I'm just wondering if he is at least a little interested in me (hence he still keeps the convo going even with the not-so-active/delayed responses), or am I like just a side option to him (maybe as a chat buddy)? Thus far, I have a relatively positive impression of him, and it seems like he is quite honest and upright (general impression I get through texts). Do you guys see a future in this relationship? Or is it still too early to tell? If yes, what should I do to continue this? If not, then maybe I should just stop the conversation once and for all.

I've always had a general impression that ppl on dating sites show their preferences quite quickly (like they will stop the convo if they are not interested), but this is something different so I'm unsure what to do.

He appears to hide things really well.. Never seen him openly messaging on  whatsapp. There is a few occasions when he on his phone, its showing a text which a girl has sent.. It was too fasr for me to catch futher glimpse of the message.

He don't seem like the sort (studious kind of guy) whom will play with girls or am I underestimating his ability?

Sometimes he plans dates on the day itself. If he wants to genuinely ask me out, he would have plan a day before at the very least? Or it is normal? 

He always avoids answering directly to my questions as well...

Managed to get a full time office job and I have been loving my job ever since. There is one problem, there is no malay in the office. All my colleagues are either foreigners, chinese or indians. 

I feel lonely sometimes because I can't relate much with other colleagues. I eat lunch alone most of the time due to my halal restriction. Due to all of this, I don't really socialise much in the office or hang out with colleagues. How do I deal with this?

for the past 1 year though, i am repulsive towards physical intimacy (even kissing, or pecking on the lip). it just feels weird kissing him, let alone touching intimately. 

any reason there could be for feeling this way? just to clarify, we are both virgins still, saving it till after marriage. please do not advise on trying out sex to increase intimacy.

353,"This is my plea for help. To give some context, im a 20 year old  guy with an unusually high pitched voice which has really made me insecure from the stares i get, especially from my laughter. 
My skin tone is unusually yellow even by asian standards and my skin is so porous it’s visible and this is not even me being critically biased towards myself, many of my peers have told me so. To put the cherry on top, people have also commented on how squarish and oblong my head shape is.

I don’t really have anybody i can turn to as well. I was abandoned by my parents before i was born, my best and only friend can be a little daft and lives under a rock so I can’t really blame him for not being a shoulder to lean on. I work part time at F&B restaurant earning peanuts with a stingy boss that is never granting me time off or OT pay such that i can only afford 1 pair of shoes and working clothes. Even my neighbour is some grumpy loner that gives me dirty stares every time we see each other. Safe to say that nobody in this world really cares about me. Maybe i should just end it all in my pineapple house under the sea.

He used to frequent the casino but less now that he's with me and I only just turned 21. I asked him on my 21st birthday whether he could bring me to the casino and i wanted to go so badly but he said no bc it was too expensive for me to enter. However, his malaysian friend (a girl) recently turned 21 too and that night, he went with her and 2 other friends to the casino and he lost $300 there - all this while we were on a fight and he only texted me afterwards to apologise for fighting w me. I just wanted to ask if this is normal for him not to want to pay $150 for me even though he knows i really wanted to go? I'm not upset that he doesn't want to pay for me, but more about the fact that he knew i wanted to go so badly but didn't bring me bc of the price AND went with some other girl who wanted to go but didn't have to pay emtrance fee.

360,"I really envy other girls who receive flowers. I am average looking with some bitch resting face, and have dated before. I already in my late twenties but the only times I receive flowers was when my boss asked the admin to send me a large set of flowers to my grandpa’s funeral and when I performed on stage in secondary school. In my last serious relationship, I hinted to my bf that I wanted flowers but during one karaoke session a few weeks before we broke up, he even had the cheek to sing “When I was your man” into my face. (Think the first line of the chorus). 

I wanted flowers so much that sometimes I think, whoever is the first guy who gives me even one stalk of flower for romantic reasons, I will secretly decide to marry him if he wants to marry me in the future and if he’s not a jerk. I know it’s silly, but that’s how much it somehow irrationally meant to me. I confided about this to a friend and she asked why flowers, why not chocolate why not anything else. I think, it’s probably the meaning of the validation that comes with it - that flowers are pretty, that if someone is willing to spend the money to buy something expensive that last only a few days, you must be worth it in his eyes. I mean, after working, I have the financial ability to buy myself a whole room of flowers if that’s all I want. I also can ask directly for flowers in my next relationship, but it’s just not the same. 

Well, I guess I am really literally 花痴, haha.

366,"In light of the recent passing of K-pop stars Sulli and Goo Hara, I am reminded of the time when I was still in JC, and I felt like giving up my life. It is that sudden spur of the moment, when you feel as though ""you don't deserve to be treated that way"".

I had taken on a leadership position in my school's choir, which required me to lead an acapella ensemble in the national anthem from time to time. The intense choir practice schedules left me with a damaged vocal chord, so I started asking other leaders to assume the role of leading the acapella choir instead. Despite explaining to others about my current vocal condition, they were quick to criticize that I had instead tried to push responsibilities away. Over time, I fell into depression and once broke down in front of the choir. One of the members took my situation onto social media and mocked me for that. I nearly ended my life that day.

Looking back now, I wished I did not take other's opinions of me to heart, but I was merely 17 years old and did not know how to process such a situation. I wish people could be kinder and more supportive, and not make nasty comments and assumptions about things that they do not understand.

The Silent Generation thinks that their boomer children can be disrespectful and entitled too. My mum often talks back rudely to my granddad while inculcating in me the values of respecting your elders since young. I mean, if both your predecessor and successor generations have issues with your generation it means its just your generation and there's really something wrong with it, isn't it?

Made this post after my dad commented that we young people are weak and can never understand the hardship that made boomers tough. My granduncle then savagely dismissed his comment with an ""OK Boomer, what hardship?"" and then proceeded to talk about his childhood experiences of surviving the Japanese occupation, while questioning if the comfortable and peaceful times that my dad went through could even be considered as hard as compared to hiding in canals and living on sweet potatoes.

I'm a loner too, and somewhat socially awkward. Although according to my peers/people I meet it's the cute/funny kinda of awkward so I don't really know what to make of that. 

Personally, I don't have issues talking to people. When I want to, I can converse no problem, but most of the time I choose not to socialise. And for me there's a simple reason behind it

Everyone has a limited amount of attention to give, or in my own words: ""forks"" to give (I'm substituting the original word to make it more family friendly). Everyone is born with a different number of them, and everyone chooses to distribute them differently. Assuming someone has 20 forks, her/she may choose to give 10 people 1 fork each, and 2 people 5 forks each. Another person might only have 10 forks, and chooses to give 5 to one person, and keep 5 for himself/herself. 

Some people (like me) are the second type. We have no problem socialising when we need/want to, but we choose not to, because we want to save our limited time and attention for those who really matter. Not saying that it's bad to distribute your forks too widely, it's just how everyone chose to live their lives. Also not saying that every loner is the second type of person. Some might genuinely have issues giving out their forks even if they want or need to. 

Hope this helps people understand what loners (at least some of us) are thinking.

374,"Dear Prof Ben and NUSWhispers community,

TLDR; Girl I like seemed to like me back during school term. Ghosted me during vacation. I don't think she's the kind that would use me but who knows. I want to continue whatever we had. Might be awkward if I want but she doesn't. I'm lost... How should I treat her or go about this tactfully? Even just as friends? 

There's this girl that I really like and have been helping her for homework during the semester. We were very close. She was not rejecting my romantic advances, and sometimes even reciprocating. It seemed mutual. I thought we had a thing but it turns out she just completely ghosted me during the vacation. 

We were so close during the semester. I don't understand why she ghosted me. But maybe something happened or maybe she's just not in the mood? To be fair it could have been something I did that made her decide I don't want this guy. Looking back I realise I haven't really showed her feel loved in the way she wanted despite her hints. Maybe I should be understanding and give her the benefit of doubt. She seemed very genuine during the semester. Not like the kind of girl with a motive. 

But right now when I try to talk to her she'll seem cold and uninterested. We used to talk every day. Now she's not initiating convos and when I do, she'll give me one word replies. She seems like she doesn't want this anymore.

Sometimes it makes me feel like I'm just being annoying and I trying to talk to her is just pestering her. It feels stupid trying to talk to her when she doesn't want to talk. I don't know what happened or if it's something I did wrong. 

There'll prob be a lot of comments telling me to 'ditch her, u just got used' and everything but please don't. 

I still want this relationship (or friendship) and I treasure her as a person. I like her a lot. and there's the possibility that she's just going through something. I just don't want to assume that this is over cause it might not be. 

Right now, I don't know how to continue this 'relationship'. It's hard to continue when the other person is making it feel 'one-way' even tho it used not be. And it's hard to let her know how I feel or ask her directly since we are not exactly boyfriend girlfriend. I just hope that this is a misunderstanding and it'll all work out eventually. What should I do? How should I continue treating her? How do I get things to be like the way it used to

So my gf and I have been dating for 2 months and i am continuously surprised at how horny she is. 1 week into our relationship, she started to stroke my groin area whenever we are on the bus and it turns me on easily .

I was taken aback at her suggestion at first and thought that she was just joking. In the end ,we just did it.Her Best Friend is pretty hot and has nice perky boobs.she seems to be excited to join us and would often make out naked with my gf in front of me. 

This has been going on for a couple of occasions and I really do not know if we should stop having a threesome. It’s quite tiring to have sex with 2 girls at the same time .

I also really like the various baos, such as Char Siew Bao, Liu Sha Bao etc. Same goes for Nasi Lemak, especially those that are wrapped in the traditional pandan leaves. I will really miss these foods when I go back to my home country Japan in two months time.

However, I always end up getting a tummy ache after eating these three types of my favorite foods. I don’t understand how your Singaporean stomachs can stomach these few things after swallowing these ingredients from each of these three meals: the shell of the prawn tail in prawn noodles, the paper stuck at the bottom of the steamed char skew baos and liu sha boas, and lastly, the pandan leaves used to wrap the nasi lemak.

To me, the prawn tail shells, paper at the bottom of the steamed baos, and pandas leaves all taste exotic to me. I respect this is your culture, and that’s why I try to go with the flow and try my best to enjoy the taste of these three things.

So this guy I met from dating app just held my hands while we were walking, and he didn’t say anything about asking me to me his Girlfriend. 

We had met up for dates for two months and there were good vibes between us. He mentioned previously he would like to bring the relationship as far as he could. 

My question is are we together now that he held my hands? I’m not sure how to ask him about our status and his commitment. From our last conversations, I inferred that he was looking for a serious relationship (so I don’t think think it’s a fling) and our values (like family and honesty) seemed to align. Yet, I would like to be sure by hearing it from him. I would like to ask him but I don’t want to give the impression that I’m pushing for a status. 

What does it mean when’s a guy holds your hands? He is pretty introverted and can be a man of few words, and never had a relationship before.

At the same time, I’m happy and trying to be content with how the relationship is progressing now. Perhaps I should just wait? Thank you for your advice!

In my semester so far, I've realised that the locals here aren't as sexually open as the culture I've been used to back home. It seems like talking about sex is kind of taboo, I freely talk about it with fellow exchange students but I've grown afraid of even discussing such topics with locals (especially girls) who seem disgusted at the mere mentioning of it.

Is it something to do with the local culture? Is sex seen as a taboo here? I grew up with the mindset that sex is a very normal human thing to do, I mean isn't it something everyone enjoys with our genetic disposition. The age of consent in my country is 15 and people start doing it from a young age, I am very surprised to experience a culture where people who are around 20 and in university are still afraid to discuss these topics.

We've been broken up for a few month but I feel like I didnt get any closure even though i was the one who initiated the break up. 

You live right in the prime district of singapore and I live an hour away from you. Your family is obviously well to do whereas mine live in a 3 room flat. When we got together after a few months you visited my place and called it gross. Obviously I felt sad and inferior, but I brushed it off because I thought to myself, yes it's gross compared to yours. So I'm always the one who goes over to your place, staying over the weekend etc. You always wanted me to stay over friday through monday. I felt suffocated after the honeymoon period and asked that I have Sunday to myself, you got angry. Throughout the 3 years of the relationship you've only visited my place less than 5 times. When I told you sometimes it's tiring travelling from home to school and all, maybe you could come over instead, you straight out tell me no and if I feel unfair, I dont have to go over to your place anymore. It sounded like you were threatening to break up. So I sucked it up. 

We both have dogs, yours is a pure breed with some sort of certification whereas mine is a mongrel that I adopted. Whenever you walk your dog, if there's someone walking a mongrel you will say things like ""eww. Better not come near my dog"". Your parents once commented during a family dinner at home that ""stray dogs should just be shot dead in the streets"". You all laughed it off and I got so angry with that comment that I had to leave the table and cut the dinner short. When I told you how I felt you just said ""so?"". Is it an elitist thing? That only pure breed dogs like yours deserve to live? 

You are extremely calculative. When we would go out to dinner, you split the bill down to every cent. When I dont have enough cash, you would remind me ""hey don't forget you still owe me $1.20"". Not that I'm gold digging but you constantly reminding me makes me feel like I'm trying to cheat your money which I'm not. Sometimes when we over order and I really cannot eat anymore, you will say things like ""eh this dish very expensive, you better finish it"". Which honestly made me very uncomfortable. 

You are spoilt, rude and selfish. My parents aren't rich but they do the best they can for me. Sure, I had to work part time and take out a student loan for my education just like most singaporeans. You told me my parents shouldn't even have kids if they cannot afford basic things like education. That hurt. When expensive things break down in the house such as tv/refrigerator, I will fork out some money to lighten the load for my parents. You got angry and told me I shouldn't have done that, it is not my responsibility and I should save the money instead. 

You constantly find things to fight about. You dont let me hang out with my friends just because they have a different political view. You criticise the people and things I care about. When you found out sometimes I donate money to SPCA or SOSD (small amounts), you scolded me. Said we use the money to travel better.

We are completely different and I know the break up was the right decision. 

I guess this post was my very indirect way of spilling everything out to you and to air my grievances.

What do I do if I suddenly receive a six-figure sum of money? I received the money as an inheritance after a closed one passed away. 

The thing is, I have no idea about investments or who to approach for this kind of advice. I haven't asked anyone in person because I don't want anyone to know I have a lot of money.

I was thinking of putting them into endowment plans like the ones offered by insurance companies and just let it compound. 

But I wonder if there are better alternatives out there. What is the best way to invest a huge sum of money? How do I go about planning for my financial future? What are the factors which I should consider?

Never have I seen people so scared of their employers, willing to be mistreated or employers so happy to low ball younger graduates and derive sadistic pleasure from it. HR is one of the worst where they dont seem to have any sense of the harshness and emptiness of their behaviour. My advice to younger graduates would be to move out of singapore if you can, to better labour markets like Europe where they respect you as a person and employers dont have too much power. Guys, if you want to be in the club of rich nations, you better start acting like one. Having just nice buildings doesnt help.

399,"I'm not sure if I should break up with my boyfriend of 7 years. We were together since we were in Secondary 3. You would just look at me and smile at me in class!!! Urghhhh. Sometimes, we would even eat lunch together, or hang out and chill at Lot 1 after school. Even though we were in different CCAs, we still managed to spend time with each other. We hid our relationship from our parents cause we knew they were against our relationship. Only our schoolmates and probably teachers knew about us and everyone thought that we were so cute together. They even thought that our relationship would last.

Then came JC. Both of us agreed to enter the same JC and went on to SAJC together. We took different combinations and only had same lecture and tutorials for Maths, Chemistry and Physics.  Still remember the time you bought me an exam welfare pack before A levels to wish me all the best! That's super cute and I super adore you. We had more arguments than usual especially in JC, but I don't blame you since both of us are feeling the pressure to do well in JC and go to a good school together in NUS. Eventually we managed to get through it and graduate from SAJC together. 

You got a higher score than me for A levels and you went to Business and Accountancy while I settled for Mechanical engineering. Due to the difference in courses, we spent less time together as our timetables clashed and it's not feasible to just walk to each other's school just to meet up for lunch. You usually spend your time with your clique instead of meeting me to go home together. How I wish both of us were staying on campus so that we can meet up more often. It's like things changed ever since we entered university. You claimed that you were busy on weekends trying to finish up your tutorials and understanding the lecture but half the time your Instagram stories show that you are outside with your clique! Because of this we started arguing and we started to talk less. 

We haven't talked for about a week and I'm not sure what to do. Should I message him first and talk to him and clear the doubts, and try to be understanding towards him? I mean it's the holidays, we all know that there is no work to do during the holidays but he hasn't been talking to me much ever since the end of the examinations.

But anyway, it's the end of Year 1 Sem 1 for both of us. Results are coming out real soon and I hope that you read this message and score really well, as it's your dream to get a GPA of at least 4.5!!

Hope things will go back to the things they were, especially the times when we were in NS where we usually meet up on the weekends to talk and chill :)

400,"So i'm a guy and I have been in a relationship with this girl for almost 2.5 years. Recently I've noticed that she has been getting very abusive with me physically and emotionally. She suspects that I am in a relationship with another girl when in reality there is none going on or gets frustrated with me for some random reason that she comes up with. Few weeks ago we were hanging out in town and I was on my phone, she suddenly decides to pull the phone out of my hand and throw it directly at my face(which hit my jaw quite hard by the way). When I questioned her about it she just walked away without saying anything. She is reluctant to have a conversation with me and have even let her search through my phone to let her see that I am not cheating on her. However she still does not seem convinced. She has also been giving me random slaps and punches for no reason while I am over at her place(she does not live with her family), and I have stopped meeting her in private areas because of this for the past few months. But she seems to be doing this in public spaces as well in a less obvious manner. It never used to be like this during the first year of our dating and getting to know each other in uni. It was a really memorable and great time that we shared in the past. We have both graduated and are in pretty decent jobs with some financial stability. Is this some sort of mental illness that this sociopath can get help for or should I just break this damn nightmare of a relationship this is turning into? But I am also afraid to break this relationship off at this point because our social circle of friends have become very intertwined...basically my friends are also her friends vice versa... and she we also go to the same church almost every week which makes things even worst. Our friends have no clue what is going on and they assume that we are a happy couple. How do I break this off without damaging my current social circle of friends? Has any guy encountered similar situations like this before? Your insight can be really helpful...Mental illness is a serious problem these days ...

401,"I saw a post earlier on dealing with severe eczema and i want to share my story as well. I also had eczema since i was born. I am not sure why but as i get older my eczema got worser. My skin is super thin and red, and although i try my best not to scratch, it is super difficult to fight against the itch. As my skin is so fragile, simply scratching it for a few seconds will cause the skin to tear, bleed and weep(production of clear fluid). My entire body is filled with scratch wounds making it hard for me to even perform normal daily activities. I dread bathing everyday as the pain is unbearable. Imagine bathing with knife cuts all over your body. Also, when u wake up, imagine seeing your entire bed filled with skin and blood. Sometimes even walking is painful as the skin will be pulled on. Even though eczema is not directly life threatening compared to other more serious  illness but it really causes a lot of pain both physically and emotionally. We are insecure when we go out due to our skin. When the skin condition is super bad it is so painful and uncomfortable that we cannot even leave the house. Eczema is also triggered by the sun, heat, sweat, dust and stress so we cannot participate in any outdoor activities as well. Because of my severe eczema  i did not participate in any orientation activities and other activities so i do not really have friends in uni. Due to the bad skin condition it also hard for me to approach others and be friends without being judged. Also, the medication we have to take have harmful side effects as well which just takes a huge toll on our health. All in all, severe eczema is a really painful medical condition to suffer from. It is not just a case of having itchy skin which many who do not have the condition perceive. Sometimes i wonder will the pain end when i die?
 
My eczema flared recently due to stress from all the projects submissions and finals. This makes me realize that health is actually more important than studies. There is no point having good grades if our health is terrible. With poor health we cannot even go on with our normal activities much less work.  Though we are caught in a rat race it would be good if we all can slow down and appreciate the finer things in life like our own health and family. 

To those suffering from eczema or other severe illnesses lets hope everything will be better soon and press on! :)

404,"Would love to hear your opinions/ advice for this issue. I have been crushing on this guy hard since two years ago. We were from the same CCA in JC and we got pretty close (people assumed we were together). I felt that he liked me too back then, but probably didn't ask me out as it was a bad timing: A levels coming up, and he's going to be in the Army while I'm in uni. We still keep in touch and meet up a few times a year.

I've tried to move on, but even after meeting so many people in uni, he's still the only one I will consider as a bf. He is joining NUS next sem, and he said he'd join the same CCA as me again! The problem is that he doesn't seem that interested in me anymore. Recently he had been treating me as a senior, like he is more polite than he was before, and our conversations are mostly about uni life. I tried being friendlier but he sort of put up a ""junior/ senior barrier""? What is going on?? We're the same age so I really don't understand why he's being like that. We also meet up less often now, even though he has more free time. He's still single and has complained to me before about how hard it is to meet new people to find a potential gf. 

I don't want to confess out of the blue as that would probably put him on the spot, as he doesn't ""see me as a girl"" now. How do I let him at least consider me as an option? I've been dressing up nicely when we go out, we would sort of flirt over text but he thinks I'm joking and he'd flirt back jokingly as well. I know I'm quite deep in the friendzone here, but what can I do? I wouldn't mind confessing out of the blue, even risking our friendship. My crush on him is really draining, and has been preventing me from potentially finding a bf. I just wish to have a closure to this, and I want to give it a shot.

407,"Hi guys, I'm currently in a ldr; my girlfriend doing her preU studies in London, while I'm a y2 student from NUS. We have been together for 4 years and this ldr thing has begun in Sept 2019. Both of us has gotten used to it, researched lots of info to get us mentally prepared on this journey so we are still going strong.

The only problem lies our dog (we have adopted on our 1st anniversary). For the past 3 years, he lives with my girlfriend (I was in NS then - also a reason why we adopted the dog, so that she will not feel too lonely when I'm in camp), so both of them have a very close relationship, while I would drop by her house to spend time with them every weekends. But due to her studies, he is currently living with me and has been whining every night ever since. He is also not as active as before as he is always curled up at the corner of my room, and isolates himself from other dogs (my cousins brought their dogs over a couple of times and he didn't bother interacting with them). Although I have put them through facetime, he always avoids her. We have talked about this problem, but came to a conclusion that it's impossible for my her to fly back due to her curriculum - a 1 semester per year sort of thing, so she can only comeback around June. Hence, we are rather lost and are really sorry for bringing sadness into his life, despite promising to give him the opposite when we first adopted him. We don't know how to help him and it's rather saddening to see him like this. I have heard of therapies but does it actually work?

He made personal attacks, guilt trip me, spoke ill of my family and friends, always put the blame on me, and he made me doubt myself. All these are just some of the things that he did to me. After the breakup, he spammed me with calls and texts that were filled with insults. It took me months to heal myself and get rid of his toxicity. While I have moved on and became stronger, he still texts and calls me once in awhile, which I ignored. Whenever I tell my family about his texts, they will say ""wah he can't move on ah.

I love the fact that we share our look-outs because human tend to look at things that are pleasant to the eyes, while we can share this with our partner.

Sometimes, I attempt to catch my fart when it comes out, and hold that space of air and quickly place it near his nose so that he gets the full smelly impact.

I guess, we are two lucky souls who managed to find each other on the same weird wavelength. I can see how to other people, they would find our behaviour awfully weird though.

423,"Hi, 

Long post ahead. 

I just want to encourage all those who are struggling with your studies/work/finances/relationships/life in general to keep pushing on. 

I am in my final year and my NUS journey is nothing but 7 consecutive semesters of struggle, occasionally interspersed with bouts of joy and relief. People around me are somehow always so intelligent and quick to grasp concepts - the same ideas I can take hours and days or even weeks to finally understand. 

When people spend 3 hours to churn out an essay and get an A, I spend 3 days planning its outline and researching, and get only a B+. People tell me to study smart and not hard and I already know that (I have read many articles and books and watched videos on it) but I just don't know why. Over time, when people tell me to study smart and not hard, it sounds more sarcastic and hypocritical than constructive lol. 

It doesn't help that I have to work part time and I don't have a domestic helper or automated cleaning machine to clean up the house. Some toxic friends/people I have met mocked me for ""having no life"" outside of family and school. Some commented that I am a ""country bumpkin"" because I don't travel or go for exchange. Some say I'm unfriendly because I don't hang out with them often at overpriced hipster cafes. They don't know that my parents are ageing and getting weaker.  I don't want them to do too much housework or demand for them to pay for my school fees, overseas holiday, give me pocket money so I can go eat some avocado egg toast that looks better than it tastes. 

But I'm not here to complain because I have learnt that complaining is extremely addictive, playing victim to uncontrollable circumstances feels particularly good, but it is also very unhelpful. Nothing is going to change for the better if I sit here and cry about how bad my life is. 

Look, I know its hard and I know everyday feels like giving up when there's no visible end in sight. You don't know if things will eventually turn out well and you don't know whether your hard work will pay off.

But you have to remember that in this moment, despite all the uncertainty, your best option is to keep trying even if you fail repeatedly. There is no shame in trying your best. Of course it sucks not to see rewards when you keep trying so hard but at least you can be accountable to your conscience and be absolutely free of guilt when things really do not turn out your way. 

Others who make you feel bad about your life problems should be ignored. I have cut off toxic people in my life and while I am left with only a few friends, they are more than enough. Sometimes it's lonelier to be with the wrong people. 

You are not a let down when the outcomes don't reflect your hard work. It's just that things can and will never be the way we want to, no matter how many excel spreadsheets you create to plan some ideal vision of a future you strive for. It is this that is what makes life interesting. 

Hang on and stay strong.

She is the sweetest, most attractive and most genuine woman I've known, but this statement is only applicable when she is in a good mood. Recently, we've been in a series of arguement and she is currently giving me the cold shoulders, on and off. For instance, last week, she desperately wanted to have her milo dinosaur, but since she was down with the flu, I stopped her and gave her warm water instead. She got pissed and stopped eating and simply watched me eat instead. The next day, she was back to her normal self again.

However, few days later, we argued again about cleaning her room. We have been living together for 2 months, with a maid, in another apartment, owned by her parents. Usually the maid will do the chores but she is on leave for 3 weeks due to some family issues at her hometown, so naturally, we had to do the chores. I started to tidy her room, including the wardrobe, toilet and her makeup table for her as it is in a mess, and vacuum it right after, but she got irritated, and questioned the purpose of arranging stuff when it's gonna be messy later on. Okay, I admit, I'm a clean freak so I cannot stand how messy things are. So, she got angry, and I've got chased out of her room since then. She doesn't even want to talk to me now and have been out with her girlfriends everyday to avoid me.

Yesterday night, after she got back home, I tried talking to her since I feel that things need to be fixed in this relationship. Although she was playing games on her phone and acted like she wasn't listening, I know she was. But she simply didn't want to contribute anything to the 'discussion'. I'm at wits end. I still love her, I'm willing to do the chores for her too but I feel like this relationship is reaching it's end after this fight. Love experts, help me, how can I make her things better. Please don't advice me to break up, because it won't be an option, unless she sincerely wants to.

427,"Hi all, would like some advice from you guys. I had just returned from an overseas vacation with a group of friends, including my female best friend. Some background info: we have been friends since JC (we were from the same CCA) and click tgt really well; she has a fun personality and is considered attractive? But I have never considered her a potential romantic partner, rather more like a sis to me. However, at the end of the trip, I realised that I had unknowingly started catching feelings for her. I really do not want to jeopardize this friendship and make things awkward between us. Furthermore, she is currently happily attached too, so confessing is definitely out of the question. May the kind people here on NUSWhispers kindly advise me on how to stop experiencing feelings of attraction to a best friend, yet not totally isolating myself from her? It is making me feel really miserable...

1) OVERLOAD in year 1,2 and 3. Meet all the requirements to take year 4 (level-4000 modules).
2) Bid for level-4000 modules when you are just in year 3 semester 2.
3) Compete with year 4 student for a slot in the small seminar classes.
4) Let them hate you coz haters gonna be hate.
5) Post on social media that you got your modules.

But seriously? Undergrads complaining they can't get their modules? whose fault? complain about faculty, complain about staffs, complain about your seniors/juniors, complain this complain that.

429,"I met this girl J during a volunteering experience in May this year, and we've been going out and messaging daily since then, even after the event ended. She isn't the most bedazzling or cutest girl out there, but one of the most even-tempered, sweetest and most rational girl I've ever met. We've been out on quite a number of dates and try to meet up about once every week or so. However, we've never kissed nor hugged nor even held hands or ""made it official"" with our friends and families, and I feel like the relationship/ this dating phase is getting a bit stagnant... I don't know how to take it to the next level and I don't want to rush things, but 7 months feels a bit long (doesn't it?), especially since most people I know already go to 'third base' within the first 3 dates. I've asked her this before but she always give a very non-committal answer and seems rather uncomfortable. I'm not sure if I'm the problem or she is waiting or just not ready? Not just physically or sexually, but emotionally and spiritually as well. Thoughts? We aren't exactly young either (24/26) so if this doesn't work out I don't want to hold her back... I've never felt this way with any other girls before and J is really really special to me, but I'm feeling a bit stuck at this point to be honest.

Recently, it seems like our relationship troubles are irreconcilable and the possibility of breaking up seems to be more and more certain. He has mentioned this once or twice and while I do love him a lot and am saddened by it, I feel like breaking up is the right thing to do too. The thing is, I dont want to lose a good friend after so many years of friendship/ relationship. He is truly my best friend and losing him would be so hard. What is the likelihood that friends can become lovers and friends again after? Has anyone here stayed friends with their exes?

I don’t wear sleeveless tops or dresses because I’m insecure and I feel that my arms look really fat. At first, I had no problem with my body. But as I grew older, my mum constantly criticized my body, and my sister also liked to call me fat because she’s way skinnier than me. I tried to laugh it off and pretended that i didn’t care. But I did. As I looked through social media, everyone seemed to be pretty except me. I can no longer look into the mirror without feeling sad, even though my friends try to encourage me and say that I look skinny. Recently, I have a wedding dinner coming up and my mum forced me to buy a dress because ‘你的衣服没有一件可以见人’, which loosely translates into none of your clothes are nice. When I try to buy clothes for myself, she would either say it’s ugly or I look fat in it. And I would feel like crying and have no mood to shop, which is probably why I have limited clothes in my closet. It’s so hard to love myself, what should I do?

PS. I’m not blaming my mum because she doesn’t know that I’m kinda depressed about it.

Like for e.g. if you apply for some things they may ask of your past experiences. If I say that I was an officer in the army, how much of a benefit would I get over my peers?

Also, how is the culture like among peers in daily life depending on your former rank, for guys? For example if you were a men would you get looked down versus if you were an officer would your male friends show more respect to you? For e.g. if I were to apply for a CCA club president role, would people be more likely to vote for me if I say that I have more leadership experience in the army?

If the answer to all the above is “no”, can some fellow former officers who are already students advise what kind of other benefits can we expect to get in the university, including intangible ones, for those of us who were formerly officers?

Even though he denies it, I realised that he doesn’t make any effort to meet me properly. Whenever he asked to meet me, it’s either work related or a place to chill. I actually gave up on this date already. 
However, recently I think he invited me to a family event the next day while he was kinda drunk? Wasn’t sure if he was drunk as he was still capable of walking and eating but he sounded drunk when he called me. 
I didn’t really believed his sincerity in the invitation as that was so unlike of him.
Next day, he kinda airplane-d me. When asked him about the event, he just ignored me and told me he reached his family event late etc.

Most of the time its other people (not my friends) who asked if xxx or yyy is my boyfriend, though they are not. It makes me feel like cutting them out of my life.

Nobody have ever confessed to me, and my guy friends either say they never wanted to get married, see me as a bro or that they don't wish to lose our friendship because I'm the nicest female friend they had, plus I always give really good advice.

Sometimes I wish that maybe someone, among my guy friends had actually liked me a bit since they can be really nice to me like (all 1 to 1) volunteer to drive me to and fro from home to a destination because I had too much things to carry, invite me to his house and cooked a really nice dinner, walk me home when it is very late, treat me a small meal here and there.

No skin-ship was involved in any of the activities and they didn't even stand close to me so no flirting was involved also. Without me saying anything they will sometimes reject me directly like calling me bro or reiterate our strong friendship. It makes me feel kind of sad sometimes.

Maybe I'm just chasing something that doesn't exists. And I should appreciate the friendships that I have. Sigh.

454,"There is something which I would love to get off my chest and rant about, not a troll post here, I would love to get some advice comments about this. No hateful comments here please :(  Sorry for my not-so-fluent english. 

Long rant ahead.. 

Story 1:

My bf (25y) and I (19y) have been together for close to 3 years. However, something that he have done recently made me doubt our rsl. 

One day when he came home from work he was 'not being the usual him' and was talking to me 'in a very nice way' (?) I knew him for 4 years so I could tell if he was hiding from me something/ did something guilty. Immediately i felt something was wrong. I know its wrong to check his phone without asking for his permission first but i just cant hold back my curiousness anymore. 

Long story short i checked his phone when he is not around and caught him sexting another gaming girl. My heart was literally aching and I teared up when I saw the conversation. Well based on the conversation on this gaming app i saw, he asked the girl for 'pics', but the girl apparently said she was too tired. The short conversation ended just right there, but before that there were afew phone calls made between them, so this could have happen long time ago without me knowing.

This has happened before, not sexting but cheesy way of talking to other girls online. Trust me, I have confronted him countless times and we 'had that talk before'. I ended up giving myself another chance/hope to forgive him and that it would not happen again. However, i thought that this has gone too far. 

I apologised to him first for looking at his phone without his permission, then confronted him about it and he said he was not hiding it from me (he had password on his phone and i unlocked it to check). He thought it was ok to sext with me knowing? He said he is not hiding anything as he said IT IS SIMILAR TO WATCHING P**N ONLINE ?!? LIKE HOW??! He said as long he's not showing any of his pictures to the other party it does not count as sext?!?! CAN SOMEONE PLEASE ENLIGHTEN ON THIS?!? Am i right or his right on this?!? Instead of showing any remorse, he kinda said that it is normal??!? to do it ??! Obviously i was pissed off and ignore him when he tried to coaxed me the entire night. He asked me if I still want him or not and I said Idk. 

Long story short, I still forgive him the next day because he promised me that he would not do it again. Am I being too nice to forgive him?  He cried and told me he would change and he wants to marry and have a family with me next time... we have spend so much time together and I do not want to leave him as well :( On the other hand, I kinda felt that I was being guilt trip to forgive him... 

Now Im lying on the bed while typing this, doubting my whole rsl with him every night, I am trying my best to trust him but I cry in bed silently at night with him beside me whenever I remembered what happen. I spend some nights at his house with him). I have never felt so self conscious and heart-broken after it happened :( 

Story 2: 

I guess many of you experienced the after-honeymoon period phase after a relationship. I felt like my relationship with him it getting more ""awkward"" as time passes by. We have lesser/nothing to talk about in real life/in text. Trust me I have suggested to go out to try new food/activities, but idk why but it just feels sooooo awkward to me. I feel like we are just sticking together just because we have no one else? I am feeling so tired in this relationship and i felt like we just so used to each other? Sometimes when i try to make conversations with him he just seems disinterested and gives me short reply. I love texting and I used to love texting him, ever since his reply have gotten cold, i have stopped. How i wish he would text me frequently :( 

Sigh I am getting so tired in this relationship, I have though of breaking up... I think me and him would be better off as friends? (I only have a few friends, and they are really busy with school/work, this is the reason why i was reluctant to break up with him, I was afraid to be alone). 

His family loves me so much, especially his mom who treats me so well, I can't bear to leave them :( 
To note, My bf does not mistreats me in anyway, he often buys me food i love and things i like for special occasions. I do the same to him too. 

Well I guess i will end my rant here.

We went out on a few dates and he was all over me, being very sweet and wholesome and just caring about everything I did and liked outside of class. We met at a small meetup where local and intl students got together over activities and stuff. He was respectful, and really made me feel like I was some sort of 'soulmate' he couldn't do without. I thought ""wow SG guys are not bad at all. I wish we had more of people like you from where I'm from."" 

Since our r/s had some sort of 'deadline', we had sex (the only time) but I noticed that it felt so uninspired. Like he just needed me as a release and wasn't interested in really making 'love' to me. After we did it, he stopped talking to me. No mention about what will happen with the r/s--I was just kept hanging. No proper goodbyes (I left for home weeks after it happened), no texts, no nothing. It would have been fine if there weren't any feelings involved, but sadly there were on my end. I don't know about him. I felt used and tricked. It made me wonder if that's all he wanted from me, maybe another girl to add on his list. The least I wanted was to be confronted about it.

I just wanted to ask the (local?) guys out there: is ghosting common among you lately? Why do you ghost? Should I just treat this as some jerk I got unlucky with? And am I wrong for trusting someone that easily? I'm still bummed about it.

Guys are already slower than girls by 2 years of NS and it’s a given to provide for the family. And guys will get married with girls with princess syndrome who can’t even cook or clean the house, which guys have to do. And the guys have to be handsome and rich to qualify for those girls. 

Yet for girls there’s no social pressure to keep up with appearance (hence average looking) and they have equal standing with guys unlike other countries. Its kinda optional to chip in to the family finance and they can happily buy their branded bags. 

For guys it’s kinda like responsibility without the benefits and for girls it’s benefits without the responsibility.

Because frankly, I'm attracted to anime girls. 

When i was a younger, i was fat and ugly and socially awkward. Girls wouldn't even give me a second look. My romance life was practically non existent.  I found solace in anime girls. Admittedly, they gave me a false sense of affection (They can't reject you if they don't exist right?) and have been there to fill the void in my heart. 

Fast forward to the present day, i simply can not find a girl that makes me feel the same amount of love and affection towards my 2D waifus. It's not that i don't want top date a 3D girl , it's just that i feel like it's a downgrade in a sense?

I was with my ex boyfriend for 1.5 years and I loved him very much. I put in all my effort, treated him very well and yet he talked to another girl pretty flirtatiously (in my opinion). I wouldn’t consider it cheating now that I have reflected on our relationship. But he didn’t respect me/my boundaries when I pointed out that I was uncomfortable with him talking to this particular girl. He continued talking to her after we broke up and subsequently asked her out.

I don’t want to pin the blame on him, I too have my weak points. What’s done is done and I have to keep moving forward no matter how hard it is. 

Maybe he just wasn’t ready to be in a relationship. I’ve come to realise that you will never be good enough for a man who isn’t ready to commit. And that’s fine, everyone is on their own journey. I hope one day I’ll meet someone who’d put in the same effort as I do, but until then I’ll work on bettering myself for the right man.

How do I stand out in this, instead of letting people steal the credit or freeload from me, be it in school or at work?

465,"Hi, 

There’s this guy who got me a present for Christmas (jewellery), which was really sweet. We just hanged out but I didn’t get him anything, and I’m feeling that I should have been more thoughtful. Since also, vday is coming, so I am thinking of getting him something this time.

But it is really hard to find gifts for guys... Would appreciate if I could get some suggestions? Maybe around $50? Ok to be less, also ok to stretch a bit more.

So guys, if you could help, what would be a nice present to receive from a girl? 

He is sporty and speaks very well. (No cooking or staying at his place, please. Chocolates might be a bit cliche...)

Some context: We are colleagues and recently expressed that we like each other but for personal reasons we are not together and will not be. He says he will continue to care for me so I really want to thank him for everything and let him know that I appreciate him :)

466,"So I messed up. Big time. I got the perfect guy - sharp, funny, very witty and extremely cute. He's brilliant and ambitious yet still level-headed and genuine. We're totally in sync and have our whole lives planned out together and as a bonus, he does romantic stuff like buy expensive gifts and plays my favourite songs on the piano. I could go on and on about how amazing he is but essentially: TLDR, he's awesome. 

The biggest thing is that even after I cheated (sort of) and that went horribly wrong, he still took care of me, brought me to the doctor and all - no judgement. And then a week later, I broke up with him over something completely irrelevant and trivial because I'm a dumbass. 

I know, I know, I'm extremely stupid for letting something this great go. I guess my question is: how should I make it up to him? Even showing up at his place to grovel for his forgiveness doesn't feel enough. What do men want? Chocolate? Flowers?? Clothes?? Video games????

472,"I don't know what to do with my life. The post will be long, and please bear with me.

I have always been considered 'dumb' in Singapore's eyes. 

For PSLE, I was in the NA stream because my grades were horrible. Since then, my parents have always been disappointed in me because my brother was in the Express Stream.

Fast forward to N level, I got pretty good marks (13 points), but I could not make the cut of 12 points for the Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP). I could only go to Higher Nitec (ITE), but my mother was against it as she said that I would forever have a black mark on my education because I went to *ITE* (Boomer logic lol)

So she forced me to go for O level, where I failed badly, I got 32 points, and my Math was ungraded. I have always struggled with math, Chinese, and science. 

Even though my other subjects like humanities, English/Geography/Literature have always been in the As, but in Singapore's eyes, those subjects are irrelevant. Only Math/ Science is king. With 32 points and failing in math, I could not even make it to polytechnic. I had to go to ITE or retake O levels. I was feeling furious because if I had taken the higher nitec option, I would have gotten a chance to go to polytechnic. 

I wanted to retake O levels to get a chance to go to polytechnic. Once again, my mother came into the picture and put me in a private school to do International Baccalaureate. 

But since my O level results were so shit, they made me repeat Year 4 (or sec 4 basically) And once again at the end of the year, I could not cope because being in NA stream, I was never given a chance to do Additional Mathematics or Pure Sciences. However, in this school, I was forced to take Additional Mathematics, Pure Chemistry, and Pure Biology. If I was failing Mathematics and Combined Science, how can I deal with these subjects?

I was struggling badly, once again. I had never learned Additional Mathematics in my entire life nor taken any Pure Sciences, so most of the teachers were wondering why I was there, and some students kept saying how 'dumb' I was to be older than them, but not know these 'simple' subjects. The school wanted to kick me out because they said my results were so bad. My mother begged them to let me stay. So they did. 

Fast forward to after completing the IB, where I had JUST passed by the skin of my teeth with 26 points, IB is out of 45 points. The passing mark is 24. I could not make it to any local universities, plus I did not study Chinese or take Additional Mathematics for IB. 

Once again, my parents were disappointed because both of them are from NUS, and they always had high hopes for both of their children. My father regularly says what a disappointment I am and how embarrassed he is of me. 

He always compares me to his nieces and nephews, says how much smarter they are than me and how stupid I am.

I just wanted to stop studying and work. My mother told me I HAVE to go to university. Otherwise, I will die poor, and she will disown me because I am a failure.

I tried applying to 3 overseas universities, and I got rejected for everything except for one, which was Australia. I had high hopes for Canada as the course I wanted was Geography, but my parents said no because that course could not make money.

But the course (that my mother chose) was something I knew that I would struggle in. It's heavily Science and Mathematics based, and after many experiences, I know that I will most likely fail and struggle because these subjects are something I am not strong in.

The thing is, my mother has applied for everything and I will be leaving next year, but I do not want to. I know it will be challenging, and my parents told me I have to pay them back for every single cent spent. I did not even want to go to university in the first place, and now I have this burden placed on me. I'm scared, and I don't know what to do. 

I will be all alone in a foreign country, and I can predict that I will be struggling very hard. It's not that I'm lazy, please understand me. I am just not wired to understand Math/Sciences, but I am pretty strong in other aspects like English/Literature/Geography. To my parents, with a degree in any of these subjects, they are useless, and I will not be able to amount to anything in life. (According to them, that is.)

I'm just a little bit miserable, and I don't know what I want to do with my life. I'd instead choose to work than continuing to study.

Being evergreen I am not sure if this is true... I have tried to chase guys before but it didn’t work out... so perhaps there is some truth behind what my friend said... maybe by chasing the guy I am actually pushing him further away. 
But I also see girls chasing guys and end up getting the guy... I am really so confused. But what I do not like about this advice is that do girls really need to be so passive in this era? what is wrong with pursuing what we want? Do I really have to patiently wait for the correct guy to appear and chase me so that I can finally get what I want??

480,"Warning... read only when you have lots of time cos super long confession ahead!

I met a guy while on internship. He was cute, street smart with a great toned body, but very much attached,  so we kept our friendship on a professional level for some time. I just came out of a long term relationship then as well. However, I was frequently being hit upon by some disturbingly low EQ colleague and he would come to my rescue and glared him off.

Anyway, after remaining cordial for 2 months, we were both assigned to handle a project which involves lots of research and report writing. Hence we had to be constantly together during office time, and after work, we would frequently meet up to try and finish the work load.

During these times, we would inevitably talk about our own lives, and our aspirations etc. He was having some problems with his gf then, and he was unhappy as everytime he tries to leave, she would threaten suicide. I just listened looked at him empathically, but did nothing.

However my feelings for him grew stronger subconsciously.  Somehow I just waved it off cos you know, I didn’t want to be a third party. One day while in office, everyone else was out for meetings, and only the interns were left. We were typing out a report when I felt him stroking my head, longer than just a friendly pat. I didn’t know what to do. So I pretended that nothing is happening and carried on typing my report. But my heart was overflowing with emotions... how how???

Anyway, the bosses saw the project was progressing well, and gave us extra workload (and extra pay! Yay!) so we had to spend even more time together (yay?). Then one day, after collecting materials at the library, we went to his room to finish up the reports. I didn’t expect anything to happen, but he held me close, and kissed me. It was such a long passionate kiss, pent up from months of holding back. I was elated, but yet was extremely torn and guilt ridden. When the guilt overcame the happiness, I pulled away.  I asked him about his gf. What’s he to do? He sighed a very long sigh, and said he will try to settle and will think of a way.

I’m not sure whether he did sort things out with his gf, but I ended up being someone whom I never thought I would be. A “mistress”. I didn’t pester him to leave her as I was convinced that if I treated him well, he would see that I was the “better” choice! No one was married yet! Hence I cooked for him fancy meals, wiped his mouth after eating, patiently took care of  him while he was ill etc. I tried to be the best gf he could ever have. And he reciprocated  by buying me little gifts, suppers or just being there for me. He was really the sweetest guy I know.

It was the almost perfect relationship. I felt very loved, and we would talk about almost anything, except on when he’s going to break up with his gf. And it was tearing me apart. I would sob silent tears at night... for 2 whole years! My feelings never faded over these 2 years.

We were graduating soon, and i knew I cannot carry on this way. It would soon have to end. So I loved him and cared for him even more. And on the day I graduated, I wrote him a farewell letter. I thanked him for all these wonderful memories he gave me but since he was unable to make the choice, I made it for him. I told him to choose her, since all these while with me, I was unable to convince him that I was the better one. Maybe I wasn’t. Maybe she was really the better one for him. 

I then cut him off. Didn’t answer his messages or calls. And my heart bled. It bled so badly, but I couldn’t confide in my friends as none of them knew! I couldn’t tell others as they would say “serves you right” and it’s really serves me right. But I knew I made the right decision, and I would get out of this pain.

I did get out of the pain eventually. He went on to marry the gf. I was glad for him and I have also moved on. Perhaps life is made a bit more interesting with events that barge into your life suddenly, and leave you scars. But these are battle scars I can now look upon smiling while patting myself on the head for as long as I like saying “Well done Strong girl!” :)

The end.

481,"Hi, I just needed a platform to rant about this supposedly fine day. My boyfriend just got back from a 3D2N Bangkok trip with his friends today afternoon. Coincidentally, it's my 21st birthday today and we were supposed to spend the evening together. He even booked the restaurant 2 weeks in advance and I've rearranged the celebration with my girlfriends because of the dinner date. However, during my afternoon lecture, I received a message from him stating that he will be sleeping in and the date will be cancelled as he is quite tired. After reading the message, I simply blueticked him as I was rather disappointed and upset, but also hoped that it was part of a surprise he planned so I couldn't even concentrate during my lecture. However, as time passed, I began to believe that he really stood me up. I understand that he is exhausted from the trip, but who doesn't want to feel special on your birthday, especially on your 21st? Furthermore, I haven't even seen him for the whole day. Or am I just being too princessy like how guys always categorise SG girls?

I'm trying to convince myself that a birthday celebration wouldn't be as important as long as he loves me and treats me like a special someone every other day but I just can't seem to be happy, or maybe at least not upset. Hais seems like everyone's 21st is so fun and they get to spend time with their special one, but I just can't help but feel so empty tonight.

My parents, like most love me very much. They would always check up on my studies, ask if i need money when going out and gave their 110% to support me when enlisting (i.e calling me at night, picking me up from Pasir Ris, buying me snacks for the week). However, they had a shortcoming which only manifested itself after i POP-ed - Elitism.

I didn’t perform very well for my BMT which meant that i got a posting in a non-combat vocation, specifically a logistics quartermaster. So incase you weren’t aware, there are the 4 perceived “Hero” vocations that are seen as the most elite in the eyes of my parents - Guards, CDO, OCS(Not rly a vocation but status symbol nonetheless , NDU). When my parents were always going on about how I have to go to a “Hero” vocation and were absolutely crestfallen when they had heard about my posting. Connections were called and requests were written to various places (All behind my back).

And when those efforts proved fruitless, it was when i realised how toxic they could be when it came to my masculinity. I was berated for being in a 姑娘 vocation which was meant for “useless” people.  They encouraged me to lie during family gatherings to avoid embarrassment. I had stopped receiving emotional support from them (Calls, rides, a simple “how was your day”). On days were i had offs or half days, i would be greeted with a “why are you home so early” rather than a welcome home. They would compare me with my cousins and ask why I was not able to live up to the standards of the family.

One time they said that i would not get any inheritance from them because a “姑娘” does not need money as she is not the breadwinner of the family. That last one really hit close to home as i have never, nor will i ever ask and pry about money let alone family inheritance so for them to think that I was eyeing their money was really heartbreaking to me.

They recently informed me that they won’t be attending my specialist graduation parade which was really what drove me to craft this post. Mum, Dad I love you both and should the time come, I would die for you. Is that not enough to constitute what a “man” should be.

Anyway I’m not here to ask for advice, I’m dealing with it on my own. I just wanted to let future parents know what I’m going through and should you have a son in the near future, I hope you guys won’t adopt the same mindset as my parents. It really hurts.

486,"If you can only choose between having luck in career and having luck in love, which one would you choose? 

My best friend is going to give birth soon. I am genuinely happy for her but couldn't help but feel a slight tinge of envy and hopelessness.

When will such nice things ever happen to me? I have a great bf and a promising career but I don't feel happy at all. I feel guilty for saying this but I don't see a future with my bf. Just like my best friend, I've always dreamed of settling down early, starting a family and being a stay home mom. But my bf and I have different expectations. 

He expects us to settle down only in our 30s. He expects me to continue working even after having kids. He expects me to pay for half of the household expenses. All these seem very reasonable but I secretly hope that he would change. 

My best friend envies me for having a great career. But little did she know that I envy her more for finding such a great guy who is willing to support her dreams. 

When she decided to take a few months' break from work to take up a few courses, her husband offered to pay for her course fees. Whether she is working or not, he never fails to transfer her a significant amount of his pay whenever he receives his pay. Whenever she falls sick, her husband would always take care of her. He also does household chores and cooks whenever he's free.

The best thing is he's very supportive of her throughout their 8 years together. He doesn't expect her to be a housewife or working mum. And coming from a poor background, he's very hardworking, humble and down to earth although he works at a prestigious firm with a crazy huge paycheck.

Am I wrong to want to have a life like my best friend's? She seems to have all the luck in love. Meeting the love of her life at a young age, getting married and having kids, all of which are what she always wanted. 

My parents have always encouraged me to have a career and depend on myself. I don't even dare to tell them that I just want to be a housewife. I also feel ashamed to tell my friends or anyone else about this. Afterall we are living in a modern society where women are expected to be strong and independent. 

If I can only choose between having luck in career and having luck in love, I would certainly choose the latter. But I am sure many of you would choose the former. Because it just seems wiser?

491,"Interracial couple here grappling with the issue of allowance for parents.

To give some background, my parents earned $3k plus combined when I was growing up. They were great at saving up and investing which meant that they were able to retire without expecting anything from me. My family has led a very simple life up to this point (few overseas holidays over many years, home cooked meals most of the time and I gave my parents everything I earned from army and from the part-time jobs I did while schooling) which is the reason for this situation. My girlfriend's parents earned $7k plus combined but have very little savings due to their lavish lifestyle (yearly travels which costs on avg thousands per trip). If it wasn't for CPF, we would probably be stuck financing their golden years (thank you CPF!).

These days, my gf's mum constantly reminds her that her allowance is due. My gf and I scrimp and save for our wedding, housing and renovation so it pains us to see her mum spend money like water. 

The sharp contrast between my parents and her's has made it such that we will end up giving the allowance to her parents begrudgingly. I really dislike this treatment of my girlfriend as an investment.

My idea of filial piety is spending time with my parents, buying things which I know they have a fondness for and also making sure they're healthy and that their needs are met. 

I wish more families had the mindset of paying it forward. I will support my kids, the same way my parents had, and expect nothing in return other than love and affection. This current situation of ""I raised you so you owe me"" has made it unpleasant for alot of young folks. As one of insurance ads said, we will be the last sandwiched generation. Haha

493,"In a relationship, I believe in the saying that you should always continue to ""date"" and ""chase"" your partner, to keep the relationship strong and healthy.

Recently, I feel like my partner has become complacent in the relationship, a few months in. While we always used to send each other a simple good morning text (usually whoever wakes up first will send the first message), now I wake up to nothing. It wouldn't take long to drop a good morning text before leaving the house/on the way to work, right?

Most of the times, I'm also the one to initiate dates and stuff. On the bright side, he does appear enthusiastic enough when I suggest, but it kinda sucks that he doesn't usually suggest plans because he doesn't have ideas on what to do and where to go. I, too, don't have too many date ideas, but I try to put in some effort to research places or think of things we could do together. After all, we only meet once, at most twice a week.

I don't ask for much, a simple gesture or text that shows he cares for me would make my day. Maybe the above examples seem small to y'all but I can't help but overthink that he's just not that into me.

We once talked about friends where one party appears to slowly put in less effort in the relationship and the other party got upset. He said that it was normal to put in less effort once a couple gets comfortable with each other. And I told him I totally disagree with that.

So boys and girls, please don't take your partner for granted! Make sure they know you still love and care for them. Something that seems trivial to you, could go a long way.

494,"So I came to Singapore to do my national service and university although I wasn't really into studying. I've been told I look quite good so over the years I hooked up with a few pretty girls and we've been friends with benefits, meeting up every week or so. They are always so eager to show affection and to be honest I find them a little too clingy. I always treat them very well and since my family is pretty well-off, I pay for most of our outings and even the hotels when we didn't have any place.

Anyway, I try to show them that we are just casual friends (when they ask me about serious topics like what we are, I reply saying that we are still young and should discuss this in the future). But now, most of them are graduating and I feel like they are pressuring me to marry or propose to them. Two of them even asked me to meet their family during the next Chinese New Year and there's a real crazy one. Initially she started stalking me, but recently she even claimed that she's pregnant and wants me to go to the doctor with her. Obviously I ignored and blocked her number.

I'm genuinely perplexed, I understand that Chinese girls are more traditional in ""that"" aspect, but what are they even expecting from me?? To me it's just about mutual enjoyment, having a good time but apparently they don't feel the same way. I guess you can't even treat a girl nice without them catching some sort of feelings.

I'm not saying I am not open to a serious relationship, but I don't think they are worth spending more time on anymore.

495,"Can anyone advise whether 350k in investments portfolio by age 30 is a reasonable target? I think I am on track to reach this amount two years early, so thinking of upping my savings. This is discounting my fully paid-off car and my condo apartment.

Additionally, does anyone know why no females have reached out to message me despite me subtly signalling my wealth? I was under the impression that greater ability to provide is especially evolutionarily attractive, yet despite posting everywhere from NUSWhispers to reddit, I have not have any takers so far. Am I being too subtle?

Next, does anyone know why my friends have stopped asking me out to meals? I think that as the one with the most savings amongst my peers, it obliges me to educate them on proper personal finance, such as limiting Europe vacations to twice a year at most. Yet I have had fewer opportunities these days to share my wisdom. Perhaps I should take the initiative to invite them to lunch?

Oh and finally I am thinking of launching my third startup, as I have identified a business opportunity. This will be buying over the NUSWhispers name and opening up a gym. Because I see a lot of people here like to flex.

496,"Recently I was discussing our future life with my girlfriend and we have some serious disagreements. She said that a man should place career first and work hard for the sake of the family. According to her, one needs to aim higher in life and strive hard to climb higher and do the best. She also said she doesn't see any of these qualities in me. She However, I sorely disagree with her. I am big on work life balance and I don't want to work too hard or join the rat race and climb to be some top manager. I just want to make just a make a decent amount, lead a simple life and enjoy life. I don't know how we can come to any compromise on this, if at all.

497,"I didn't want to admit for quite a while now but I got harassed at work and I let it happen. It's sort of ongoing until now. He forced a kiss on me during a company drink gathering. No one saw it because he lured me to a corner of the bar. I didn't know how to react. I tried pushing him away but I couldn't find the strength to. It was too sudden. I let him kiss and grope me all he wanted. He pulled me to leave with him but I managed to slip my arms out of his grasp and I quickly got away from him to join the main group. Acted like nothing happened. 

After that, he'd regularly find opportunities to be close to me at work. Idk how am I taking this. I just let it happen, is it because I quite like the pursuit? Or I am afraid of him? I really don't know. Whenever I have meetings with him alone, I am afraid but I somehow wonder what is he going to do to me this time. I'm crazy, I'm weak. Idk.

505,"I'm the fiancee of OP (#70137). 

Hey, bb, I'm sorry for giving the cold shoulders recently. I simply didn't want to strain our rs further because of issues like this, moreover, we will get married once I graduate. I've decided to reply you via this platform since you know how I always fire my thoughts out erratically whenever I lose my temper. So I'm doing this, calmly atm.

Believe me, from the moment I dated you, I understand your love for cars. I saw how much you enjoy being behind the steering wheels, be it learning how to drive, the first time you actually drove me around for dates and to this point of time, deciding whether to own one, has always been your lifetime dream. But I just want you to know that it isn't ez to own one in SG. Not only the depreciation is insane, you still have road tax, insurance, petrol, maintenance fee etc. I'm not doubting your ability to own one, I believe you will, but it isn't the right time now. No doubts your salary is remarkable for a fresh grad, I'm proud of you if you don't know, and I know you will be paying off your tuition loans very soon, but we still have the wedding, honeymoon, our flat etc, and I wouldn't want the car to add on to your financial burden.

Maybe wait a little longer for me to graduate, find a stable job and for us to settle down into our new flats before owning one? By then, I will also be able to share the burden with you and hence, give you my 100% support. Pinky promise? You know I don't break them.

You don't have to worry about me. As you know, I'm either heading to school, home or library. And as for our dates, I'm totally satisfied with it, just that final year has been tiring me out, hence the lack of enthusiasm. My apologies on that but to let you know, I still love you, okay? I've spoke to my dad a few days ago and he is willing to lend you the car when he is overseas. Otherwise, we can rent one occasionally on the weekends. So are you willing to compromise? Text me when you are ready to talk about this topic calmly alright?

506,"hey there. I’ve been on exchange and the past few months have been refreshing. I’d like to share some thoughts

In NUS, I constantly felt stressed about not having enough friends, not having good enough grades, fussing over internships and job prospects and other people’s opinions... I was constantly preoccupied with school, projects and worries and it made me feel anxious to the extent that my work ethic dropped considerably due to a lack of motivation.

Now that I’m on exchange, the change of pace freed up space in my mind to think properly. I stay home or take walks, thinking about my own opinions rather than what others expect of me. It was scary to realise that I’ve been living my life as dictated by society for so long that I had no idea what I wanted, or even liked, anymore. 

It took awhile to let the thoughts sink in but you know what? You and I, we don’t need to get jealous and compare ourselves to others. Learn for the fun of it, grades can be an afterthought. Keep being amazed everyday about smtg that interests you. Keep in touch with those who matter and realise that social media is a facade. Do work that YOU find meaningful and is aligned with your purpose. 

Remember that hobby you ditched years ago because you thought it wasn’t practical? It’s not a waste of time. Life is to be enjoyed not endured, go and do the things you love, with the people you love. 

There was no real point to this post, but I hope those who felt the way I did could take a step back to re-evaluate your life, and yourself. Know that if you’re not happy, you can change it, now. Good luck, I hope you can lead the life that you find fulfilling :)

He replied almost instantly and was shocked that I contacted him LOL. So to cut things short, since both of us felt the same way, we decided to go on a simple date on 2 days later to catch up. The date was fun and he made me feel so comfortable, totally different from what I expected it to be (thought it was gonna be awkward). He didn't change much, still that handsome, sweet ass boy, maybe only a little more mature (?) and I’m so grateful. So, I apologized, but he mentioned that it was partially due to his insecurity too, so I guess he isn’t blaming everything on me??? Anyways, 2 weeks have passed and just 2h ago, we’ve got into an official relationship again. Isit too fast but ya we promised that we ain't gonna be immature again.
So, I just wanted to thank all of you who’d encouraged me to follow my heart. That was all I needed, that little push to tell him how I feel. Oh ya and remember the girl in his insta story? It’s now my friend haha and she was already attached way before we got back together! She’s a rather cool girl so I can’t believe I actually got jealous of her at first LOL.

509,"I am a final year male NTU undergraduate going on internship in semester 2. Thought I should start my search for my significant other. Never dated or had a relationship before. I feel I am mature enough now after observing my parents and elders.

I met a NUS girl during summer 2019. I was attracted to her outgoing personality, and thought that she was straightforward, down-to-earth and mature. I felt that she appreciated that there is a diversity of people i.e. every individual is made differently, and each of them is perfect and imperfect in many ways. (To some people, this is known as empathy, or putting oneself in other's shoes. But this is just the way I view it.)

I asked her out but she said she didn't have time, but will keep me updated on her availability.

I texted her 3-4 times after that about casual topics, NOT about meeting up, NOT chasing for her availability. However, I did not receive a single comment from her. I gave her the benefit of doubt: busy school schedule and CCAs.

I consider myself to be an exceptionally patient person. This, I learnt from observing my parents. Is there anyone who dislikes a patient (boy/girl)friend?

After pondering one semester, and consulting my friend about the situation, I now know (or believe that it is most probable...like 99.99999%), she is uninterested and thus, ignoring me to reject me.

I am (very) disappointed with her, NOT because she rejected me, but because she chose ignorance. I thought she was more mature than what her inaction suggested.

Yes, I can imagine putting myself in her shoes. How would I feel and react if someone asked me out, but I am not interested? How do I politely reject this person? What if I misunderstood a friendly gesture as a romantic advancement?

Before meeting this ignorant girl, I had a crush on another girl. I was impressed at how she managed to explicitly say she was attached, but in a tactful and polite(?) way. Wow...so that's why she is already attached: her maturity. 

I am not asking to be rejected in a polite way (although I will appreciate it and wish you all the best nonetheless). All I ask is for some respect. I feel disrespected when you ignore me. It is worse than saying ""I am not interested in you."" Just say ""no"" and I won't bother you. I am not some immature pestering bugger who begs for attention. Not all guys are like that. For **** ' * sake.

As 2019 draws to a close, I reflect upon the lessons learnt in my journey to find my significant other.

Life is too short to play stupid games.

I want to be straightforward. I find speaking face-to-face better than texting due to the subtle body languages. After all, you are going to live with your significant other and see each other in person daily. There is no need to hide behind screens. No time for second guessing. However that doesn't mean I rush into things. I will try it out. If it doesn't work out, well so be it, let's wish each other the best. If it works out, well...

I'm just a boy, standing in front of a girl, asking her to love him.

I was once in a situation like yours and I denied to have dinner at Popeyes and we went to a porridge stall opposite ponggol nasi lemak instead. And as absurd as this sounds, my girlfriend literally walked all the way to Kallang Wave to get that stupid fried chicken, leaving me behind at the porridge stall. But lo and behold this bimbo got lost on the way home LOL not sure why she didn’t use grab, I think cos she didn’t link her card, nor did she have enough cash, and she didn’t bring her ez link with her, she had to resort to calling me for help. Ended up after we reached home, she ate a bit then gimme the rest already. Anyways, what I want to bring across is, girls also have pride de, since she is willing to listen to you that night, although she seems like she isn’t, means she has cooled down to a certain extent already, so it’s your turn to apologise (no matter if it’s your fault or not JUST SAY THE WORD SORRY) and give her a hug after that. In chinese is known as 给台阶下 y’know? Also, one thing you should know is that saying sorry doesn’t mean you lost the argument, it simply reflects your maturity. At the end of the day, you still want her right, so this is the only thing you need to do to win her back, which makes you the ultimate winner.
 
Oh yes and as much as I agree that girls should be treated like princesses, don’t ever touch her things when you’re at her house, it goes the same way as how you don’t like you mom or girlfriend or any other human being touching your gaming consoles right??

511,"I recently attended a reunion session with a few of my NS platoon mates, including the sergeants and lieutenants who were with us during our mandatory service period.

Throughout the session, some of the sergeants and lieutenants shared that they had dreams of furthering their education in universities, but are unable to do so because they either lacked good grades or needed to be financially stable as soon as possible (because their family isn't well to do). For one particular lieutenant, he shared that he came from a broken family and had to help his mum with taking care of the children and family chores during his primary school time. And because of that, he wasn’t able to keep up with his studies – thus, performing below average for his PSLE and O levels. This carried on to his JC life where he had to work part-time to support his mother and siblings. Moreover, he also shared that he felt ‘tremendously envious’ of his university friends whenever they were talking about their school assignments, CCAs, project work, and other academic stuff that he would never be able to experience in person. Upon hearing that, a part of me felt really guilty because I’ve always complained about my tertiary life without ever thinking once about the people who had to forgo their study opportunity because of their family circumstances. It was such an emotional story that a few of us had trouble holding back our tears…

Tbh, I’m so grateful to have attended the reunion session right now because I’ve learnt to see education as a privilege rather than an entitlement. My only regret is that I wish this realisation could have come earlier… 

So for those who are struggling in university (like me) or are crumbling under the academic pressure (like me again), please don’t give up and know that there will always be people rooting for you by your side! If you’ve none, I’ll be your first! Please cherish this study opportunity/privilege that you have! ????

512,"After meeting people from around the world, I realised how toxic asian culture is. We constantly compare ourselves to others-- we have to copy what other people are doing so that we don't lag behind, without thinking if what others are doing is actually meaningful. We work our entire lives to attain superficial status symbols -- money, cars, branded goods, etc. without asking ourselves if those material objects actually make us happy. We never give thanks when things go well but when other people don't live up to our expectations we never hesitate to make our voices heard. People complain 24/7. Ironically, our egos are so fragile even the most constructive criticism is seen as an affront to our dignity. Honestly, coming back to sg and being surrounded by negativity makes me feel so suffocated every day. Going overseas has also made me realise that Singapore is a really nice country -- safe streets, good food, great infrastructure etc.  I just wish people would learn to be happy.

513,"My dad is a heavy smoker who smokes in front of anyone and everyone literally. Unlike other smokers, he doesn't excuse himself from us when smoking. He just like to let everyone breath in his smoke. I wonder if he's just extremely selfish or he's a sadist who wants everyone to suffer with him? The fact that my brother and I have childhood asthma didn't even budge him in stopping smoking in front of us. 
 
The worst part is that he's smoking contraband cigarettes which smells like poison. Life at home became hell ever since he started smoking contraband cigarettes from his room, with his windows closed, door opened, with his fan blowing the smoke out into the whole house. That time, I didn't have a room of my own and literally felt like dying whenever he snaps the lighter. During my A level year, it's just so depressing that after a hectic day, what welcomes you back home is the smell of smoke. Hence I dreaded going home and tried to stay in school until late night. 

He started smoking that trash since around 2015 and I wonder why the smuggler still hasn't been caught, even though I keep seeing news of contraband cigarettes being found at immigration customs. I actually tried filing a report in the SG customs app as a man used to come to our house regularly to sell those cigarettes wrapped in newspaper to my dad. However, I think my efforts were futile...

Now, I have my own room and can avoid the smoke more but the whole house is still smelly because of him, so I'm looking forward to moving out into my own house. Nonetheless, I'm still worried about my family's health since we are living in an environment like Indonesia with the forest fire... My mum and I wear a mask at home but my stubborn younger brother doesn't... 

TLTR: What can I do to get those illegal cigarettes smugglers caught? How do I get my dad stop smoking in front of everyone or even quit smoking?

People there drive BMW, Mercedes, etc furthermore it’s the convertible cars not the saloon ones, while lecturers or staffs merely drove Mazda (I personally saw an old man getting in the car while I was parking). And they had Harley, Ducati, etc After entering the school, people there wore Balenciaga, Gucci, Tommy Hilfiger, etc, while people from NUS, like me simply wore simple outfits, either from Uniqlo, H&M, etc or simply some school t shirt. It makes me wonder how rich are they just to wear those expensive clothes to school and it sucks to think that life is so unfair that people get to be born with a silver spoon, where they probably get to inherit assets from their family, whereas people like me, has to put in so much effort just to get to the position they’re in.

521,"I've talked to a few of my male friends and they faced similar problems. I'm 22m, from SoC, currently on exchange in Europe. 

One of the things that local students sometimes ask is about my time in NS. I would talk about NS with fellow NS men as it was a common experience, and learning about other vocations is quite interesting. But I felt uncomfortable when the local students ask me questions about it. I couldn't use military jargon and acronyms, and had to keep explaining boring details that most Singaporeans would know about.  Why can't the locals understand that it's not fun to talk about our experience because it's just a one-sided explanation of how our nation's defence works? Talking about it with the local students felt like I was giving a lecture, so I regularly steer away from the topic. 

So because I don't like talking about it, I guess I gave a disinterested vibe whenever they ask about it. Most of them didn't take this too kindly and that's where the problems begin. Over lunch one day, I was with a group of 4 locals and another exchange student. The topic of military life came up, and I gave short responses when asked. The local students initially tried to squeeze more answers out of me, but I continued giving short responses so one of them snapped at me and said along the lines of ""Why are you so aloof when we ask you about your time in the military? Do you think you're better than us because you served?"". I was stunned, so I looked to the others in the group for affirmation, but they seemed to agree with what he said. No one stopped him or asked him to calm down, like they all felt the same way as he did.

Back in Singapore, people shared fun stories and it's okay to occasionally interrupt to ask questions if we get too technical, especially when girls are around. But even then, most Singaporean girls would know of the basics of NS. Why can't the locals understand that Singaporeans don't like to talk about NS unless we're sharing interesting stories? Was it wrong of me to be disinterested when the topic arises? I still answered their questions, I just didn't elaborate like they expected me to. What do you guys think?

These are average sentiments from hearsays/rumours/conversations
CS majors start on average 4.5-5k
Biz students 3.5-5k
Engine 3.5-5k
Civil servants start at 3.5 to 5k

Of course there exists the lower or upper bound. But thats not 'average'.

The next more important question is - no combine income of 7k you dare bto or start family? 

2 cents. 

PS NUS/NTU/SMU grads do command higher salary on average. Dont ask me why, its industry standards/impression. There are many private u guys who have great well-deserving high paying careers as well. Lets keep to the aggregated numbers for the sake of the conversation.

530,"I've just got engaged with my gf of 5 years. The rs has always been stable despite some ocassional conflicts, but we've already settled them. But recently, there is this problem. I've just graduated last year and found a job related to my degree, receiving a salary of 4.1k, which is the average salary of people with my degree.

So, my fiancee and I have BTOed, currently waiting for our flat and our wedding ceremony will be held a year later, after she graduates from uni. Since I came from a much humbled background as compared to her, my family and I would usually take the public transport, or at most grab/rent a car on rare ocassions. Since I'm currently working with a decent salary, I've decided to purchase a car so that it would be much convenient for everyone and I can bring her out on dates more often too. However, when I told her about this plan, she doesn't seem to understand things from my POV. She mentioned that we will be spending lots of money on our new flat, wedding dinner, honeymoon, my tuition loans etc and the car would be a financial burden. Basically she hates the idea of me owning a car, despite giving in to her by choosing a cheaper car. She mentioned that owning a car in SG is equivalent to burning money away since it's COE only lasts for 10 years, hence the depreciation.

Okay, so everytime we get into this topic, she just doesn't seem to give in and we have been in this conflict for about 2 weeks. And I'm honestly so fed up. She knows that I love cars since young and owning one is my lifetime dream. I'm super lost right now, how should i convince her to let me own one?

She became cold towards me lately, even coaxing her with food doesn't help like how it does in the past. Although she doesn't ignore me, I can tell that she is very unhappy by her attitude through the phone or irl. I did not expect her to react in such a way since she grew up from a rather wealthy background and travelling by cars were her go to. But she mentioned that she didn't want her parents to support her after we get married. I really don't like to see her being unhappy, but I really want to own one car.

531,"Hi just wanted to ask for some advice because I have never dated anyone at my workplace... 
I have a crush on my colleague but my office is really small (less than 10 people). I get the feeling that my colleague is also slightly into me... but of course I may be wrong. I’m just wondering what are some ways to get closer to him without arousing the suspicion of people around because they are very gossipy. Also in the event that if he isn’t interested at least I will be able to get away without embarrassing myself too much... 
it’s really painful to like someone and not do anything about it...

534,"NUS Architecture student here. I think it's about time everyone knows the kind of stuff NUS architecture students are going through or have at least gone through: 

1. There are tutors who brag to other tutors that ""their students do not sleep"". Wtf kind of teaching methodology is that? Are design students expected to be creative without basic ample rest? Many often say that NUS is not teaching architecture the way it's meant to be. Students always stressed to produce, but creativity isn't 24/7 you know?

2. Depression is real among students who cannot keep up. Yet it is often brushed off as a joke as ""nothing can be done about it""

3. The jump between year one and year two is absurd. Year one students barely learnt the basics, and year two students are suddenly assigned with a large scale project. Steep learning curve killed the passion of many potential students, got a feeling the year coordinators do not understand what students have learnt or are struggling with 

4. Current year 2-4 students have no fixed studio space to work on, only the small space at YIH. Not enough space for models to be left safely on the desk, and transportation often lead to models being spoilt. Expecting all students to have such a large table at home? no go.

5. Year 1 to master students have to fight over only 5 laser cutters in the past, now even fewer as some are reserved for ID students. Where are NUS funds being spent on?

The next time you see your architecture friend out there, give them a pat or hug. They're really suffering. Really.

He's getting old and I'm concerned about his health. 

How do I convince him to eat properly. He's retired so he stays at home every day and he doesn't want to go out at all

I don't want to argue with him over this. Nor do I want to restrain him by force etc. The best case would be to tactfully convince him to stop. But this is hard.

One female friend was even surprised that my girlfriend is both pretty and have big boobs (which is rare in sg). 

However at the back of my head I was thinking that ya she is pretty and has a nice body but a lot of girls in Japan and Korea are like that too.

I really like what I'm studying too and so I don't dread having to do work too much. During the semester I'm always occupied with stuff which I really like. 

During the holidays however, my mood and everything just changes for the worse. I'm not at all close to my family, we don't even talk to each other during dinners and its so awkward. I don't have time to do part time to occupy myself so I find that on days I'm not out/overseas I'm just nua-ing at home. Worst part is, since A levels (like 2 years ago) I've always had negative thoughts. These negative thoughts don't come to me often in the semester, but during the holidays, they consume me so much I have trouble even sleeping. Then when I have to meet people in the day, I end up oversleeping or too tired to even hang out with them.

Was trying to follow up with you over the years to rearrange a meet up with you. Previously when you did the survey for me, understand you are looking more into medical and retirement plans. Would you be available to meet for a short while this month for me to share with you on these areas?

Me: am i reading this wrong? Dec 2014?

Agent: Yes Dec 2014. You did a survey for me at Raffles Place, at that time you said you were working as a xxxxx in a xxxxx

Me: lunch on you if we meet. deal?

Agent: Sure no problem
Agent: would next weekday lunch be good for you?

Me: ok what kind of timing are you looking at... also before we meet and you may consider it a waste of your time and money, i'm not really looking for any plans
Me: so you can say no, if you feel that it would be a fruitless meeting

Agent: Oh do u want to look into the medical and retirement plans? Thought you are keen to find out more thus I dont mind meeting you

Me: i don't really have any idea what medical and retirement plans are. because to begin with i don't really have any insurance except the group insurance with AVIVA 
Me: so if you are asking me if i'm keen, i can't really say because i don't really have any idea what they are
Me: but to be frank, i don't have any inclination to buy any plans if that's what you are asking
Me: just being frank before having you treat me lunch

Agent: If you don't mind me asking, is there a reason why you do not know about medical and retirement plans? And more importantly, are you open to know about them? I'm okay to meet you if you have no intention of buying a plan, no obligation anyway ???? But if you feel that you are not open to listening or finding out about it, then maybe we can touch base again next time when you're keen.

Me: I don't understand your question. Why would you think I'll go find out about medical plans or retirement plans?

Agent: Oh when you did the survey for me, there were questions on medical, insurance, investments and retirement. You selected medical and retirement, thus I focus on these two. Previously trying to arrange with you to discuss on these areas. But then again, so many years already ????
Agent: No worries then. you have my number, you can call me anytime if you have any questions. Have a good week!

553,"Commented this on one of the confession about being fat and insulted. Thought that I should share here too with everyone. Not an expert here though, just wanna share my experience. I hope everyone can view this positively. 

Hello! I was in a similar situation as you. The only difference is my mom won’t insult me but I did reach a point where even she agrees that I needed to do something about my tummy fats at 162cm 53kg.

At that time, I started dating as well. So I started spending money on slimming products, do core exercises (not knowing there is no such thing as spot reduction) and running sometimes. Slowly, I learn more and I know what to do. I’ve reached 46kg now.

I understand the mental and emotional struggle because I was being insulted at by my sis too :( She would say mean things to me and I was very affected sometimes. I was NOT fat. I am skinny fat. My arms and legs are slim but my tummy is fat. However, someone told me to view negative comments positively, try seeing the insult as a motivation to prove what you can achieve. At first I thought, that person doesn't understand me. It's not so easy to do it and I will not be happy to go on a diet and I don't like to exercise. But I keep reminding myself to be positive.

In a desperate attempt to slim down. I purchase a popular product called SoSlim from Fashion Shelter (@fashionshelter on Instagram). It's very expensive but I was desperate and no harm trying from so many positive reviews + it is locally approved. This product works, no dieting or exercising needed but process is slow. Results are evident but super slow. This is based on personal experience though. In 1 week, I lose 2cm around my waist and 1cm around my thigh.

Slowly, I incorporated some core exercises like leg raise, crunches and plank. I run once to twice per month and do 10-20 minutes hula hoop every night. I did cut down about 1 kg after doing this for about 1 month.

Later on, I read articles about dieting. It is true that 70% is on dieting and 30% on exercising. Yes, it's so frustrating to finally acknowledge this but I was determined to slim down (especially I want to wear nicer clothes and I found out that my bf likes slimmer girls, that doesn't mean you should slim down for other people, do it for yourself to look good feel good). I read about intermittent fasting, this is eating in a 8 hours window in a day. But I thought, 8 hours is too less for me so I try to eat within 10 hours window. My weight significantly dropped but I didn't keep track though. I tried caloric deficit too. Meaning, I consume lesser calories than what I burn or something like that. I'd make sure my calories intake in within 1200 per day and I used MyFitnessPal to keep track. Wasn't happy about counting calories all the time though..

WARNING: I ate lesser and tried to skip breakfast too. One day I ate too much at 10pm, the next day, I had a very bad episode of gastric pain and was admitted into the hospital. So don't eat tooooo full suddenly if you go on a diet.

While doing all these, I continued using SoSlim. I had manage to cut to 48kg in about 3 months. I tried going gym after that. My bf helped me a lot when I decided that I want to try weightlifting. Gym is intimidating for me but I overcame it and going with someone helps a lot too. I am currently doing a few of these in the gym: Romanian deadlift, glutes kickback, cable pull (not sure what this is called but I used this to target glutes), barbell squats, abs bench and the same core exercises. I went for a run once a week as well and my weight dropped to about 47.5kg and I was stuck at around that weight for some time (this is NORMAL).

As I start to gym, I started dieting as well. Sounds awful right? Indeed it is but not soooo bad. I stopped counting calories after knowing roughly how much I should consume a day. After the gastric episode, I eat breakfast now. A small bun or anything small is good. Lunch I'd eat normally and anything I want but LESS rice or noodle. Once 80% full, I'll stop. So when I dabao, I'll said LESSS rice / noodle. Make sure there is a meat, vegetable and something else. Dinner I'll go for mixed veg rice WITHOUT rice. Usually I'll order chicken, egg and vegetables. I hate vegetables but I'm forcing myself to eat along with something I like which is chicken and egg. No keto diet because I love rice. Lesser snacking on chips too. No fast food too (one per three months is okay). Lesser sweet drinks too but milo is my weakness XD I'd still snack and eat something sweet still though, like a treat for myself HAHA

Lastly, I was stuck at 47.5kg for some time so I tried taking Apple Cider Vinegar for a week. Didn't see significant drop but I stopped after 1 week and I can see my weight starting to drop again. After resting for 2 weeks, I started drinking for another week along with SoSlim, gym, and careful diet, I finally reached to where I am now at 46kg. I am actually already underweight. However, at this weight, my belly fat is still there. I can't wear tight dress without looking nice at my tummy area. My tummy is totally NOT flat at all. It is still flabby. I'm saying this not to discourage you but I want to emphasize that it takes a long time, give yourself a year. Don't give up! Sometimes it's okay to slack for a week but you have to continue. The reward is that I am able to wear tighter shorts/skirt hehehe

It's 1am so pardon my english XD PM me if you want to know more, I'm willing to help because I understand and I hope to motivate some girls out there! I took pictures of my tummy throughout my journey as well and the difference is significant. PM me too if you wanna see XD All girls out there, love yourself, love your body. Please take care even if you want to slim down to look good okies

So after awhile My boyfriend started getting so pissed because I started spending significant less time with him and he wants me to stop spending so much time with them. okay, fair, so I tried to squeeze some time for him and instead of playing with my friends and messaging them as often. I cut down a little and started to commit more and gave him a little bit more time but when I gave him more time he just wants even more. 

I just feel really stressed. Why can’t I just play with my friends more? Why can’t he be understanding? Sometime I just feel so controlled and stressful. 

Ik it’s unfair for him that I spend more time with other guys but it’s mainly messaging and sometime video games only and because of that.. sometime he asked what am I doing. I will just lied to him and say I’m doing nothing Or YouTube just because idw him to feel jealous. Am I wrong? What am I suppose to do?

560,"TLDR: My best friend is a chronic latecomer and it's really frustrating. 

This is going to be pretty ranty but some advice would be nice too! My best friend (all the way from secondary school, through poly, NS and now uni) is consistently late. Not just 15-20 minutes late but 2-3 hours late. 

In our poly days, we'd study together at my place and he would agree to show up at 10 am but arrive at 2-3 pm because he  ""overslept"" or some equally inane reason. 

When I brought this up to him, he says I'm being unreasonable because no one else has ever given him grief for it. In NS, he was a stayout Pes E Clerk and was still consistently late for it but his superiors never said anything. When he was interning (at a very prestigious company, mind you), he was still late every day with no one saying anything. He’s late to every major social gathering too.  I seriously don’t understand how he has gotten away with it so far. His reasoning if that if his boss, enciks, parents and other friends have no problem with it, he doesn’t understand why I do.

He’s also late for major events - he missed my poly graduation, he was 2 hours late to his own award ceremony, he was also one of the last few to show up at my birthday party despite agreeing to come 2 hours earlier to help me decorate. The list goes on. I guess I’m feeling the pinch of it more now in Uni because we tend to meet outside or in school now and waiting around outside for two hours is infinitely worse than chilling at home for four. I’ve always told him that I hate this late-coming thing but I’ve only started getting more aggressive about it in the past year because I’m seriously super sick of it. Treating me like my time is worthless is one thing but how is that going to affect other people’s impression of him?

Again, when‌ I told him nicely that he needs to stop doing this because it’s rude and he needs to start valuing my time and that the whole world shouldn’t revolve around him, his response is that my time matters less because he’s in Computing and I’m in Arts (seriously?? I love being in Arts btw so that’s not even an insult) and started going into a personal attack, telling me that I’m having relationship problems with my other half because I’m “unreasonable” and “have communication issues”. That was really hurtful. I’ve been nothing but calm and compromising and even he admitted that “it was a personal attack to get you to shut up”!

I’ve been putting up with this for 5-6 years now and it’s really, really frustrating.  He tried to pass it off as “startup culture” at some point but I don’t buy it lol. I guess I’m posting this as a rant but for reals though, what should I‌ do? Is there anything I can even do?

Seriously super hurt right now.

Local born Singaporean here. Just wanted to provide you with some local context. In the previous generation and the generations before that children were seen as assets that made money for the family. So poor families would have many children, some more than 10 kids, so that these kids would faster work and make money for the family.

So let's not sugar coat here. To the older generation kids are assets and money-making tools. Modern day slaves. You can say how there is ""filial piety"", or how we should be grateful for our parents.

I call bullsh!t. This is simple Confucian brainwashing about how the young must bow down and be subservient to the old. This is why you see so many older aunties cutting queue to the bus or food stall. They think they can do whatever they want and its indoctrinated.

To those that say the parents spent all their money on you and you should be grateful - I never asked to be born, and if my life is miserable are my parents going to pay me compensation?

Parents have kids for purely selfish reasons. How your life turns out is the roll of the dice.

If your parents are poor and asking for allowance - adults have the responsibility to ensure that they are able to have enough money for retirement if they are going to have kids. Kids are not cash cows. No money don't have kids.

If your parents are rich and asking for allowance - you are just another regular money bearing asset for them to pad their income. Parents who are rich and don't need any allowance but still insist purely because of the aforesaid Confucian brainwashing.

Children happily do so out of stupidity. Want to be grateful to your parents? There are a million things you can do for them. But giving money to rich retirees is the stupidest thing ever. 

I even read someone saying they ""agreed"" with their parents to give 25% of their income. I congratulate the parents for one of their best investments ever with the highest ROI. Just need 10 kids and their income would be in the top 1%.

563,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years. We are going to go overseas together soon for the first time during my birthday. Is it wrong to want him to pay for me for the trip? We don't usually each other any presents for birthdays/festive seasons and I have only gotten a rose from him on the first valentines day once. Most of the time, I will pay for our meals together. I have been using my savings to pay for the both of us but luckily I am currently working part time now so I am still able to survive. He is a scholar and has a good allowance every month so he dosent have to worry about cash. He thinks that spending money on good food is a waste of money but he would spend a lot more on his hobbies / buying new gadgets. So most of the time, I end up paying for all our dates and can only afford something nice once a year. When I suggested to go on dates more often like once every 2 months, he would complain and say that it is expensive and when his friends invites him to eat at Bistro, he would be more than willing to go. He says it's because he seldom eat with his friends. And when he decides to treat me to something nice, I feel very restricted because he will tend to order so little I am barely full from eating. Although he does give me a bit of cash every few months, it is not enough to cover the expense we spend together everytime. I feel like an ATM to him because he always dosent being his wallet when he goes out with me so I end up paying for everything. Even when I eat with his parents, I have to pay for his drinks. When he eats with my family, we never let the guest pay for anything. 
TLDR I just want to feel pampered by my boyfriend once in a while :( is it just me being a princess? Am I asking too much?

Me and my ex boyfriend (both alumni bunch) broke off almost two years ago and we were from different racial and ethnic backgrounds (I am a chinese and he is Indian). The reason why we broke off is due to our familial and cultural differences. Basically my parents did not want me marrying or being in a relationship with a non chinese guy and his family did not want him marrying a non Indian girl either. We came to a mutual understanding and broke off the relationship because of the familial differences and needs. Fast forward two years and I have realized that it was the stupidest thing to have ever done because it was almost a perfect relationship that we had. I'm not sure if it's too late to even get back together now. I just want to put it out there, since I have witnessed many posts about couples going through cultural differences on this page.... that if you are facing any cultural/racial/religious differences in your relationship which your family does not approve of or could be an impediment...please fight for it if you truly value it...because it may pay off in the longer run. Sacrificing your relationship for your family's 'ideological needs' may seem like the smarter move at the moment.... but trust me it's not..

He then proceeded to ask me how I would resolve the following conflict: "" You and your team members are working on a project that has a strict deadline but you found out that they were actually outcasting you for being tall and dismissing all your efforts for the team, using the excuse that your method doesnt work well for the project and how would you resolve that?"" . 

Of course, it took me quite a while to think of a solution to answer that but here comes another difficult question: "" Our door ceilings are not that high, will you mind bending your head often? We are afraid it will not be convenient for you...""

Has anyone here been through such similar situations? I really want this job because the pay prospects are kinda good....

570,"I wish that in 2020, I can be more decisive for myself and make better decisions overall. In 2019, the main highlight will be myself managed to land a job, but there are a lot of things that I am not sure about.

Firstly, the job isn't related to my studies (science related background). Being a contract worker who wanted a conversion to a permanent position, I worked hard everyday. My superior and colleagues acknowledged and appreciated the effort that I have put in at work. The good working environment and friendly colleagues are some of the good factors that I will missed if I were to leave my current job for another job that is related to my studies.

However, the huge workload that I faced everyday is something that I dreaded. I have to OT till late at night often and though the salary was not too bad, I felt tired easily. I told myself that burnout cannot be happening to me since I am only less than a year in my current role, and I adjusted to my role like within 1 month easily, but the truth is, working at my role isn't something a lot of people will find it easy to adjust to due to its atypical working hours (start late, end even later).

I have another 6 months to go before my contract is up for renewal. I  do worry about my job security as when cutting down of budget is required, contract workers like me are going to be the first to go. My dream of continuing as a permanent staff to enjoy better job security and benefits maybe vanished. 

Pros of continuing at my current role that I have foresee: higher pay if I continue, good working environment, able to learn more things related to the industry, use the free time away from work to do my own stuff

Cons of continuing at my current role : Not able to apply whatever I have learnt from my studies (I have wanted to work in a science related environment such as lab analyst), body clock screwed up completely (shift work), regular office hours may be something that I prefer(?)

 Hope to hear inputs from you guys.

Meanwhile the other courses study like a nerd and do badly for exams. Worse off, Business graduates always fetch high salary, while others find trouble getting employed after graduation.

I don't get why students choose non-Business courses. Do they like to suffr? Business courses yield the highest reward with lowest effort compared to other courses.

My boyfriend and I are(?) together for a little over one year. We were doing well and all but I have never been able to tell him the things that I disliked about him; especially his behaviour and the way the treats me. But recently, I kinda snapped and dropped him a huge bomb of things that I have disliked about him. He took it quite negatively(he claims that I am tired of him???) and tbh I was hoping he would take the initiative to change his behaviour(he always scold me and rely on me on the the daily basis, literally. Felt more like his maid than his gf) because I really love him alot. But he said he refused to change because that is the way he is and he like himself that way. I was hoping that I was enough for him to change.. I am his first girlfriend and there are definitely many times where I felt love and appreciation from him. I tried to be an understanding girlfriend. Maybe my expectations were too high? Oh and he misunderstood that I am getting tired of him because I said that I was tired of his behaviour and the way he treats me. And he never ever admit his own mistakes, it is always me who apologised first. Moreover, he really sometimes give others bad impression of me because of the things he say about me in front of other people. If I were to tell him about his mistake, he would retaliate and push the blame to me instead. But nonetheless, he is pretty selfish and self centered at times but he have never failed to show me love in his own ways until recently. Honestly as I type this confession, I feel like he is a pretty shitty boyfriend but everyone is not perfect. I am sure I am not a perfect girlfriend either. 

Anyhow, as I've said he took things negatively, we 'broke up'. I was a sore loser and I couldn't let him go because he is really my partner and lover. I begged and cried for one more chance. Somehow I got that chance, but recently he told me that he is unsure of his feelings for me ever since that day I took my stuffs back and walked out of the house. So we decided to take a break and I want to give him some time(since he said that he needs time to get hold of his feelings for me again). 

I don't think it was wrong of me to express my feelings but it took a negative turn in our relationship. Do you guys think there is still a chance of rekindling our bond? I really don't want to stress him but I really miss him and the way we were last time. Is there any way that I can make him feel better? I feel sad and it really hurt me when he said he is unable to tell whether he still have feelings for me.. even I can't feel the love anymore. Any advice, please? No trollers please :(

There's so much public scrutiny, some of which are not helpful or even toxic in nature. I feel that this platform has lost its original purpose to ""give students a voice and encourage cross-faculty discourse"". It seems like this page is now skewed towards gaining readership among the public. I really hope that the admin can make some changes to cater more to the NUS students. 

There are other confession pages for other students from other educational institutions to air their thoughts or even pages for members to air their grievances about their organisations/workplace.  Perhaps the non-NUS public can be better served with a ""SGwhispers"" rather than intruding in our supposedly safe environment. 

I question what has this page become? I think the admin need to re-evaluate their purpose of running this platform, especially when they had plastered their ""Admin Note"" of being in the ""limelight"" after being featured by Today. 

Would this post be censored by admin? I hope not.

It all started when one of the days I went over to her place to pass her something but she wasn’t at home and her mom was alone. The maid went out to get something and her dad was overseas. One thing led to another, we had sex. Ever since then, I’ve been going to be place pretending to “pass” her things but actually it is to make out with her mom.

You only have 1 module that takes alot of time and you have ONE rest day, that is more than enough my friend. 18 MCS is so little and it’s the minimum MCs required for each semester based on NUS rules. For us, we have multiple modules that are definitely tougher than yours.E.g  Engineering Calculus, CS1010E etc. I am taking 22 MCs by the way which is more than youts, no choice or I will have to overload for the subsequent semesters.

Sure, FASS has its own diffculties like readings, but we had it tougher than yall definitely. We also have a number of projects and assignments to clear and some can take DAYS to clear, making us have very little time for revision for finals. I have already burned all my weekends (no rest days) for the past few weeks due to that. I have seen people in your course having alot of time to go outing at night for drinking ,mah-jong sessions etc. My engineering friends and I on the other hand, have to sacrificed these and mug instead.

Btw, you already know CS1010E is hell based on the recent CS1010E confessions. It’s even worse to those who do not have much background. I think you will definitely have depression if you experience the hell of it. I dare say FASS modules are easier than engineering modules. Don’t believe? Go and ask around anyone who took both engineering and FASS majors. So please, stop complaining. Thank you.

Recently, my parents and relatives kept trying to pry on my relationship status and are actually worried about how I'm single while my cousins are all getting attached

Do you think it is alright for me to keep being single or should I start looking for a partner? Is it normal for people to still be evergreen at my age? Currently I feel no rush about getting into a relationship and I have no one I'm interested in at the moment, but the people around me are making me feel like I should be in a rush, if not I'll be single for life...

Some background story, I'm an undergrad (female, 21) and due to the nature of my course and also my edu background, the guys in my course are either the same age or younger than me (majority) 
I'm an introvert (but can talk if I'm close to someone) and I dont take part in many school activities as I'm already struggling with my studies even without commitments :(

We became fwbs and enjoyed every moment of it together in secrecy from my friend. After a year of enjoyment, I decided to call it off out of respect for my friendship and to lower the chances of this secret ever getting out (there was no evidence of it).

To this day my friend occasionally rants about his ex from several years ago... and I have to awkwardly nod my head and change the topic as I am reminded of how hot she was in bed.

My girlfriend and I graduated and are working in the accounting industry hitting about combine 7k, we still get put off by the BTO costs. Just the recent BTO 4/5 rooms flats comes to about 400-500k. Thats half a million and way out of ordinary Singaporean's reach.

We also feel slightly inferior as most of my classmates are making easily 4-5k one year adjusted. How to survive in Singapore??

And no, we are not spent thrifts, we give our parents 400 a month, utilities 100 , food 1000 (approx 30 dollars a day), transport 150, passive investments 200, uni loans 500 (35k). Checking accounts leave with about 500-700 dollars each month. Anyth leftover from overbudgeted food goes to savings account too.

We eat out only on the weekends and minimal entertainment or drinking. Weekend travels even to neighbouring countries are out of the question at the moment.

The only saving grace is that we have no plans for kids. This is the reality of Singaporean uni grads. Sometimes I envy my classmates in the banking/cs/consulting sector making 5k easily.

1. Will your boyfriend dance for you for one hour just because you made him breakfast? Will he strum the guitar  while gazing into ur eyes, while singing a love lullaby, just because you helped clean the windows? 

2. Will your boyfriend say “love you” or “saranghaeyo” (the Korean version) daily? 

3. Mosst importantly, your boyfriend may ignore you. He may push you away. He may break up with you, block you on social media, block your calls, and even say to your face “I’m sick and tired of you. We’re broken up, please don’t harass me any more” while maintaining an icy cold glare. 

4. Will a male idol even bother picking fights? Will an idol quarrel with you? Will an idol block you on social media? Will he push you away, accusing you of being “too clingy and irritating” when you fly with him from  airport to airport, from concert to concert? 

5. No, an idol will never reject u or push you away from him. Unlike boyfriends who may get tired if you, an idol will only look at you with sweet puppy eyes and say “I love you”, and croon the sweetest sounding love ballads into your ears (if you have his song in ur phone, u can feel love any time u want!) 

6. And what did I do for my idol in exchange for all the affection? Why, I helped him clean his windows? I helped him wash dishes? No, all I did was to become his fan. 

7. Yeah, all these is fake. Then dating a real boyfriend is real? You sure? Look at the “real” boyfriends pretending to say “I love you forever and ever!” They don’t mean what they say obviously, see how many cheat! See how many abuse their wives and beat them! See how many subject their girlfriends to gaslighting, manipulation, and physical violence! 

8. On the other hand, chasing an idol never subjects you to gaslighting, physical violence, and cheating. Idols are always there for you, whether or not you bother to help them cook, clean and tidy the house.

In the next few days, we talked about what we do to our families to our career plans and ideal family life. Our convos were also punctuated with quite abit of sexual tension. We would often refer to each other as bb, baby or babe and often drop miss you or love you msgs. 

In a week's time i asked her out for our first date and she suggested that I pop by her place. Well I am completely open with fwb ish rs and is in fact extremely excited that she is the other party. A part of me was planning to start out as fwbs and get the girl eventually - cause hot wife material damn. We made plans to meet and we both expressed how much we cant wait to be in each other's arms.

595,"Hello, I would like to share some thoughts. 

When I worked at a restaurant as a server in the past, I would come across so many customers who don't finish their meals. Some of them barely touched it. Sometimes my manager will ask them if the food is not to their liking, but they would just reply by saying they are already full. 

It's funny because they ordered so much food that the dishes are filling up the entire table. 

Please don't order/ask for so much food if you can't finish it. And if you have too much food on your plate, please share it with your friends/family/neighbours. Don't waste food. 

This is not because someone else across the globe is starving, but because many people worked very hard to provide the food for you (think - the farmers, chefs/hawkers, your parents, your helper). As a consumer,  you don't always see how hard it can be to prepare the dishes but it can be a tiring process. People say throwing food away is a sinful waste and therefore an immoral act. I think that it's more immoral to disappoint those who have invested so much into making something for you. 

Sometimes when we bring the unfinished meals back to the kitchen to throw it away, we try not to let the cooks see them because they get sad. 

I hope this resonates with some of you. Thank you for reading.

597,"Honestly, what's with the recent truckload of guy having to pay for girl and all that bullshit. 

My story - Singaporean girl here, met husband in NUS. After 1 yr of dating, we decided that we were serious abt our r/s and started discussing plans for our future (marriage, kids, pre wedding photoshoots, honeymoon etc). We knew we needed a lot of money to make things work and we weren't rich. So while all our peers were partying away, going on couple holidays/staycay/getaways and grad trips; we were there giving private tuition and working our asses off during summer hols. We set up a joint account where we would contribute our hard earned money in. Of course, we had our own personal accounts but it weren't significant. We would scrimp and save wadever we can to make our dreams work. At e start of our r/s, we went dutch with the occasional presents for each other. After confirming that I'm the one for him, he decided to pick e tab most of e time (I'd insist on paying sometimes if its too expensive). As a result, I understand that he will not have much savings compared to me. Yrs later. He grad a yr earlier than me but didnt managed to get a job immediately. As such, he took up waitering temporarily to earn some money - determined to marry me when I grad. 

When I grad, I got a job immediately, earning more than him (even after he changed job from waitering to desk bound). I paid for all our dinner dates. Our wedding - we copaid for our rings, our banquet, our local and overseas pre wedding photoshoots and our honeymoon. Many of our frens were shocked as to how we did it in e year of my graduation; thinking we had financial help from our parents when we did not. Its amazing how 2 of us even saved at least 250k before e age of 30. 

Fast forward till today. We own a condo and have children of our own. I paid double e amt my hubby paid for our condo but I don't draw the lines with him and say hey, you're the man, you're supposed to pay for that roof over my head or I don't wanna marry you. Nah. We work tgt as a team. We support each other when we can. And now when I'm no longer working to care for our children, he pay for all the bills to support our family. 

Moral of e story is - if you love somebody wholeheartedly and see a future with them, work tgt as a team. Make it work. Don't be so calculative. Dreams take flight when you work tgt, not thrash each other.

604,"Hi NUSWhispers, I got accepted into mechanical engineering recently. But right now I am having a dilemnia as to if I should continue with this course or go to EEE / Cs.

I kind of struggle to find link to what mechanical engineering students do in the working world. I chose engineering in poly because I thought that, that was the course that I will do most well. (I did pretty well in EEE too, as I was in common engineering program)
I like both EEE and mechanical engineering on theory, I don't find it to a torture to study it, it's not that I have no interest in it but I kind of don't understand what I will do in the future and if I should study this course.. Idk how to phase it.. 

My understanding is that many people don't really work in the same field? (I find quite irony and I also shouldn't aim for that because wouldn't that be a waste of time but also, I realised that we also study other module and etc.. So it doesn't make sense to be constraint to one industry just because we are mechanical engineering. I alao seem to have the perception that mechanical engineering is like an absolete course? (no offence).

On the curiosity side, I wonder why so many mechanical engineering and EEE students are accepted as compare to other course?

But what he did tonight...I can't get over it. I am terrorized but I don't know how to get out of here.

We got in an argument about me hanging out with one of my close friends who happens to be a guy. He was jealous that I went to watch a movie with him and it was only the two of us.

We were both shouting and I started crying so I wanted to walk away. We were in the kitchen and he threw a plate and said ""don't you dare walk away from me"". I just froze, I was terrified and I didnt know whether he was going to hit me or break something else next.

But he just got closer, took me by the wrist and said ""understand that you're mine. You don't get to act like a slut now that we are together."" Then he kissed me, I couldn't move or say no but I didn't want him to touch me at that moment. He dragged me to bed and he tried to take of my clothes. I started fighting back but he said ""you don't want to resist, we're just going to have some fun"" and he...did what he wanted to do. I was crying and I didn't say a word but he could see that I was hurting and yet he didn't stop. When he was done, he kissed me on my forehead and asked if I was okay. I just nodded, I couldn't talk and I was too scared of him. I waited for him to fall asleep. And now I am in the restroom shaking and typing this. I can already see bruises starting to form on my wrist.

I don't know who to talk to, I don't want to tell my friends if I can. I need help, and I live with him so it's not like I can just take my stuff and go. I can't call the cops, I am scared that if he hears me then he will hurt me before they come. Please help.

Forced to go for tuition classes during primary and secondary school days even though I'm scoring A's in every subject. Forced to go JC when I want to go to a polytechnic to take up music diploma. Forced to study something I don't like in Accountancy in Uni and forcing me to stop my interest in music during studies because 'it will affect my studies'. 

""Boy, you better go study Accountancy or I won't pay for your school fees."" Such blackmail, but what's the best part? FORCED to go do part-time because my mum broke her promise and decided not to fund my uni fees. 

And when I have gotten my degree, when I want to resume pursuing my interest in music, I was forced to start a career in audit. Quarrels after quarrels, arguments after arguments. Then she said, ""listen to Ma for the final time. Go become an auditor, and I will not bother you in any choices you make in the future.""

So whenever she complains that my room has become a music studio after investing in many expensive music equipment.

Whenever she complains I am making too much noise while playing with the instruments.

Whenever she tells me off for spending so much money in my hobbies and interests.

I would shut her up by saying ""you said you won't bother me. Why go back on your words?""

You removed my dreams and my youth. You made me into a monster of your own creation. Now I'm using my own money to get back my wasted youth, and you think you're not in the wrong?

Don't say I'm rebellious. I've always listen to you. But when will you for once ever listen to me? Enough is enough. You said you want me to be happy. But never was I once happy in my life. So shut up, and be thankful my name is not Arthur Fleck.

It wasn’t easy coping with the loneliness and unfamiliar environment but luckily the seniors at my student residence were friendly and helpful. We attended many activities and toured around the continent together. Over this time, I gradually grew closer to this local senior and we started going on trips with just two of us only. In my emotionally needy moments, the senior was there for me while my boyfriend couldn’t due to the time difference. 

Things happened, and I just discovered I am pregnant. Abortion is definitely out of the question as I am uninsured and the abortion bill will be sky high, not to mention the general unavailability of abortion services here. But I also don’t want to go back to NUS preggers as my boyfriend will surely know that it’s not his. I also don’t want to kill my own child and part of me is genuinely curious how a mixed race child of mine is going to look like. Marrying the local senior isn’t an option because while he is fun to date and good between the sheets, he isn’t the stable kind of guy good for bringing up a family (unlike my boyfriend).

How now? Should I try to extend my exchange or take a leave of absence and give up the baby for adoption here?

I'm not joking here. I've secretely started my own company and which is now being acquired. However, I think I'm being seriously low-balled. 

I have no idea how valuations work and all. It started out as a cool side project but then people started taking notice and the project was eventually monetized. Now a big company is considering buying my project for huge (6 fig) sum

Part of me wants to just cashout and reap the rewards but part of me also feels like perhaps there is potential for something more? I am lost. I don't know how to decide. 

Is there anyone I can seek advice from or any resources NUS has to help us navigate this journey? Google doesn't help at this point. 

Also, if I suddenly receive a huge sum of money in my bank account, will I alert the authorities? Like will I be questioned on the origin of the money? 

I haven't told anyone as I don't want my friends to see me differently, I still want a normal uni life. If people were to find out that I own a 6 figure business either they'll most likely want to use me or they'll think i'm just rubbing it in their face. I can't ask anyone in real life as a result. I know this is probably not where I should be seeking advice but I figured someone with the right know-how or the right connections might be reading this. No harm trying i suppose?

619,"Reading post #71864 made me feel very guilty, so here is a confession.

When I was 18 years old, I was horny (like many other teenagers) yet forced to stay at home to study for Alevels, so I started flirting with my domestic helper. Since her English was not very good, I was able to convince her to have unprotected sex. I was also able to convince her that letting me ejaculate inside her would be easier than having to wash the bedsheets all over again. Yes, I know I was wrong. I was a very selfish person back then. 

Eventually, her contract ended and she returned to her home country. Some time later, my family received a phone call from her saying that she was pregnant with my child. Imagine if you were a parent and a maid accused your son of fathering her child. Would you believe her? Of course not! I poisoned the well still further by making up false stories about her stealing money from my wallet etc.  Before long, my family was convinced that she had integrity issues. My family ignored her calls. Eventually, my father got fed up and scolded her over the phone, accusing her of lying, threatening to call the police and asking her to leave our family alone. The calls stopped after that. I was very happy and boasted about it to my friends and NS buddies. Eventually, everyone got bored with my story and I moved on to other conquests, so I kind of forgot about the entire incident. until recently.

Today, with the benefit of maturity and hindsight, I truly and sincerely regret what I did. As a married man now, I completely understand the difficulties involved in raising a child. I imagine that it is orders of magnitude more difficult to raise a child as a single parent. Originally, I intended to fly over to look at the child and confirm whether he is indeed mine before taking further action. However, on second thoughts, I realized that it dosent matter whose child it is: I had done a grave wrong, so I should make compensation irregardless. In addition to a significant lump sum payment, I intend to also sponsor the child’s accomodation, air fare and tuition fees if the child manages to get a place in NUS in a few year’s time. And I will NOT do any paternity testing.

My boyfriend and I will be going on exchange and while we'll be in the same country, we'll still be around 5 hours away from each other. We're considering embarking on an Open Relationship and allowing each other to explore and experiment with other people while overseas and I'm wondering if there's anything I should look out for that could potentially ruin our relationship. 

For more context, we're already in an Open Relationship here (we attend different unis). We actually do spend a lot of time together and like each other very much. We've got a strong relationship and vibe very well together, we just both like the idea of casual hook-ups a lot and didn't see why we needed to give it up just because we're officially attached (although we do intend to be exclusive at some point and have already begun to taper off the casual sex rather than just cutting it off completely so it becomes less sudden...) We don't have any problems with jealousy and are open with each other when it comes to discussing who we sleep with and how we feel.   

However, I'm also aware that having a long-distance open relationship has a vastly different dynamic from one where we see each other three times a week. And things could be potentially more dangerous overseas   (sorry if I'm being paranoid but sexual assault? college drinking gone wrong?? more STDs to pick up??). Have any other couples done this before? What happened in the end? Any problems to look out for? Any important questions to ask before we start on this?

Eventually, I gave up and found another guy (non-Singaporean) who is studying in the same university. I moved in with him last weekend. Everything seems to be going well, so after much deliberation, I have made my final decision: I am going to break up with my singaporean Bf.

The problem is this: when I left for exchange, my Singaporean BF transfered me a sum of money for rent and living expenses. Since I intend to break up with him, should I return his money? On one hand, it feels weird to be using an ex's money. On the other hand, my personal finances are quite tight right now, and even though my non-singaporean BF does not charge me rent, I still need to spend quite a bit on living expenses. Maybe I should return some % of the money and keep the rest? I have been overseas for approximately 2 months. The entire exchange programme lasts approximately 10 months.

Quite a while back, I started dating this girl I met from Maplestory, but I recently found out that she was also dating some other guy in real life?

I thought that since we had something special even outside of the game, we were ""official"". But when I confronted her about it, she insisted that to her, in game relationships are a separate issue and that I'm not really her boyfriend?

I don't know why but I just felt so hurt by that because I always treated her special and finding out that she never felt the same way about me after all these months just hurts so bad.

Am I the only one who takes his relationships even in game seriously? I mean, if we never talked outside of the game I would maybe understand but it wasn't just ""in-game"" to me... I'm just so angry at myself for getting so worked up over something so stupid, and something that even she doesn't care about... I'm just so dumb...

But the issues is they hang out like almost every single day and since making “these few guy friends” our messages and convo dropped significantly and even when I’m back in Singapore she stopped hanging out with me.

This is making my job-searching process even more heartbreaking and tiring.

If a girl would to surprise you with flowers how would you guys feel? By the way its really expensive too sigh... Why are flowers so expensive?! Also after reading the posts about the flowers, can I suggest to the couples out there to buy a pot of plant instead because they survive longer. Flowers too mainstream right?

635,"I graduated some years back from NUS with a computing degree. Unlike my peers, instead of settling for a typical IT career, I devoted myself full time into an MLM that I had been involved in since my university days. The MLM, of Middle Eastern origins, is in the business of providing motivational and life coaching to participants. Participants were highly encouraged to give back to the MLM for the benefit of themselves and others. With my fellow directors' efforts, we grew the MLM to be one of the largest in Singapore and the region. The revenue grew to a level that my family and I could afford to move into Sentosa Cove.

However, even though all seems smooth sailing, there are problems unknown to others. Chief of which is my wife, or rather her dream. She loves singing and always harboured the dream to have an album of her own. Our MLM is also exploring using music to spread our motivational and life coaching messages to even more people. Getting her to front this project would be a nice fit. Yet, I feel uncomfortable that in a way, the MLM is sponsoring my wife's personal dream. I am also disturbed when preliminary talks with some music producers involved musical concepts on Chinese alcohol which may not be a good fit for our wholesome motivational and life coaching corporate messaging.

What should I do? Should I choose to fulfil my wife's dream with the MLM's financial backing or to let a neutral third party decide for the greater good of the MLM?

Recently there is this guy who I have went out with before and has been asking me out ever since. I didn't want to reject him directly so I told him that I was busy. But once in a while, he would check in on me to ask me out. So I just ignored him and basically blocked him on all social media lol
Is that the right thing to do? Do I need to explain to him that I am not interested? Do people really need closure?

641,"After graduating, I'm earning 2-3x what most of my classmates make. I scrimp and save/invest 70-80% of my salary. It pays off. I own 5 properties (with loans), a nice cash hoard, stock portfolio and a car (without loan). 

But I just feel so, bitter and jealous, when I see friends who earn so much less, spend so much more, live the high and easy life, because they are born into a rich family. They always tease me for earning so much more than them and yet dressing/eating like their maid or driver. Even those friend who are not rich and earn much less than me laugh at me for acting like them, they think I'm putting on a show of being poor. And worse, some don't believe that what I have accomplished is real. They think it must be from my parents, although they have never given me a cent of money after graduation, only true love and affection and discipline.

I know I'm doing the right thing, I might not be able to sustain this breakneck work pace and income forever. I have aging parents to take care of, and plans to marry the most wonderful girl in my world. But that tight and bitter feeling when my peers show up for supper with a car that they would never be able to afford (monthly cost more than their whole damn salary), go travel the world anytime because they work (or not) in the family business, or even buy into an investment without mulling it over for days because they can afford to lose the money: its a sucky feeling to have. 

I'm not angry at them, just life seems unfair sometimes. . I just wanted to get this off my chest, I know we are not all born equal. BTW I'm not Singaporean, and the only way I made it to NUS was with a full scholarship.

So I was dating this guy for a year before i got together with him that ended in a year. Throughout this period he kept cheating on me and lying. Had bad drinking habits behind my back and even girls/prostitution - found out by all these accidentally + after some FBI searching. So before we broke up, he actually cheated and disappeared. On one hand he kept apologizing and saying he dont wanna lose me. Yet on the other hand he's still out there telling everyone he's single for v long and playing with girls. 
So finally we broke up, and not long later he's attached to this girl, currently studying PMF. And this girl has a mixed vibes & looks of his previous 2 exes. 
We were introduced to each other's family and friends and all, which to me felt like it was good to go (p/s i found out the full truth only towards the end of the rls) but end up the joke's on me.

My parents and I came to a conclusion of 25% of my salary a month, so assuming I get 4k upon graduation, 20% to cpf and 25% to my parents, I only have roughly 2k left i suppose.

647,"Since young, I have always been socially-deemed as unattractive. People always bullied me because I was damn ugly and fat. Also, my love life was literally non-existent, all the girls that I liked never liked me back. Mind you, I was really trying my hardest to get a gf, but to no avail. Due to my image, I had zero self-esteem. I was very depressed and sad most of the time, and I just felt very empty and I just wanted to feel something. 

After army, I got into NUS Biz. I didn't get the chance to apply for FOPs so I had little to no friends in school. I tried signing up for Aphrodite lately but after getting both matches, they immediately ghosted me after seeing my profile picture, why do people always judge me by my looks first...

Last year, however, I met the girl of my dreams. I went for NUS Bizad Charity Run 2019 alone last year. I wanted to motivate myself to be healthier and also hope the I could meet some new people. During the run, I accidentally tripped and fell at the basketball court area. Even though it wasn't that serious, I was pretty shagged out from the run and laid there for a while. Suddenly, this really chio girl who was in the middle of running stopped and approached me, asking if I was okay. I was super shocked because I never thought someone like her would approach me.

She helped me up and kept asking if I was ok. I told her I was fine and that I could continue running and wanted to finish it. She then offered to run the rest of the route together and wahhh I was literally damn happy but tried to look calm. She was wearing a pair of light pink Nike shoes with the blue shirt. And not to be creepy or anything, but she smelt really good too. She was chatty and bubbly throughout the run, and we talked about life in NUS. She was also from Biz. Sadly, the run ended and she really made 5 km seem like 1 km. Even though we talked for a bit, my dumbass couldn't bring myself to ask for her name, and she didn't ask me for mine either. I have never been able to get her out of my head ever since, I really wish I can see her again. 

 I hope that I will be able to find her through NUSWhispers and that she will be reading this. To that girl: I really hope that that you have signed up again for the upcoming BCR 2020. If you haven't I hope you will do it in hopes of being able to run together again. I will definitely be on the lookout for those light pink nike shoes at the starting line at 5pm outside MRB :')

We grew up together and were from the same sch throughout till now in NUS. So it started out in sec sch where we got closer and more comfortable with each other, theres this one cca basketball practice where we showered together and were very open with one another.
We became best of bros and everytime i go to his house we are naked studying in his room??? And he even initiated watching porn together(mind u, he is attached with his gf at that time). So i said ok and we somehow became more than best friends. So despite having a girlfriend, we still help each other mutually as we are bro fap buddies. Fast forward, i now have a girlfriend but she says im not forking out enough time for her?? Half the time shes always complaining that i spend more time with my best friend than her but what m i suppose to do when i alr know him for almost a decade??
My gf ever mentioned that shes opened to the idea of a threesome, im not sure if she will be ok with the idea of a 3some with my best friend, seeing that she gets very jealous of our strong friendship most of the time.
I too, am not very sure if i am alright with some guy penetrating her, i dont really like to share my girlfriend as im very possessive and i dont like the idea of her being used by someone else. Im thinking that maybe he can penetrate me instead? 
Besides these, my best friend is currently single and i dont want him to feel lonely on his own. I am thinking of proposing the idea of a three-person relationship with her, ill probably be more alright with my best friend screwing her if the 3 of us are in a relationship, but this is so uncommon in singapore n im not sure how it will work out.

I'm 2nd year out of university. Salary about 6-7k a month before CPF deduction. I can't BTO on my own. But buying 2nd hand HDB is economically so much less worth it as an investment compared to the private market.

And I'm not even looking to own a car. ANd I'm ignoring inflation of the housing market. 

And that's not even factoring the budget I need for all the cats I want. At this rate I'm going to be flipping 35 years old before I can move out, and 40 years old before I can be a comfortable cat lady. Can't imagine how it feels like to want kids.

I have been dating this girl through university and after (3 years). We spent a lot of good times together, shared similar life goals and drive, and have so much memories together. We also got to meet and know each others' family - loving and caring for them together. Life is such a bliss and I thought she was the one. 

However, everything fell apart five months ago. She started her work and went into society, and we had different schedules, priorities etc. There were also things she didn't like about me, and that I am partly at fault too. Anyway, Love was not strong enough to hold everything together. When 'reality' kicks in, finances, more and better options out there - she was still young and quite a catch, so things ended with us.

I still have feelings for her, and such memories are difficult to let go. I saw her as part of my family. But at the same time, I cannot control what she does or choosing to 'upgrade' to someone else. The pain is excruciating as I've given my all and she was a close one.

I think I've seen a few similarish posts here so I'm writing here for advice too. We've been together for a while, soon to be two years, but I'm starting to take him seriously now and it kind of freaks me out that I don't really trust him and I feel like I should verbalize this to him but I'm not sure how I should do it. By not trusting him, I mean, I feel that he would be the kind of person who would abandon the family in time of need (e.g I get cancer! Our kids have ADHD! Or I lose my jobs ((I'm not working yet, still in uni but he is)). I also feel like he would be the kind of person who would leave the minute we have a major disagreement (everything has been smooth sailing so far, he's very chill and I'm very tolerant). I know it feels unfair to assume the worst of someone but how do I know that he's not going to flake out on me? We've been blessed enough to not be put through any major trials or tribulations but that does make me worry that he's not ""man enough"" to handle them when they inevitably come. 

He has this whole air of ""If you're not happy, leave."" Am I an asshole for feeling that he's not reliable at all?

A part of me feels that marrying a person like that is just asking for trouble even though he's been great in every other aspect so far - yet is asking for reassurance in this area bad? Even if I tell him this, what can he do to prove that he's going to stick around? Or what can I do to reassure myself?

Please help, I'm so stressed about this.

I don’t blame him for that because I do hide things from him as well as I don’t want him to worry about me. But what makes me sad is that he shares almost everything with his friends. Recently he was texting a friend (a girl) while going on a date with me. I peeped at his phone and saw that they were chatting very happily away. This triggered memories of the days when we used to joke with each other before we officially dated- our messages were full of funny things. He used to text me almost daily to ask me about my day. Unlike now- we barely communicate, perhaps only when we meet up. Thus, on the day when I caught him talking to the girl, I suddenly lost my temper with him. The girl whom he has been talking to is also from his major, naturally they will have many common topics. Whenever my bf talks to me about those technical terms from his major, I (from a different major) will just listen without understanding anything. Sometimes I feel neglected and sad but I always put on a happy face in front of him. He is a smart guy- sometimes I feel I’m too stupid for him, and I’m not good enough.  I’m not asking for his attention 24 hours a day, just a word of concern from him each day is enough to light up my day. He is a sweet guy who treats me very well, but I want him to know that all I want is his concern rather than expensive meals and gifts...

How do we know if we are the top 5-10% in our faculty, especially when we only have results from 1 sem? Also, how hard is it to get through the entrance test for the French unis? And for those who got in the programme, what made you decide to go for it? How different are the modules in the French unis compared to NUS (and is it very hard to do math in French)? Thank you in advance for answering my questions.

674,"To people asking for help regarding incompatible sex drives between two parties in a relationships, there is nothing wrong with wanting to have sex with your partner, BUT, the issues arise when it is all about ""what I want"". Before seeking to be understood, did you seek to understand your partner's reasons first? These kinds of issues in a relationships can only be resolved by the involved parties alone. Whether you seek to reach an understanding or leave, it is your choice and no choice is the wrong choice and no one has the right to call you out on your own decision. It doesn't matter if you have known each other for 1 day or 10 years, these concerns can happen and they are all valid concerns. If it is tough to resolve by yourselves you can even go see a sex counselor together.

681,"Recently my boyfriend of two years became an avid pokemon fan. We both share an intellectually similar sense of humor where our laughter thrives on puns, references and inside jokes. In a quest to spice up our bedroom activities, he thought it would he funny to make pokemon puns mid-sex, which honestly kills off the mood for me but I do not wish to ruin his moment. Since he is not in NUS, I'll just openly say it. During one of our recent sessions, foreplay begain with going something along the lines of ""baby, your neh sibei Jigglypuffs, limpeh ready to put my Charmander inside you."" I wasn't a huge fan of it, but nevertheless tuned it out and sex commenced. Here's some context: both me and my boyfriend bring out the best in each other's sexual prowess, we've been trying out karmasutra positions to make things a little more interesting, with my favorite positions including splitting the bamboom, the milk and water embrace etc. to name a few. According to google theres somewhere along 245 to 300 of these positions, and ever since he became an avid Pokemon fan he would begin every session by claiming that ""we gotta catch em' all"" (try all 245 of the positions). We used to play pop music in the background but ever since the Pokemon thing all he does is blast the Pokemon theme sont ON A LOOP, when it comes to the part where it goes ""I will travel across the land, Searching far and wide. Each Pokemon to understand,The power that's inside!"" he points at my nether region and goes down on me, every once in awhile raising his head to ask ""if I had Squirtle"". It's been so frustrating that every session ends with me completing losing every ounce of sexual energy I once had, even though Pokemon means the world to him."" I even suggested a compromise, that perhaps we could go with a less odd animation cartoon to roleplay when under the sheets, particularly Peppa Pig, because we could at worse, oink in bed, and that isn't anywhere half as horrible as Pokemon puns. Still, he did his research, watched an episode of Peppa Pig and during our session, pointed to his little brother before adopting the british Peppa Pig voice and going ""I'm A Wiggly Worm, I'm A Wiggly Worm! How Do You Do? I Love You! I'm A Wiggly Worm! *Snort*"" as a reference to one of the episodes. I just about lost it. I know communication is key and everything so I voiced my concerns to him but he took one last jab at me and used our karmasutra positions as an inside reference to break up with me, telling me that ""If you don't wish to split the bamboo while accepting my Pokemon jokes, then we're splitting up"". I have no idea how to patch things up with him for I do love him dearly but our sex life has been nowhere near fulfilling for the longest time. Tell me, should I change my sheets to a Pokemon themed one and dress myself as Peppa Pig for halloween in an attempt to salvage my relationship? Should we have sex again I'll probably stuff in some ear buds and try to focus on his Charmander going in and out of me I suppose.

She also have curfew had to be back home by latest by 1030pm, by 10 pm she's not home her mum will spam call her. Honestly speaking it sucks to have this curfew thing as both of us stay quite far from each other, 1 at west area and 1 at north-east area. We have alot of restriction due to the curfew such as no late night movie date and no staycation. We are also not allow to travel oversea for holiday as a couple even till now. 
During the courtship period we have arguments due to this issue and sometimes she brokedown and cried. But this doesn't stop us from being together, we tackle this issue together by planning our date to the smallest details and I make it a point to send her home every date/ outing, ensure she reach home before 10pm. Now I think back this continue for 3 years plus untill her parents started to know my existence and how I send her home everytime, even though we dont stay near each other. They started to be lenient by setting the curfew to 11~1130pm and lesser spam calls but I still make it a point to ensure she reach home by 10pm. Now we are engaged and getting married soon. 
Advice to OP relationship is not all sunshine and rainbow, most of the time is thunderstorm and it's not just you love me and I love you. It requires sacrifices, determination and communication from both parties. If you think she's the one for you take this curfew as a challenge, prove to her family curfew is nothing otherwise don’t waste each other time and move on. YOUTH IS PRECIOUS!!!

689,"After breaking up with my ex, it took me almost three years to get over the past. He even got married recently. I thought I would never be able to feel in love again. I'm already 25. 

This semester, I met a guy friend, whom I was friend with two years ago, very randomly in another lecture but we hardly talked. 

One day, I came to the lecture early and I saw him sit alone. So, we just naturally caught up with stuff like what the plan would be after graduation (we are both year 4). Then, he randomly mentioned a book that I liked as well, and I mean, for the guy friends I know, they don't really read books like that. 

Since then, I enjoyed talking to him more and I realized he had a great smile. He made me laugh a lot, and we seemed to have the same interests. Sadly, the semester ended and we would possibly never see each other again. 

You know the feeling when you have a crush on someone and enjoy being with him but at the same time you are afraid he might just treat you as a friend, or when you are so curious to know about his love life but you never dare to ask?
And above all, it's a feeling when you are afraid that you might get hurt once more time.

I just wonder, how much the chance would be to see someone that makes your heart flutter again like that?

690,"*WARNING LONG POST AHEAD* 

This story involves 2 other people. For simplicity, I shall name them:

A - my childhood best friend
B - the love of my life 

I have known A almost my whole life, growing up in the same neighbourhood, going to the same primary, secondary & poly together. We would usually meet up most of the days since we only stayed 5 minutes apart. Be it for movies, meals, playing Basketball, hanging out at the park to talk about life etc. We were basically like siblings. He was blessed with good looks and I would always feel inferior to him. He could easily talk to girls as he was an extrovert, while I was completely the opposite. 

I met B when I was in secondary school, we met by an unusual situation whereby her best friend and my table partner had feelings for each other, so we would try to arrange for ways for them to meet after school. B was the first girl I ever talked to. We would then go on to be “text buddies” throughout our secondary life. I began to develop feelings for her along the way but never managed to express it due to the fear of rejection. She was the one girl I would talk to day & night, sharing our daily experiences with each other. Occasionally going out for movies and meals. We probably could have ended up together if I had a little bit of courage to ask her. (Bear in mind that I am the extreme case of an introvert, so it’s really difficult for me to express my feelings to others.) But I was contented with just being her friend at that point of time.

Time flew and we were eventually in poly, I was still in touch with B but our conversations would shorten due to being out of things to talk about. This is when things would start to get a little complicated. During my poly days, my friendship with A started to deteriorate as he decided to join the MLM craze happening at that time. He would occasionally ask me to join as he claimed that his company had good plans for high returns. My parents always told me to stay away from people like that and I would do so. But 1 day, I decided to just trust the friendship we forged over the years and had a go and invested in 1 of the plans he said was “fool proof”, hoping to get easy cash but just waiting out a couple of months. The time came when he promised me the returns would be delivered but of course, it never did. I decided to let it go by since he also invested in that scam scheme and continued my friendship with him, since he was also in the same boat. But of course, my friendship with him was not as solid as before, as I would decline to meet him as frequently as before. 

Soon after, A contacted B through social media and they started to chat. I was curious as to why A would suddenly want to talk to B, but I didn’t ask him about it cause he told me B was never his type since Secondary days. I decided not to bat an eye cause I wasn’t afraid of A ever liking B, since A knew how much B meant to me. At most, we could all become closer together and hang out even more right? Well, I was stupid to hope it was that case.

Fast forwarding a couple of weeks, A called me one night at asked “Hey if by some reason, I happen to catch feeling for B, will you get angry?” At that exact point I already knew, that he had feelings for her, if not why so would he even ask me that question? I of course responded with “Of course I will, you always knew my feelings towards her right?” He replied with “Yes of course. Alright see you soon.” 

I then saw through social media that they would “flirt” with each other through every tweet or post and began to think that they might actually already be together. But both A & B was reluctant to make it public as they were afraid it would hurt me. 

Following a few days, B suddenly asked me if I wanted to meet up and “catch up on life”. At that point I was sure that they were together and she wanted to break the news to be about them being together. I pretended not to know and proceeded anyway, hoping for a small miracle it wasn’t true and would favour me in some way. 

The day came when all hells would break loose for me. I met her at our usual meeting place and “caught up on life”, laughing and talking about the past incidents and the mutual TV shows we would watch. Towards the end of the meeting, I could sense she was a bit awkward, thinking of ways to break the news of them being together. Hence I just went ahead and decided to tell her, “Hey look, I know you and A are together...” She looked me in the eye for a few seconds, stunned and then proceeds to say, “Yes we are, I hope you understand and accept that. Hope it doesn’t affect our friendships.” 

Hearing those words, which I already knew to begin with, had affected me more that I thought it would. I was boiling with rage inside and in that heat of the moment, I said some terrible stuff like, “You know you aren’t going to last long with him right? He is a player and always plays with feelings. You are never going to be happy with him, and you can tell him that the friendship is over and he can go to hell. All the best to you anyway.” I immediately walked out of the restaurant after saying those words, without hearing what she had to say or what her reaction was, cause I was afraid I was only going to make matters worse if I stayed on. 

Once I reached home, I decided to block them both from all my social media’s since I didn’t even want to see A’s face. 

It was been a good 5 years since that incident. Recently I have been having dreams about B, all happy dreams such as us going out together, talking to each other again. I couldn’t help myself but to want to find a way to talk to B again. I can’t accept losing B in my life cause of actions done by A. Till this day, I regret blocking B and losing her. 

Oh and please note that A and B are not together anymore as I have mutual friends who would update me about B time to time. They broke up in that year they got together. I really miss B a lot, and am desperate to find a way back in her life. But I’m not sure if she will forgive me for what I did/said to her in our last meeting. 

So please, I need some advice on what I should do. Should I just let things be as they are now? If not, what should I do to get B back in my life?

As a result, the house we were staying in got repossessed by some Ang mo creditor. My husband disappeared as well after getting into debt, leaving us to pay off his debts and fend for ourselves.

As my kids and I had nowhere else to go, we begged the creditor to let us stay in our home, and in return we will work hard to pay off the debt with interests.

Despite overwhelming hardship, we not only paid off the debt, we also managed to upgrade our home and made several improvements.

One day, our creditor told us that we have successfully paid off so off all that we owed him, and that he is returning the title deed back to my husband! The house was his all along anyway.

Then, my husband came back into our lives.  Instead of the young foolish man he once was, he had morphed into a very successful and should I also say shrewd businessman. He amassed even more wealth and our house value is like spare change to him.

He came back and wanted to take responsibility for us. However our kids, after being used to not having him around, were apprehensive. He doesn’t stay with us, but beside us in a large bungalow. However off an on, he will pop by, and voice his displeasure if he sees the kids misbehaving, threatening to drag them back to his own house to be punished.

Naturally my kids are very unhappy. But for the life of me, I cannot comprehend why my kids started trashing their own house that they stay in, just to make a statement that they are upset at their dad’s high handed ways! We built the house together without their father, but they make no qualms about destroying the very house that we built! When our servants tried to stop them, my kids beat them up instead!!!

All these while, my husband looks on with bewilderment as well, since his own bungalow is still well and fine! When my mother tried to clean the mess they made, they started jeering at her as well! They said they are doing these things to show their dad they are angry with him, and wants him to pass the title deed back to them!
 
So super no brain. The house was never my kids in the 1st place. They even had the cheek to ask our creditor to come back and claim the house! I just want to spank the lights out of them!!! Unless bunch of brainless buggers. (Must be the dad’s foolish young genes!) Give birth to char Siew is better than giving birth to them!

This is a message from one of your CS1010S students this sem(1). I would just like to say that you are my idol. I have only ever attended one of your physical lectures (the final one when you came to the 10am class) and from then I could see why so many students admire you, due to either your intellect or humorous yet still serious presentation. Besides that, your comments on NUSWhispers is also something that I find hilarious and insightful at the same time.

Albeit the fact that CS1010S was (to me at least) a pretty hellish mod which caused me a lot of trauma and war flashbacks, the way it was delivered was still pretty fun and enjoyable for some reason. Additionally, this mod has helped me forge several close friendships due to the mutual suffering :"") so it is surely an unforgettable mod (and perhaps the best mod this sem?).

Initially, I thought that you were just a savage and killer prof who would roast a student for every mistake they made, but after seeing how you actually advise students on NUSWhispers or in real life regarding anything ranging from school advice to relationship advice, I can see that my first impression was false. So, I would like to just thank you for creating CS1010S, teaching us there, and being you :)

I got to know this girl through playing mobile legends. At that time, i was sourcing for a squad or active players to play rank games together through facebook pages. She's an extrovert, in contrast to me, an introvert so i enjoyed her company alot. She's also very cheerful and very well liked by people around her.

We would meet up often under void decks or malls to play ML together. There were also late nights whereby we will discord and play till early morning. I started to develop feelings for her and I felt like we were already an item. She would report to me where she was going and call me when i am not online on Mobile Legends.

This continued for more than half a year when i finally felt i had the courage to express myself to her. I purposely MIA for the whole day so that she would call me. And, at around 1am, i finally got the call i was waiting for. I picked it up and told her how much i liked her and i wouldn't want to see her with any other guys.

Unlike any other love stories, she just said, i was nothing more than a ML friend that brought her to mythic. And that was how my world fell apart again.

Thank you prof, for hiring such caring TAs. As if they fear we do not ask them questions enough. As quoted by Eldon, ""if you dont know now, please ask. dont be embarassed, what happens in this class stays in this class. But if you dont know how to do in the finals, I cannot help you.""
Thank you prof, for giving us chocolates. So far in my university candidature, you are the first to do this. The hersheys are good :)
Thank you prof, for sending us reminder email on the morning of the exam. Its really heartwarming.
Thank you prof, for coming down row by row minutes before the exam, and wish us good luck. We don't get profs like this all the time.

708,"Hi. writing in to ask for advice. I have a fiance and we have been together for about 5 years now but there is this 1 problem that has been in my mind. I come from a humble family: my father earns about max 2k a month and my mother is a housewife. Before my fiance and I got graduated, our meals will be paid by my parents. For example, when we go to hawker centers, my mother would pass us about $20 to settle our meals. Just a note,  my fiance comes from a well-to-do family and has a lot more allowance than I do. Both of us started working after we graduated and am earning about 4k (me) and 4.5k (him). However, he has never once treated my family a meal before, not even a cup of coffee to my mother. A case that happened recently, when my family decided to go to a hawker center to settle our lunch, he didn't even bring his wallet out and my mother had to pay his $6 meal since they queued up at the same store. It became a habit for him and I do know that this cannot go on like this. He is very generous to him and myself in terms of food but really stingy to other people. Please advise on how I should let him know about this bad habit of his because his stinginess really turns people away from him and it is really difficult to inform him about this.

712,"Sorry for the incoming rant but I have a few questions regarding the online-dating landscape in singapore. For some context, I'm a male NUS student and recently I've been trying out the online-dating apps since it is the holidays. As the matches come in, I observe that singaporean girls that use these apps don't seem to be interested in dating at all. They either lead you into a never ending session of small talk or they do not even intend on meeting anyone in real life. 

In terms of chatting online, most either give uninterested vibes/short replies (even when we are matched) or are somehow blind/unresponsive to my carefully crafted/decent open ended questions (not hard questions at all). When it comes to meeting up in real life, they simply refuse to do so (when the point of dating apps is to arrange a date to not only learn about the other person in real life but to see if there is chemistry).  

While I agree that my view is bias, especially after wasting days of small talk, I feel that I am not understanding something about singaporean girls. Do singaporean girls go on dating-apps to boost their ego or are they simply just a tough nut to crack? What are the usual norms in online dating? In the mean time, the only nut I can crack is my own.

TLDR: How to use online-dating apps?

1.  When are parent-teacher meetings usually conducted? Would it be yearly or once a semester? How do I contact my son’s teachers to get an update on his progress in school? 

2. How are the classes being streamed? Do they put students with good grades in one tutorial class and the ones with the bad grades will be in the last tutorial class? 

3. Are relationships common in NUS? My son has always been enrolled into boys school so I need not worry about that. But I’m scared he’ll find a gf in NUS and I want to avoid that because I think he should only start dating when he graduated from his degree, or hopefully his masters programme. 

4. Every Thursday, my son tells me that he has no school on that day. I find it hard to believe and I think he’s skipping school. 

5. My son has not shown me any of his homework or test marks for my signature. He told me that his courses only have exams and group projects, and do not require my signature. This is ridiculous. How else can i make sure he’s doing his work?

I was able to go home on time everyday, allowing me to take up new courses and learn new skills, whereas my friends who have full time jobs complain about constant OT.

Whenever my contract for my temporary job end, I give myself a week break before finding another job, whereas my colleague have to wait for the next public holiday just to get that extra one day off.

I, however, broke up with my partner of 3 years over several months ago. I understand that I initiated it, and I dated a few people afterwards. I've met people who used me, played me, and being overly desperate beings (too nice to me),  yet still feel like I couldn't find anyone better than my ex. But I didn't wanna patch back because I felt like we were toxic and I became the worst version of me. 

We both had quite a bad temper and low tolerance in general. Whenever one flared, we would ended up quarreling. I don't see myself growing to be a better person in terms of patience. And I really want a patient person who will not flare up over minor things, and will influence me to be more patient as well.  

However, it made me more wary of love, such that I would want to be more understanding towards my next partner, address whatever issues we have as a mature adult, and help each other grow into the best version of ourselves.

I've had some eye candies that I stole a look at when I was in school, but that's about it. I know I will never be as good as others, in terms of looks, body, intelligence and charisma. I know I cannot be on par with others, the straight or the gay. 

This makes me believe I'm destined to be alone forever. Don't get me wrong, it's not that bad. I don't have to worry about other expenses but mine. I don't have to worry about fluctuating emotions or conflicts I see in my attached friends. Yet somehow, I sometimes feel a bit left out. 

When I'm a bit depressed or having a rough day, I thought of confiding to someone, to rant to someone and to tell someone what happened. To my family, sure I can do that, but sometimes they don't get what I'm going through. Parents will tend to compare how tenacious and strong they were in the past and compare themselves to us in an encouraging way, but it sometimes irks me to be compared to a generation not being faced with shifting changes and technological advancements almost everyday. Hard work like how it used to be in the past does not guarantee results already. It's different now and I feel exasperated trying to explain to my family what I am facing.

To friends, sure why not. They are my generation. Once or twice it's ok, but I sometimes get a feeling that they are bored or just disinterested in what I'm saying. They can provide a listening ear, but the lack of connection is still there.

I don't know how it feels go confide to a partner. I've heard many around me that when they have something they want to share, the first person they talk to is almost always their partner. They talk, laugh, cheer each other on. I feel that they are being loved and cherished, romantically of course. I sometimes yearn for this relationship, to find someone in the crowd that understands and cares for me. 

Yet somehow, I know I'm not good enough no matter how hard I try, and it's not just because of my sexual orientation, but because it's just me. Plain old me.

So shout out to everyone who got an interview that try to mask their company name all saying its private and confidential but when they ask you down for interview its at Newton or like Fuji Xerox Tower.. Then you better clarify with them that you're not interested in a financial consultant role before heading down. Did that a few times and the HR just MIA on me. So I guess my instinct was right.

I’m an only child too. Worse still, my dad stayed with his parents and unmarried sibling, and they expect me to be a surrogate child and provide for them.

My grandma has 6 kids and 10 grandchildren, but I’m the only one to bring her for medical appointments. My uncle used to take care of her needs until he fell ill himself. They now expect me to move back to take care of the 5 old folks at home, and bring them to the doctor. 

I had to draw my boundaries clearly and refuse, knowing that all the financial burden and time spent on medical appts (we’re talking about 1-2 appts weekly) would be foisted to me by all the cousins. I don’t understand why dad’s unmarried siblings would expect me to pay and spend most of my annual leave ferrying then to the drs when my cousins drive and are earning so much more(close to or over 5 digits for half the cousins), and they knew I used up all my leave on part time studies. 

Some welfare group has been by and offered them aid too. They rejected and said relatives would help, then promptly called me and demanded that I buy or rent the required items for them. Not sure if its their pride, but I sure wish they would distribute the burden out more evenly. They would tell me there is nobody else, but when I insisted on not having any leave, they managed to find another cousin who brought him to the doctor.

724,"Sorry in adv for the long post but I needed to get this off my chest and I’m scared my friends will judge me if I tell them.

Ive been with my ex-boyf, let’s call him G, since the start of Y1. We study diff subjects but I always made time to spend with him no matter how busy I got during lunch or wtv (I’m from a fac where the schedule is very hectic). In return he would always buy me food and pay for stuff. We applied for overseas exchange tgt and we got our same first choice of uni (in europe), and we made alot of plans to go travelling and stuff.

Truth is that as soon as I got accepted I started thinking of reasons to dump him. I just really wanted a angmoh boyf. I know it sounds bad but it’s like, G already got to have me to himself for 2 years and I was very loyal to him the whole time. I never even looked at any other guy and never went out with guys alone. I only get the chance to go on exchange once in my life and I didnt want to be burdened with something I chose in Y1, especially since it was so long ago.

So 1 week before we flew over (we bought tickets tgt) I changed my flight to an earlier one and broke up with G. I tried to be nice and I even had sex with him one last time before I left his place. Afterward he kept trying to text me and beg me to patch back but I didnt reply him.

Fast forward a week and I was settling in at the uni (not going to say which one incase people guess who I am) and I met this really hot angmoh, let’s call him B. B had short blonde hair and blue eyes like the waters of Bali. He was also taller than G (at least 180cm – I’m only 167 and G was 172) and had a very muscular chest and shoulders. When I first saw him I was like omgggggggg I literally died and came back to life and died again!!

He started talking to me on the first day of lectures and we instantly hit it off. He was so funny, and he understood me so well. It was perfect. When he asked me to hang out outside of class I immediately jumped at the chance! One day we went back to my room and started making out. I felt this attraction Ive never felt with G or any other SG guy before. After a few days we had sex for the first time. I was so shocked because I had never gone to homerun with anyone so fast before but we had this amazing connection, but it felt so right. I have always been a feminist and I wanted to be more sex-positive. I came from a very traditional background and my parents always wanted me to save myself. In the end I wanted to prove that this is my body, so I did a lot of ‘dirty’ things with B that I never even thought about doing with G.

As time went on I started seeing B less and less, and when we met it was always me going over to his house for sex. Sometimes he didnt use protection and just pulled out. I started getting angry with him and demanded to know where he was but he would start ignoring me. I didnt want to admit to myself that he was just using me, so I tried using the same tactics I used on G when we were together.

Soon B started avoiding me and in my sadness I messaged G again, thinking he would be desperate to get back tgt with me (he used to talk about BTO and kids so often it really freaked me out). When he didnt reply my repeated messages I stalked his insta and found out he got a angmoh girlf! They post all these gross couple workout videos and seeing him with her made me feel sick. I dont even know why she would be with him. He’s slightly shorter than her and his dick isn’t that big (I should know). And its not my fault that I wanted to try something new. G was so boring and he cant compete with B’s looks. I didnt even think angmohs would be interested in SG guys (she’s really very pretty).

Should I confront her for stealing him, even though I know that I broke up with him first? I’m really very conflicted and I feel so stupid and used. When I first saw their photos I let my anger get the better of me and I messaged G’s parents telling them that he dumped me for some angmoh slut. He didnt tell them about us so they got very angry and scolded him (they’re also very traditional). He messaged me yst and said that not just was he never going to talk to me again, but he never wanted to date a singaporean girl ever again because ‘european girls are so much better in every way’. I now know I was wrong, but I dont know what to do to fix it and I still want G back.

Just recently I realised that I crave emotional connection with females but physical connection with males. I've been struggling with this a lot. Tried to date guys but they're either boring or stuck up or insensitive, which is a huge turn off. Or maybe it's just me.

I think I'm starting to like one of my female friends romantically. I don't think of her very often but when I do, I can't get her out of my mind. She's definitely not straight bc she's openly ace/pan. I can't stop thinking about this because my parents are huge homophobes and will kick me out of the house and disown me if I were to date a girl but even though everything in me is screaming about how wrong this is, my heart is saying it's right and idk if I should act on this.

727,"As a fresh graduate (I ended school this semester), I received my SMS result with apathy yesterday. My CAP was firmly in first-class range since the previous semester, and taking fewer modules this semester means that only in stress-cases (multiple Bs and below) could my honors class drop. 

For context, I secured my job in September, having interviewed in August, and since then school for me has just been running through the motions. I never put in a shift in project work nor did I fight for class participation as I have done previously, never bothered or interested in my modules - after all, they were unrelated to my job. 

As expected, the results confirmed my honours class. I felt a distinct sense of emptiness. What have I been fighting for all these time. Jobs? Nah, most employers only need minimum second class uppers. To the juniors worrying about their CAP in your junior years, my advice is to chill out and immerse your self in personal growth, learning and employment experiences that are relevant to you because these are what employers will query in the interview. 

Yes, it is possible to increase your CAP, and it is normal to start off poorly, given the noise you face as a freshman in the first year and you are still finding direction and footing in school. I pulled up my CAP from a floor of 4.17 in my first semester to secure first class, but it does require some commitment and tenacity

734,"Seeking for honest opinions. Sorry, it will be a very long story. No trolls please.
I'm average-looking and I’m currently going out with a guy that’s 7 years older than me and is a working adult. He is attractive, smart, modest, humorous, has a well-paying job, very popular and most important of all, he has a good personality. I have some mutual friends that that has told me that he always tries his best to keep a distance from girls that approaches him as well.

We really love each other and always make consistent effort to try our best to spend time with each other, with him working around with his hectic working life and with me managing my examinations, projects, etc. He treats me very well, understands me, and is always the first to notice if I’m in a sour mood after going through a bad day. Occasionally we do have our quarrels and fights due to our differences, but we managed to resolve it and stick together despite it all, accepting the other for who we are. In overall, we are together with each other for a good 1.5 years.

I know all of this sounds too good to be true, and all this while I'm trying my best to improve myself to be better - be it in terms of working on my appearance, personality, learning new skills, etc. so that I would be able to better match up with him.

But here's the catch – at the beginning of the relationship, my family knows about it and objects to him, saying that he's too good for me and that he's not taking me seriously, as well as saying about some other really nasty stuff about him without knowing him all that well, which was not really fair to him. Of course, knowing that it definitely wasn't true, I tried to speak up for him, but they said that I was very blinded by him and that I should really face reality and wake up, why would someone of such a good calibre want me. 

I discussed about this with him and it landed a really huge blow to him, as he's really very concerned about the opinions of the people around me and he was depressed for quite a long period of time. He was really understanding and understands that my family just wanted the best for me and that it was normal for parents to be protective of their child, but was still very hurt from their comments nonetheless. He told me that it’s okay and I should not worry my family, let them think that we have broken off, and keep our relationship from my family for the time being and we will figure out a way to solve this somehow eventually. I tried to talk to him, cheer him up, but to no avail. We continued sticking together and after a few months, he went back to his normal cheerful self. My family still suspects me going out with him from time to time and was quite unhappy, but kept silent about it, only occasionally dropping hints here and there and prompted me about it.

He was very depressed to the point where his family noticed the changes in him, and was really concerned about him. After asking him about it and knowing about my family’s objections and hurtful remarks, his family, who had really liked me at the start, started hating on me with the same intensity of how much they had liked me previously. They were really angered by my family’s unjustified comments about their son. I only knew about later on where he kept me knowing about this all this while and only briefly told me that his family knows about this matter a year later. However, he did not tell me that his family hated me because he was afraid that I would be hurt. It was only then afterwards where I found out from my mutual friends about they hated me.

His family knows that we are still together and although they disagree to it, they still respected my S/O’s opinion and did not say anything much about us. However, recently, his family has started rushing him for marriage and asked when would he be able to bring a good partner home, to which, he replied to them jokingly to give him a year and he would find one girl to bring home (cause he’s in his late 20s, they are worried, and I think, they really object to us being together, hence asking those). He did not tell me about this because he was scared that I would overthink, it was from the mutual friend where I found out about this.  

Honestly, I don't know what to do anymore. I’m having thoughts where I think I’m keeping him from finding his right one, but still, I really don’t want to leave him. I’m not telling him about this because I do not want him to worry about me. I’m very confused. What are your opinions on this?

All was going well, until my recent ex boyfriend came to singapore for work, my ex used to work in singapore but then for some reason his company decided that he go back to france to work, so i had no choice but to break up with him. My ex is very good looking, one of the most handsome guy ive dated, and my current boyfriend is not as good looking, but he's loyal, and very intelligent especially in his field, banking and finance. To cut the long story short, i slept with my ex, and i told my ex that i really like him. He knows it. And tbh my heart still wants my ex back, but if it wasnt for the long distance SG - Paris, we would've been together i guess. As for my bf, eventhough he's not living in singapore, atleast he can come here anytime. I feel so lost right now.

737,"My boyfriend and i have been in a stable relationship for two years, recently he entered the same university as me (i am year 3, he’s a year one), and is close to many girls in his hall. Not that i have a problem with that but i found out that he discusses our sex life with one of his girl friends. Recently, i scrolled through his dms (we have access to each other’s acc since forever), and i found out that that girl friend of his sent him a post of a girl covered in hickies. He then replied “just saw, wtf insane sia”

Not sure if this is already a red light in the relationship? She sends him girls who show cleavage and ass as well(she shows a lot of cleavage).. when confronted, he denies and says that they’re only friends. The horny sending of posts continues till today. They also send each other explicit sex position stickers on telegram.. To make matters worse, 5 months ago, I decided to stop having sex with him because i wanted our relationship to be build on passion before anything sexual. He talks about her all the time like how he’s worried for her studies and how she spends a lot of time clubbing and going on dating apps. But when i do badly for a test, he doesn’t even express concern.

Is this because we are already too comfortable with each other? I trust him but i think sending explicit post on instagram to his girl friend is ridiculous. He also does not see the logic behind where I’m coming from. Not sure if it is because he needed to satisfy his sexual needs that I no longer provide? Isit normal for a taken guy to send explicit things to his close girl friend?

Then at the bench rack I saw this average looking guy with weightlifting shoes, and I was amazed by the amount of weight on the bar given his physique and size. I asked if we could share and he looked at me for awhile before grunting and nodding impatiently. As I was removing the plates I felt a bit embarrassed but it was my usual routine so I didn’t want to start my workout with other exercises. When it was his turn I helped him to put all the plates back in, which was super heavy for me, as he was putting the plates he was quite disgruntled and kept mumbling impatiently. I felt paiseh at that moment. 

And then, He. Started. Quarter. Repping. Moving like less than an inch. Afterwards slamming the bar back onto the rack. 

On one hand, I was relieved that I wasn’t hindering a serious lifter’s progress. On the other hand, why did he behave in such a rude manner when he was not a pro from the start? Most people at the school gym that I’ve seen are rather humble.

I have been with my gf for abit over a year now. We recently broke up 2 months back over some petty argument, but it was a clean and mutual break, which I didn't feel really bad about as I felt that the r/s is already nearing its end. However, less than a week she came back begging me to stay and she said she regretted breaking up and that she just kept crying and she can't live without me, so I got back with her to give it another shot. 

Within these 2 months, I really tried my best to be a good boyfriend and to spend time with her, we even had plans to go overseas during this winter holiday break (she's not from NUS tho). But right now, in the midst of exams, I'm wondering if i really did the right thing by staying because I really don't feel that I love her anymore, and by staying I just feel that I'm cheating her of her feelings. And I really don't foresee a future with her in this country due to her family background and problems, mainly money wise.

What's even more fxxked up is that I've actually fallen for another girl, she really reminded me of my gf when I first met her, but she's cuter, smarter and definitely better-looking. She's has those attribute that I want to find in a gf/future wife. Tbh, I never thought that I would be in this position where I would fall for another girl while I am still in a r/s (this is my first r/s actually), and I’ve always thought “why would people cheat?”. But right now for me, I just don’t feel attracted to my gf anymore, and I would prefer to be single right now so that I can chase this new girl. (I don’t believe in dating more than 1 person at the same time)

So that’s my situation, please give me some advice on what I should do… I know somethings just aren’t meant to be in life, but I would feel bad either ways, if I break up or if I stay.

This girl and I met during camp. She had a bf then, but we still texted and met quite often. One day, I confessed to her and she broke down. She felt happier with me and had feelings for me. But what was holding her back from her ex was time(they were together for 2years). To be honest, I was prepared to leave because I dont want to be a third party. 
For the next 2 months, we spent almost every day together(except Saturday and Sunday). The time we spent together, we did share intimate moments(kiss, hugs etc). When she was sick, I would buy medication for her. I would also often buy her favourite food etc. Even when we eat out, I would often pay for our meal. During these 9 weeks, she eventually broke up with her bf. 
So, after 1 weekend, everything changed. Her replies got slower(this was not the same week she broke up with her bf). We had a lot of quarrels about texting etc. She didn’t care as much. There were a lot of red flags, but I chose to believe what she told me. Another week past and I went to find her (she stays in school). The usual bought her favourite food etc, hoping to surprise her. I was in her room for about 40minutes (which she knew cause I texted her) before she came back from her friend’s room. I confronted her about the whole situation and if she liked someone else. After much hesitation, she said yes. My heart sank.  
Till now, I still cannot comprehend the situation. How can someone change of heart so fast? After all the vulnerable moments we shared together. She barely knew the guy, but she already chose to forget everything that happened? I had so many plans; her birthday, after exams etc. But I guess it’s all a waste now. 
I know that time will heal everything but as of now, thoughts of suicidal are constantly in my mind, especially since I know she is enjoying her time with him. After everything that happened, I just feel like I was being used. I tried distracting myself by studying but I cant concentrate. I often skip meals these days cause I just don’t have the appetite. Sometimes I feel like being the nice guy doesn’t get you girls.

The mentality that legislation will solve all our issues is a stupid one, but also a very Singaporean one. It has always been like this - don't like something? Ban it! Singapore claims that it wants to be green, sustainable, and forward-thinking, but yet thinks that banning the cleanest form of last-mile transport is a better option than making up for the lack of dedicated cycling paths, or the lack of enforcement of errant riding behaviors.

I bet the ban will be lifted as soon as LTA figures out a way to enforce the purchase of COE for these vehicles and start installing ERP gantries on sidewalks.

750,"Background

Family: Well to do, can say it’s above average

Sister: Just started her 4 year degree in NUS 

Me: Graduated and just started working 

So just last year when my sister knew she will be enrolling into NUS, she begged my dad to buy her a car as NUS is far from home and driving to school will buy her more time to rest and study. It will take her around 1.5 hours to travel by public transport. 

During my enrollment period, my dad also insist on buying me a car but I didn’t kind of like the idea of it as driving in Singapore is not cheap. Petrol, parking, ERP, maintenance, traffic jam, etc... Do note that my dad is an expert and very knowledgeable about cars. So my dad and I had quite a discussion over this matter and I told him if he insist on buying a car, get something economy as I won’t be driving it often (depreciation and stuff like that...) End of the day my dad bought me an Audi R8... I was so furious that I told him off and had quite a big quarrel over it. After that I told him I’ll cover the monthly expenses of the car. Note that I own a small business while I was in Uni so forking out for the car is still within my capabilities. Till today I did not take a single cent from my dad with regards to car expenses. Technically because I don’t drive it often as it attracts too much attention and I don’t want my friends to know I own such an expensive car...

So back to my sister who eventually got my dad to buy her a Range Rover Velar. She have been driving around for 3 months and often borrows my car. I have friends who are still in NUS and told me that my sister would drive my car to school and park it over the weekend for school camps... Is it necessary to pay parking which can amount to who knows how much???

So recently she told my dad that her car is costly to up keep every month and her car consumes lots of petrol and hope my dad could trade in her car for a smaller one. Guess what, my dad told me that she is requesting for a BMW i8 because it’s an electric car... and her main reason is she would want to help my dad save some petrol money... 

Upon hearing that I confronted her with my dad being around and told her the best way to save money is to 

1. Stay in the hall. With that she will be able to get more rest and not worry about travelling time. Then she mentioned she want to be home daily so I suggested her 
2. Buying the train and bus hybrid concession pass which would cost only $85 which was my main source of transport during my Uni days. Upon hearing that threw a tantrum and said that I’m not understanding enough. Take note that my dad is paying for her petrol and parking expenses which amount to approximately $1200 every month...

I feel that a car to her is to flaunt and not as a transport... Since young she doesn’t work part time or have any source of income and only ask my dad for allowance and fund her travelling and hobbies... Am I being unreasonable here? Why can’t she be more understanding and be like any other student who travel to school by public transport/ stay in the hall? Why can’t she spend her own money? Thoughts on this?

751,"Disclaimer: this is a post purely to rant 

So my colleagues were having lunch and they were essentially complaining that they were broke and how our salaries are too low etc. 
One of them spend like 2k on ordering supper. 
Which got me thinking. I grew up in a family that was quite frugal, so pardon me if I sound misery. But recently even when my friends meet up they complain about not being able to save 
But if you want to spend 2k on ordering supper (which is not a basic need) then are you really blaming your pay for not sustaining this lifestyle?

I mean I tried calculating my own expenses per month
700 allowance to parents 
I eat breakfast and dinner at home - lunch my workplace has hawker centre and food court, so 5bucks per day usually, 20 buck once or twice a week, 300 a month for working 5 days a week
I don't drink bubbletea or coffee or tea because i like water
phone bills- 20 a month 
electricity and water - living with parents 
CLothes- maybe 50 a month
transport- lucky to live near work so 2bucks a day, 50-60 bucks a month
movies- 20bucks a month
eating out on weekends- assuming I eat out 2 times a month (becuase my work is usually too busy and I like to nua at home) it's 80 per month

In total: 700 allowance +300 food + 50bucks transport + clothes 50bucks +100 per month for entertainment = 1200 bucks a month

Assuming average fresh grad pay of 4-5k a month, I really fail to see why people are living month by month? even saving 2k shouldn't be too hard. And a lot of my friends aren't even giving their parents allowance lei. And I'm not even counting performance bonuses and overtime pay, which should be another 5k per year at least (year end bonus should have 13th month for most companies right?) 
Holidays are also technically a want but assuming we put 5k a year aside to travel, it still shouldn't be as abysmal as they say.
Of course I am blessed- I don't have a family to feed, my student loans are paid off during my schooling years. But most of my friends are also not married yet and their student loans are also paid by parents? (based on what they tell me) 
Am I not enjoying life enough? Becuase I don't count owning a car into the picture- but I really feel in singapore car is more of a want than a need? Or is it just a singaporean thing when we like to spend on a lot of wants and call it necessities? I love food too but I think 2k on supper is like... are you eating gold?

Starting of the relationship was sweet as any couples were, but recently he started to stop meeting me claiming that he was tired because of work. I understand that the life of a working adult was never easy so I just spent a significant amount of time alone. Recently he has gotten worse where we only met once for a whole month and he claimed that he needed more alone time. I was feeling quite stressed over school and projects and wanted to talk to him about it but he told me not to add on to his stress. 

I know in life it’s not all sugar for love but he does not seem to be making an effort to stay in my life any further. I try to reach out to him to know what he is thinking but he just closed himself up, leaving me confused. When I confront him if he still wanted to be together he would deem me as insecure and trying to stir things up when everything is going okay. I started to question myself if requesting for him to meet me once every two weeks is too much?

763,"Just want to seek out some relationship advice here because I am afraid of messing up. Here goes.

I am currently a full-time student due to graduate within a year. I met my current (China) girlfriend 7 months ago and we have our ups and downs. We do enjoy each other's company and she seems to love me a lot.While I am her first boyfriend, she is not my first. She confessed to me after a few dates and we have been together since. The thing is, as much as I feel the need to care for her and look after her wellbeing, I do not feel a strong feeling of love to her nor anyone else, including my parents. I also do not feel strong emotions such as sadness. Is there such thing as being devoid of emotion ? I have been hurt deeply by a past relationship before, wondering if that could be the catalyst for the void? I tend to be very straightforward and tend not to be mindful of her feelings at times. However, I do apologise to her when I am in the wrong and attempt to make up for it by coaxing her with food. We also have different values but we try not to force them on each other. I see a future with her but I am afraid that the lack of 'love' for her may ruin everything.

1. I do want to be with her and spend my life with her but will such issues cause future problems between us, breaking the relationship?

We have quarrelled before such as why do I not do romantic things for her, post our pictures on social media (I have introduced her to my circle of friends and family), and a few other things along the lines of romanticism. Our sex life isn't that great because we do not engage in foreplay as she dislikes it. However, she frequently tries to initiate sex. 

2. Will this mismatch between us (love / sex life) cause problems in the future even though we are enjoying each other's company now?

She graduated recently and have started looking for a job. She intends to stay here with me but if she is unable to find a job here, she will return home. However, she does not believe in LDR and would rather that we break up if that becomes reality. I have assured her that even if we are in a LDR, we can make it work (video calls, travelling etc). The outlook doesn't seem optimistic to us, but I do not want the relationship to break apart because of uncontrollable factors.

3. Should I give up my 'freedom' to be with her in China or is there another way out?


Thank you for posting and reading this post. Any advice is greatly appreciated.


TLDR: Currently in a relationship but several problems may break the relationship. Need help.

766,"How do I deal with feeling that I'm never good enough?

I've always have this feeling that I'm underperforming, not good enough etc, even if the facts/my peers are telling me otherwise.

My peers are always telling me 
""Take a break, you've worked hard enough today.""
""You don't have to work constantly.""
""Rest, no need to be so stressed.""

But I just can't sit still when there's incomplete stuff to be done. I used to panic a lot before I submit my assignments, always paranoid that I might have made a huge mistake somewhere. 

It's not that I don't get validation for my work. I never scored less than a B+ for my tests and assignments. I have consistently maintained a 4.2-ish CAP for the past 4 years. During my internships, my coworkers and superiors have praised my work. But the thing is that I have somehow unintentionally conditioned myself to tune out these compliments/positive feedback. No matter how many times I receive the validation, it never ""calms"" me. I always feel like I'm not performing up to standards/expectations. I always feel like I'm below average. I can never list down my strengths and achievements easily, but have not problem listing down entire pages of my weaknesses and past mistakes. 

Right now, I have graduated. While attending a job interview a couple of weeks ago, the interviewers asked me to elaborate on my strengths, and I got totally stumped. Did manage to cook up something eventually, but I don't remember what I said, only that it wasn't completely coherent. To my surprise, I actually got the offer. Now that I'm 2 weeks into my first job, the paranoia is really driving me nuts. I am constantly worried about underperforming, and is seriously questioning why I got hired in the first place.  Even though it's not showing yet, I feel that it'll affect my performance in the long run.

This thing is hurting my interpersonal and romantic relationships as well. I was really close to this girl about a year back, and I'm very certain there's mutual attraction, and she's only waiting for me to pop the question/take action. However, at some point I started questioning what she saw in me, and feeling I'm not good enough for her. I started avoiding her even though she showed consistent concern and affection. Eventually I ghosted her and y'all can guess the rest.

How should I manage this paranoia? How do I effectively tell myself: ""Chill the fk out, you're doing fine.""? It's really driving me insane.

769,"I'm a year 3, F, NUS student. I would say that I'm an introvert who doesn't talk much with people I'm not close to. In recent years, I feel like I have less and less friends for some reason... Every holiday (like now), I'll stay at home and watch my kpop stuff most of the time. As my family doesn't travel overseas for holiday, I can only holiday in SG. The sad thing is that I can't seem to find any friends to go out with during this period. In the past, my younger brother would go out and play with me but now that he's older, he doesn't want to do that anymore. So I just hide in my room and be sad :< In NUS I have some friends to talk with, go for lecture and stuff but they don't tend to hang out with me too. 

tdlr: Why does no one want to hang out with me? Is it cuz I'm too boring or wut?

770,"Here is my take on relationships for guys. I’m no love guru or anything but just try it and it’ll work.
Part of it is psychology, really.

1. Attraction is not a choice. The very first time you see and talk to her, you’ll know if you’re interested in her and vice versa. She’ll know if she’s interested in you. If you’re interested but she’s not, there’s nothing much you can do. Attraction can’t be forced. 
2.  Get straight to the point and be confident. Ask her out for a date. Don’t just text back and forth. What you want is a relationship, not a phoneship. When she asks what do you want to eat, pick a date, time and place. Don’t reply “Oh I don’t know, what do you like to eat?” She wants you to decide. So be direct and decisive. Never accept a “maybe” date. If she says maybe, tell her to figure out her schedule and get back to you. Don’t ask her a second time. She’ll contact you if she’s interested.  
3. Ask questions and build rapport. It shows that you’re interested in her, and she’ll know. Women are not dumb. They’ll know if you like them or not. Asking questions will let her know that you’re genuinely interested in her or not.  
4. After the first date, don’t ask her out for the next date straight away. To them, it shows that you’re needy and you got no options. Contact her maybe 3 days later and ask her out again. You may want to go out minimum once a week. Indirectly telling her you have things going on other than being crazy. (It’s psychology). 
5. Don’t text her often. Honestly, this is the most common mistake. Many guys go on texting through night and day, calling her on the phone and chatting for hours. Again, it’s a relationship you want, not a phoneship. Reply to her texts minimally and set a date. If she texts you, initiate a date. She won’t miss you if you keep blowing up her phone with texts and calls. How can you miss someone if they’re constantly in your face? Again, it’s psychology. 
6. When do you tell your feelings for her or know that she’s interested in you? Listen to her. There are signs. If she “accidentally” bumps into you, it means she’s feeling comfortable with you and doesn’t mind getting closer to you.  But just don’t say “I love you” first. Let her say it. And then you reciprocate.  
7. When is the best time to ask her for an official relationship? Well, look for signs again. She’ll ask, “Where is this going?”. Well, don’t answer by saying “Oh you want a relationship?” Ask her back. Ask her, “ what do you mean ?” And then she’ll elaborate further. Again, ask her questions. Let her elaborate further. She might go along the lines with “We’ve been going out for awhile and I’m just wondering what’s our status.”  Then you’ll know what’s up. 
8. Don’t ask her about her past relationships. Whatever happened in her life doesn’t concern you. She’s going out with you and that’s it. When you ask about her past relationships or ask if she like someone else, you’re telling her you got no value. “Oh, you dated someone better than me? I hope I meet your standards, etc.”  
9. Don’t go telling her about your life story. Always ask her questions. Women like men who are mysterious. It’s like watching a movie and there’s a cliffhanger. They like the anticipation and finding out what you’re all about. If you tell her your whole life story, there’s nothing much for her to discover. 
10. If there are times that she doesn’t reply to you as frequently as before, it tells me that you’re constantly chasing her. I can’t stress this enough, women are like cats. They come and go as they please. If you’re constantly texting her, she’ll get bored. Stop texting her. If she likes you, she’ll come back.  
11. Never argue with a woman. There’s a reason why people say “Women are always right.” When you argue with a woman, it means you don’t understand them. Don’t even bother to reason with them.  
12. Women will ALWAYS test you. ALWAYS. From the the courtship to the relationship phase. Trust me, even if they say they don’t, they do. They’ll purposely make you mad to see if you get mad. Or whatever means to tick you off. Even not replying you for awhile just to see if you’re needy. But that’s just women. Don’t ever get mad. Just play it cool and don’t take things personally. 
13. When she’s mad. She’ll test you. When you ask her to talk , she’ll say “No, I don’t wanna talk about it. I’m not angry at all. There’s no point in talking.” It’s her way of testing if you truly care about her. Dig in deeper, make her laugh. Always use humour. Joke and banter with her till you she says why.  Don’t bother reasoning out with her why she’s wrong during this phase. Just make her laugh and she’ll feel way better. 
14.  Reference to step 13. Be wary of women who stonewall you. These are the people with attitude and are red flags. Whatever ways you tried to joke with her and make her talk but she still refuses to talk. It’s a huge red flag. Imo, they are manipulative as hell.  
15. Once you guys are together, then you can slowly tell her your life story. But do it with a positive spin to it. Example, sharing with her about your past girlfriend,” Oh i broke up with her because she was a egoistic, manipulative, self-centred bitch.” It’ll come as a turn off. Do it with a positive spin for example, “It was pretty unfortunate but I’ve learnt a lot during the past relationship. We just weren’t compatible.” Simple as that :) 
16. Don’t go around pleasing a woman. Please. Don’t drop what you’re doing just to please her. If she’s mad with you for not returning texts immediately and start doing it, trust me, she’ll stop returning your texts after awhile. Have a backbone. Continue with your purpose. Having a purpose is what attracts them actually.  This is as much as I can think of for now. Final tip, don’t chase women. Have them chase you. You just have to chase them during the first 3 dates. Initiate texts and asking out for dates. After that, she’ll text you, wondering if you’re interested in her, and then you can ask her out on a date.  Those romantic films you watch, where you gotta buy her flowers, do all the romantic things and hope one day she’ll fall in love. They don’t work in real life. Never buy her gifts unless she’s your girlfriend.  You don’t see men like James Bond chasing women with flowers etc. Be confident, maintain eye contact and engage in a genuine conversation. Get to know her more. Most part of it is just psychology. That’s why most women go after “ bad boys “ and not the “ nice guys “. This is it. If there are 9 men chasing her with flowers and you just act cool with the tips, she’ll probably blow the other 9 guys off. Many women will disagree on this but this what they’re naturally attracted to. Good luck ;)

I can 100% guarantee you that if I was a female and said guys were staring at me, you guys would not be saying the shit y’all commented. 

My issue is a sense of social etiquette, nothing else, but now I see something else. WOULD YOU like to get stared at ? Probably not. Tell me lah honestly, would you be ok getting stared at ? Especially the girls in the comments trying to poke fun. When, y’all girls get stared at, y’all immediately will say stuff like how the guy staring at you is a creep. So girls cannot be creeps meh ? Same thing like how people say men cannot be victims of sexual assault simply because they’re a man. 

Somebody did say I have anger management issues, yes I do and I’m trying to work on that, but I usually don’t get angry, I just get worked up and agitated easily under stressful conditions (like how I mentioned I had some issues going on, but of course no one noticed) 

As for my last paragraph in my previous post. That post clearly showed how a lot of people put on a mask about our values. If a girl mentioned these same things I said, people would be willing to show support, but if a guy says so, no one gives a damn. Way to go. Same thing like, if a girl is feeling depressed // feeling down, they are more likely to get support but when a guy says the same thing, what do we do ? We tell the guy to man up. Mental health people yay ????????????????????????

Hypocrites. Clearly shows how feminism is NOT equality. This is the reality.

772,"In modern days, majority of the people always enjoy what they are doing as they have the similar kind of feelings towards each other, be it songs, things, attitude, behavior etc. But what about the people who do things differently? These are the people who are labelled as weird, odd, negative, stupid, eye-sickening etc. Take myself as an example. 

I am a 19 years old guy, which falls under the “weird/minority” category. People rarely wants to make friends with me as I do not fall under the “majority” standards. Most of them treats me as the odd one out, a fellow where stuff that I do naturally is under bad and aggressive in their eyes. This is just one of the few reasons, there is a lot more which I am not going to list it down. 

Life is unfair for those that are categorized under “weird/minority” category. Majority of the people will strike us down if we wanted to do something like playing a heavy metal playlist. Most of them will just turn off your music and listen to theirs instead, but you have no choice but to give in to them just because that they fall under the majority category. Sometimes I wonder, why can’t the majority give in to the minority and let them do what they want for a few times. It might be good. Sometimes even majority can be bad, but they will just set it a side and if the same situation goes for the minorities, they get blamed, abused, ignored, laughed at. 

Let’s have a scenario. I was in a party of 12, they were playing music loudly. Initially a song of Nirvana came out, I told them not to skip it as I love these kinds of songs and it’s rare to hear it in a party too, Majority of them were like “stupid kind of taste, loud and aggressive music is bad, shit music”. And they just skipped the song and put up their own Electronic kinds of songs. Sadly, I couldn’t do anything about it because I’m always in the minority side of life. After the incident, I felt really left out and decided to go to a corner to enter my own world of fantasy as I know that no one is going to enjoy the stuff that I’m enjoying. Majority of them were really hyped and delighted with their music where as it is the opposite for me.

Sometimes we as the minority will feel that no one can understand us, hence this is where mental health starts to crumble. Depression and Anxiety will start to kick in. All we want is to be acknowledged by majority of the people, where people can acknowledge us and without being judged. For those who fall into the same category as me, which is under the minority, life is unfair for us, am I right? 

Of course, being treated this way improves our survival mental thinking, we are more independent than the majority as we minorities will feel ominous most of the time, hence building a wall and keeping everything to ourselves. Also, minority tend to be kinder as they must always give in to the majority and we are probably used to it, but kindness would have to draw a limit too to balance it out, if not, we are taken advantaged of basically.

For those who feel that you guys fall under minorities, you guys are real strong, I know that it will be tiring but we would have to fight on. And for the majorities, please give in to us sometimes. Would appreciate it a lot.

""Yes yes, I did notice that!"" replied the student. 

""Then look at the bamboo trees over there,"" said the professor. ""Did you notice that in your first year, they were just small shoots?""

""For the first four years, they hardly grew. Then during your fifth year, they suddenly sprung up to fifty feet high. Did you notice all of that?""

780,"Have you ever felt that life is one big prisoners' dilemma?

If you think about it, the rat race in school, and later on in life, is driven by the prisoners' dilemma. We assume that everyone works hard, so we have to work hard too. But if talent or intelligence is normally distributed, then whether or not everyone studies 10 hours a day, or not study at all, one should expect that the relative standing of the outcome to be the same. This simply means that we are always choosing the less optimal outcome as a society - driven by the fear that someone out there is working harder than us - thus we have to work hard too. The consequence is that while acting in our self-interest, we all end up a lot more miserable.

Perhaps some may argue that the above situation reflect the much proclaimed 'meritocracy' that we have. But let me give you a more concrete example.

Recently, I was offered a highly coveted internship, but it involves crazy long hours. For ease of calculations, let's say the monthly remuneration is $10,000, but it requires working 90 hours a week. Logically, all the company has to do is to hire one additional person to split the work. Two people would end up working a very reasonable 45 hours a week, while receiving $5,000 each. Still great. And on a per hour basis, it's still the same rate. 

But then again, this is a classic prisoners' dilemma problem. From the company's perspective, lowering the salary may deter the 'talented' (debatable) candidates form applying. Additionally, there is always someone willing to work longer hours. Therefore, in pursuit of an ever higher paying job, we are choosing the less optimal outcome, by giving companies the leverage to implicitly demand that we work longer hours. The outcome is that collectively as a society, we lose out by sacrificing our quality of life, even though we may be better off financially.

P.S. I didn't take the job.

To OP's bf (not sure if you will read this post) / to interracial couples who face the same issue :

You need to figure out what you really want at the end of the day. If you want to be her life partner, fight for it then. Sometimes you need to learn to compromise in life, in exchange for lifetime happiness. 

If you are in her shoes, would you choose to convert out just for her? Please think from her position too. She has been living in non halal way for decades and you are now expecting her to convert. Please be fair to her. Since you can accept her being non chinese in the first, why cant you accept her for being non muslim? I believe you would not want to lose her because of religion, right? I understand that this is tough but be brave enough to find the life you want and courageous enough to chase it. If you lose her now, i do not know when you can meet someone you love and someone who love you back.

I was in your position before and i chose to respect my chinese wife' decision for not converting. We are now living happily for 6 years. At home, everything is halal. However, i respect her for eating non halal food when we are outside the house. As for my child, he follows my surname and is a free thinker. We will let him to choose his own religion when he grows up. All religions are the same. It teaches us to be a better person and to respect others.

785,"My boyfriend (23M) and I (21F) have been going out for sometime and things are great. I've been with multiple guys in my life (sexually) and therefore have multiple experiences, whereas for him he has never been with any one sexually (although he is so hot). Anyway, I'll keep this short. 

So we both know what we like in sex; I am very submissive while he is very dominant. Once, when drunk, things got hot and we had a very very good time except that we couldn't fk properly because we were both too drunk. Well we finally tried to do it again once sober when things got hot and steamy again. 

I was mostly on top of him making most of the moves and I noticed from the very beginning already that he seemed to have not much clue as to what to do/ how to continue. It was a bit weird for me because I am not used to making almost all the moves and being on. top most of the time. But knowing that he might be worried about it as he doesn't have much experience, I just tried to keep things going and  kind of guide him at times. Then he began to do more and you know getting and top and all that but right before we were going to fk, I noticed he slowed down and there were moments he would just look at me for a really long time or look into space. 


Well, I started asking him if things were fine, etc but he just said things like yeah don't worry it's fine. But clearly there was something wrong because he continuedhaving this worried look. I slowed down and got up, looked him in the eyes and told him to not worry and that he can tell me anything. Finally, he told me that he was really worried that sex would turn out shitty, that he wouldn't be able to please me, thathe felt like a baby beside me because he didn't know what to do. 

I just tried to comfort him, telling him that it didn’t matter to me, to focus on himself, and that we can get better with practice. That the optimal sex between 2 different people is always different. However, no matter what I say, I can’t get him to stop worrying... 

Please guys, is there anything I can do/say to help him feel better? If you were in his position, what would help? Should I try to guide him more (initiate more)? Thanks in advance everyone. Will update.

My best friend is in NUS and is one of the sweetest person I ever known, who would rather secretly stare at her crush than talk to them. Recently, she started seeing a guy - he was taking her out for dates every week, making promises of where to take her after finals, texting her... You know the drill. She didn’t tell me about him (I only found out about him when I saw them them by chance on a date), but she was the happiest I seen her in a long time. Suddenly, after sending her home... He one up and disappeared. No text, no calls, no replies, nothing. 

I didn’t even know what was going on until I called her and realised she was crying. After asking, she finally told me he disappeared, and was wondering what she did wrong (spoiler: probably nothing at all). While I was beyond mad and cursing him, guess what? She was still defending him, saying he might be busy, saying it was reading week, and being worried that something might have happened. We opened Instagram together and low and behold, he was alive and well, posting about studying in school with his friends.

I’ve known her for many years and this was the first time I’ve seen her so sad... And it’s all YOUR fault. I mean if you’re truly busy you could always send her a text telling her you gonna MIA. If you wanted to stop seeing her and end dating, just tell her it’s not working out. Ghosting her without an explanation is cowardly after all the time you spent together! This is why NUS science guys have a bad rep and keep ending up in scandals, after all, the lot of you seem to be the same kind.

801,"For reasons which are ignorant and stupid, my parents disapprove of my relationship with my GF. Hence I am left with no choice but to elope for the sake of my lifelong happiness. The only question is: when?

Since I am still halfway through my degree, I originally planned to elope after graduation in 2 years time. However, due to visa issues, my GF cannot stay in Singapore that long. In any case, her hometown is a small village so there are few jobs available for uni grads - even my poly diploma is probably overkill. I am confident that since everybody knows everybody in her village, there is no problem finding a job once I arrive. Frankly, I am not a snobbish like other Singaporeans, so I don’t feel the need to waste even more time just to get a useless piece of paper. The quality of education in NUS is not as high as its rankings suggest, so I wont be missing out on much. 

And yet... even though logic dictates that I should drop out of NUS, I am hesitating. Do I just not love my GF enough to make this sacrifice for her? Am I subconsciously being racist and judgemental like my parents? Or am I just a spoilt singaporean brat who prefers material comforts over true love?

I have too much curiosity and no focus and discipline. As such, I take more time than I should to complete a task, and emerge with a lot of extra (irrelevant) knowledge too. While accumulating knowledge is good, it hinders me from achieving aims quickly and efficiently.

I meet deadlines; I just do last-minute disaster mitigation work, which has worked until now. But I do recognise the need to change.

As a follow up to a previous post, I just wanted to say that I was very surprised with Singaporeans. I've been in different parts of Asia and usually really like the people, but here is different. Some people are so rude! In some stores you say hello and they don't even answer, no thank you either. This has happened more times in a few months here than ever before for me. In class, students constantly arrive late and leave early, talk and eat loudly, sleep right in front of the professor. Some will snort extremely loudly for one hour! I mean just go blow your nose... I don't know if this is a cultural clash or if i've been very unlucky. I've of course met some nice locals, but the whole culture seems a little bit oppressive. A lot of people will blindly follow orders/instructions even when it literally makes no sense. And everything here is always about work! Students do sports because they think it will look good on their CV, they always talk about school. When you go to nightclubs the locals usually don't even dance, they just go to buy bottles and show off. Even the relationships here sound transactional (why are Singaporeans so obsessed with concepts like FWBs?).
Anyway, to sum up, you guys are obviously very organized and hard-working but you could gain a lot (especially for mental health) by working on creativity, relaxation and spontaneity. 
Once again I've met some wonderful people here, and I genuinely wonder if some locals agree with me.

For me, it is a tiny toy turtle I had since primary school. When my girlfriend first saw it, she laughed at it and called it ugly for being all torn and stitched up. Often, she would squeeze it and threaten to throw it out the window because it looks “ugly”. One time, she even threatened me and asked me to choose between her and the turtle. Calling it names, physically abusing it and everything she does towards it ignited a strange sort of rage in me and one time, I even contemplated hitting her.

825,"TL;DR: On exchange, friends take advantage of me and a few others because we choose peace over drama. Can't figure out if it is my problem or my friends are just being an ass. Would you all leave such toxicity behind and live your own life, or try to give in more even though you had tried your best to be understanding in unreasonable situations. Where is humanity? 

I am a NUS FASS student currently on exchange at the US with 12 other friends from NUS. A few friends of mine took advantage of me during this exchange trip because I tend to place others before myself. There are times I know two to three of them are taking advantage of me, yet I choose to not rebut just to maintain peace. However, I am beginning to burn out and feel that there is a problem with myself. 

When things need to be completed, I tend to be disciplined and stick to the timetable I have set for myself. Such as missing a few drinking sessions just to catch up on my work or apply for internships. Hence, this act of mine may be seen as ""not cool"". Also, ever since I got offered an internship position 2 months back, a close friend of mine who is on this exchange with me has been sarcastic and mean towards me. It just gets worse each day. 

Another guy A was discriminated by them due to the fact that they feel guy A is ""uninteresting"". However, this is really subjective and a few of us beg to differ.

Girl B then got ostracized after they feel that she is sensitive and uptight. 

Now, it is my turn because one of them made a false claim on me and I confronted her. In her defence, she said it was a 'joke'. However, how can someone be so petty over this small matter? Also, I thought we are all adult enough to talk it out. She refuses to speak to me and avoided me for weeks. 

It's always that few outspoken-extroverts that go on gossiping and ostracize people,  and the few intermediaries that choose to remain silent to maintain peace. Where is humanity? Why can't people just be kind?

Since then, I couldn't help thinking about the way people act post-relationships. Is it insensitivity or cruelty?
Long story short, my girl friend was seeing this guy over a year ago. They dated for almost half a year (at least as far as I remember), every one knows about it. Less than a week after the break up guy started dating another girl, posted about it all over instagram. Mutual friends' instastories feed were buzzing with his updates, about how they dined together, studied together, hang out in his dorm room where him and his ex just spent a series of nights together just a few weeks ago, yeah you get the picture.
And eventually in his 6-month anniversary with his new love he posted a super cheesy post with all the sappy cringy phrases, and a special reference to his ex as ""past mistake"".
I know, that what I think about his action, has no impact on his life at all. And that, being utterly callous after falling out of love is far too common. Girls also burn and trash their exes' stuff, rubbing their rebounds into exes' faces. And there are other things, that happened between the abovementioned ex-lovers, which for the sake of my friend's well-being, I'd rather not say.
But what is all of these for?
To prove your attractiveness? That you deserve to be loved? That your life is better without your ex?
I can understand that if you have been cheated, or abused mentally and physically, and you want to show the world that, leaving the person who hurt you, you still can be happy. Ok, fine!
But what about those lovers that are gentler, kinder, more harmless? For whichever reasons, you still chose to leave them - he doesn't make enough money, she isn't exactly girlfriend material, not submissive enough, not romantic enough, the sparks are gone... But is it necessary to cast aside all the bonds created be it long or short term but still exist, to belittle people with your new love which no one knows how long it may last (hours or days)?
What did you prove? You're strong, lovable, cute?
Or your shamelessness and insensitivity to the point of callousness, towards someone who used to be """"before anything else"" to you?
Please do not use ""everyone has the rights to be happy"" to justify your action.
Yes, everyone deserves happiness.
Nobody forbids you to love again, even love more than before, giving your all. It is your heart and your life, so it's your rights.
Back to the above story, yup it's fine. Maybe only then did that guy find his true love. And of course, he has the rights to love anyone he wants to.
But is it necessary to parade that change of heart to everyone, in front of the embarrassment of the person who used to be yours? Especially when we just learnt about your separation a few days before?
And that the time you spent together, moments shared, promises made have no meaning whatsoever?
Does this mean that the rights to love and freedom of expression give you the rights to trample on the dignity of a person you used to be with, as well as your own self-respect?
I don't know if someone find that admirable, or touching or whatever, I don't care. All I find is contempt.
Only know to love yourself, take care of your own pride, willing to disrespect the feelings of someone who used to love you, give you things that are precious to them. What a cold hard slap in the face.
Then what's the point of love, if what you get back is callousness?

I expected them to be tolerant. Instead of that what I got was being chased out of the house. 

I slept at the HDB staircase last night. All I have with me are my phone, wallet and charger, a bag with some clothes and a water bottle. I’m fine right now, i use the charging ports and free WiFi at the mall nearby and I’m able to refill my water bottle/wash my face at the toilet. 

What do I do now? I’m really confused, hurt, and I hate myself - I feel suicidal. I’m a student, I don’t have much money and I don’t know how much longer I will be able to sustain myself. I feel like calling the police and asking them to bring my to IMH (at least I will have a place to stay).

840,"I broke up 6 months ago with my one and only ex. We had a 4 years relationship. It has been smooth sailing until his time to serve NS came. I matriculated into uni, expanded my social circle a few times more than the one I had back when I was 18. Due to the lack of communication, meet ups etc, he started getting insecure which leads to his jealousy. But we still hung on till his ORD. Thought everything would carry on like how it did before he got into army and I got into uni, but somehow, things started getting worse. Even his mom came into the picture. She kept complaining about the number of male friends I hang out with. And although he always defends me, both of us knew that the relationship wouldn't work out if it continued this way so we came to a decision and broke up.

6 months have passed and I haven't gotten over him. My heart feels so empty. I miss his smile, his existence, his messages in the morning, his sweet gestures and all the effort he puts into the relationship. I still read his messages during my free time and look through our photos every other night. What made it even worse, since both of us applied and got into the same major, we constantly bump into each other on campus. He would be holding a cup of iced milo which I used to make him quit the coffee addiction he had during A levels. And every single time I take a glance, he would be wearing the watch both of us got for our 2nd anniversary. Since both of us separated on good terms, although we don't contact, he would still wave when our eyes meet but I'd always pretend that I didn't notice.

It's been 6 months and I still love him. The urge of getting back with him is really strong especially when I see him on campus, but my friends discouraged me from goimg back to him. I'm just really afraid he doesn't feel the same way anymore since it has been quite a while or what if he already has a girlfriend, since there is this girl who is frequently on his insta story. Or if we actually got back, the same problem would arise. I'm super conflicted. How?

CS2105 now requires CS2040S, so your situation is different from your seniors. For your seniors, they could take CS2040S, CS2105, CS2106 (<- these are core mods btw), and other non-core modules like CS2107 in Y2S1, so delaying CS2040S doesn't really hurt progression of CS modules.  Now, you guys have one less module to take in Y2S1 so I wouldn't delay CS2040S if I were you, cos you'll need CS2040S for CS2103T too.
Btw, CS2030 and CS2040S are both in Java. So your workload is technically lessened by taking both mods together (profit).
Some of your seniors delayed CS2040S because Prof Harold (another awesome lecturer) teaches more topics and teaches them really well in Sem 1. This year though, the Profs are equally fantastic for CS2040S in Sem 2, so I'd simply take CS2040S without a second thought. I think most of your seniors would agree. 
Anyway, this is just some info to help u make your judgement, seniors pls add in if I missed out anything

I know I should probably just ask but it'd be stupid if it's me who really did make them angry and I still ask them ""why are you angry""

Is there a more indirect way of asking? I'm confused and it really hurts to know that the most important person in your life is ghosting you.

844,"student who is gonna grad soon. I feel so out of place because a lot of my richer, more well to do friends are planning on where to study masters while I have to go find a job. Not that I mind, because that was how I planned it out as well, but I can't help but feel envious of people who have the opportunity to even consider doing masters. some of them even complain that their parents are pressuring them to do masters and it just makes me so envious. They also go on yearly family holidays and even go on family grad trips and I'm so envious because my family hasn't gone on a family trip in years due to financial woes. I know I shouldn't be comparing because every family is different, but when they keep bringing it up I can't help but feel sad because I can't relate to any of them. Even if I wanted to do masters, it will probably be many years later after I earned enough financially because I know my parents don't have the monetary capacity for it. sigh. ????

845,"Just read #72102. I've been thinking lately about my experiences of growing up in Singapore. It's strange I can't feel an attachment to it.

This country moves quickly, setting up new structures in one place while tearing down buildings in others. In the schools I studied at, my classmates often have a tunnelled focus on improving their grades, propping up their portfolios, and keeping a sharp eye out for extracurricular opportunities. In the places I interned at, my colleagues complained about work, but otherwise they worked on their project, then the next and the next and the next.

I expect some will tell me that's the working life, that there's little choice if you want to survive. Still, sometimes I will return from college and notice advertisements promoting tuition for pre-nursery kids. 

I think about finding a partner and having children in Singapore. The financial burden doesn't worry me as much. Instead, I wonder if I'll have the will and courage to not give in to the fear that has driven my parents' way of raising me. I don't blame them for placing pressure on my academics. They never cared about that until they met my classmates' parents, and unwittingly internalised the idea that their children's results determined their worth as mothers and fathers. I feel sorry for them, to be honest. I don't think our childhoods were quite what they wished for my sibling and I to have when they first decided to start a family.

The whole kiasu, kiasi thing used to be funny when I was younger, like it was normal and part of the Singaporean culture and identity. It doesn't feel amusing anymore. I'm 20 and I get I have so many decades ahead of me. Living in a safe and wealthy country is no small privilege either. Oftentimes I'm grateful for the things and relationships I have.

I can talk all I want about how societal approval shouldn't affect my day-to-day living. But I can't deny that it does and spending every moment trying to go against the grain tires me. I am tired of wanting to strive for excellence because of the fear that otherwise I will not be good enough. Most of all, I'm afraid that if I spend the rest of my life here, eventually I'd wake up on my deathbed and realise I haven't amounted to anything more than capital for a city I wish I loved.

Suddenly he said rather seriously “I’m not planning to get married anyway” I was rather shocked that he said that so I didn’t ask him to elaborate more about why he said that. 
He is single at the moment but he had an ex in the past (so I guess that he is straight and not gay)
But since he had said that I guess this is a sign for me to get over him.

I have told him upfront, verbatim that I will never like him. I have rejected all his advances but he thinks that I'm just playing hard to get and that I actually like him. I swear on my conscience that I have NEVER misled him. I don't reply his texts and even went as far as to blocked him everywhere, but somehow he still believes that I like him. The only reason he likes me is because he used to be an outcast in my secondary school and I was the only one who did not openly oppress him. He mistook my kindness for love. 

Since then, he has stalked me (like, physically to my house), tried to guilt-trip me into giving him hugs and even threatened suicide recently. The idea of just being with him disgusts me but I am so afraid that he will really go through with his threat. His mom even contacted me and told me that his blood will be on my hands if I reject him again and he really kills himself. I am so stressed out. He says things like wanting to impregnate me and that scares me out of my wits. I have never had a boyfriend and he thinks that I’m ‘waiting for him’.

850,"I had a relationship with a Malay guy, lasting for 5 years. He is 4 years older than me, knew him when I was 18. Before the relationship, he told me that it would be okay for me not converting if things get serious between us because he does have a cousin who married a Mongolian without having the wife to convert (civil marriage). His family would be okay with me. Therefore, we started the relationship.  

I am a free thinker so I was rather open to know about Islam during the relationship. 

So fast forward to the stage where we’re considering marriage as the next step, it became a concern when my family did not know anything about me and him.
I was very selfish to hide the relationship from my parents all the way.  Because it was really hard, knowing that a lot of things would possibly change within the family, I did not want to risk the peace of mind of my parents. 

Why? Because I noticed that he changed his mind. 
He started to drop hints, wanting me to convert after we got together for two years. I know it probably because he wanted to be serious with me, he gave me the reasons like our kids cannot keep his name as father name, I would go to the hell after death, his father would not approve our marriage, or I would teach the wrong things to his kids.  

I did seriously consider convert. The real deal-breaker is when he kept repeating that I have nothing to lose after converting because I am a free thinker, it should be easy. I was really saddened by this comment from him. He did not see things in my position at all. He did not know I might be ended up going home every day to have my parents asking me if I am sure about my relationship, or etc etc. 

Therefore, I had second thoughts. He was upset. In his eyes, I was just choosing Pork over him (he literally said that) despite me explain to him all my uncertainty and worries during that life-changing phase. I told him I needed his support and guidance on the decision and I wish he did, instead of being extremely defensive.

The relationship became ugly and unhealthy afterward, having both of us to challenge each other times to times. “Why you love me when I was not a Muslim, but insist to change me now?” “Why are you so religious when you are the one keep asking me for sex before marriage?” He even said that I did not give him my virginity as I did not see him as the one I would end up with. 

I have a close Muslim friend of mine once told me that I should never convert to Islam because of a man, it should be me myself want to. I remember going to the Islam Beginner course alone, which he didn’t even bother to accompany me there. When the instructor asked me where my partner is, that’s the moment that really strikes me. I am on my own, this is a decision for my own life, should not count on that man at all. 

It has been 2 years since I moved on from the relationship. After all, I thought I owe him an apology for hiding the relationship from my family for the whole five years, especially after reading the comments from the other post saying that there is no reason to hide a 5-year relationship. For me, it was not because of what but I felt that we were not sure where we heading, therefore I should not have my family being so worried about so many things unnecessarily. I am sorry. It was my selfish decision. 

Also, congrats on your wedding.

I've always had this deep interest in engineering. From young I would build many LEGO sets and have many imaginary adventures with my brother. As I grew older, however, I realized that I am unable to apply this imagination to my engineering course here at NUS. I have consulted my older sister about this many times, but she always blames it on my inability to let go of my idealistic ways from the past, plus she's too busy with her boyfriend to care. All throughout my teenage years I've thought I could make the world a better place with my inventions, but I guess the Tri-State area will never accept me for who I am.

860,"Ladies I have a problem. So Im in year 2 and recently I fell in love with a guy in class but my Intel gathered is he is single and unavailable aka he wants to be single. But I don't wanna chase too obviously, how to subtlely manipulate him to wanna be attached ah?

OK maybe some backstory will be helpful,

so we have been in the same class for 2 years already but we have never talked to one another. He always looks so serious and detached. He never socialize outside of his cliche of 5, he ain't the handsome popular type and he has no CCA everyday go school and disappears, basically 宅男. 

This semester I was late for class on the first day and cos the module needs 6 per project group and his cliche of 5 is missing 1 and my cliche of 7 abandon me :(... in the end I was put tgt with them. 

Wah at first I was like SMLJ, but wah.... 

First of all, I think this module I finally can get my first A in Uni his whole cliche average CGPA 4.8 sia OMG carry me Oppas. 

Secondly I learn he was a PS in their company in NS and his cliche is all his battalion mates. His cliche machiam got hierarchy somemore with him on top. Wah when they are working is really military efficiency: everyone is so reliable and on time, after all meetings got minutes post on WhatsApp chat, meetings never derail, and rarely ever have meetings cos most of the time instructions are passed down on WhatsApp. Wah I in this group, I feel like the module like easy only while my own cliche is struggling.

When he is leading meetings and WhatsApp chats wah the decisiveness, the charisma, the ideas, and how the group respect him.... Wah I almost 动心了. 

Then one day the group decide to go his house for meeting after school cos he stay near NUS. Then I really witness the 宅, wah his room is shelves of manga, bed full of soft toys, gaming setup, really is 宅. But go his house liao I really don't know why I really 动心了. When we reach his house he went to bathe and when he wear his home attire of anime singlet and baggy sweater pants, I observed hard till almost xray shoot out of my eyes and..... dayum gurl how can it be a 宅男 be so lean and fit. 

After awhile I think I managed to mingle into their inner circle and they started to treat me more openly and over time i realise dayum this bugger is really..... Errrr..... Contrasting. Like when he is working, total concentration no bullshit talk, no distractions, charismatic, in summary 帅 but when he isn't working he is like the chillest of chill, jokes, the sick burns and memes. This contrast really turns me on.

So i started asking around, his friends told me they have been suaning him since NS to get attached but he says he wanna stay single. Says his reason is he barely can even take care of himself how to take care of GF and he wanna be free, indepedent, answer to no one. Then I'm like but he take care of you guys leh and you guys burden him also leh?..... Then they told me that they think it was a problem with his EQ not his IQ.... Which I kinda get it. He really is those slow warmer type, those kind which you hate at the start cos they are so direct and insensitive at the start but as they get to know you better, he get more and more sensitive kinda guys. It doesn't help that he doesn't try at all to socialize and make friends as well.

So i started to hint hint very mildly, but he wah really is hopeless. But I really want him. How? The only thing I can think of is I pose the qns first. But I don't wanna leh cos I dun think he will like it. How? Ladies and guys help me plox.

P.S. to my cliche, ladies u are great friends but bad students haha next group project I think I gonna abandon u gurls liao sry. :) I found myself some academic sugar daddies hahaha.

We have been dating for close to a year and are madly in love with each other. Since the beginning, I have been wanting to have sex with him but he always say he's not ready. Today, I finally can't take it anymore and pulled down his pants while he was sleeping, wanting to give him at least a bf before lessons. To my horror, it was small, like a baby carrot if I may. I was so shocked I starting trembling and almost broke down. Seeing me and his pants down, he started crying and said his objection of having sex was due to his small size and he said he wanted for us to settle down before talking about it. I feel so cheated and disappointed considering I expected his to be much larger.

I have a HUGE problem. I am constantly horny and I can't handle my urges that well.

So I am in a 1 year relationship with my boyfriend. He is a nice guy, gives me attention as much as he can, because he is working most of the time, I would then go on and hang out with my friends a lot. Didn't help that most of my friends are guys. I used to cheat on a former 2 year ex with many other guys and I never felt bad or guilty about it until I talked things out with him but you know, i moved on real quick without issues.

My ex at that time was manipulative although loving but i didn't want to continue being with him. Fortunately, managed to break things off with him.

So back to my 1 year relationship, i almost cheated on him with some other people but i really held back because this time I thought maybe I will indeed feel guilty so better not cheat.

But then I still feel like cheating because it's what I had been doing all this time. I feel like shit. What do I do?

Also, I feel like it's not fair for my boyfriend just cos I have a shitty reason such as BEING HORNY.

865,"Dear all local university graduates, when you are searching for a job, please ask for a realistic pay. 

Over the past week, I have interviewed some students who have ZERO working experience asking for pay of 7k and onwards.  When asked for their reason for wanting that pay, their reason? ""I graduated from a local university with first class honor"" 

Word of advice to all 
1. Please study the company properly before asking for sky high pay. Not all companies are Google, JP Morgan, Facebook that can give you sky high pay. 
2. Continuing from  point 1. find out who are you interviewing with and read up on his/her profile on LinkedIn etc. I have a handful of candidates whom are already informed that they are meeting the ""Regional Managing Director - APAC"" still tries to correct me on my company. 
3. Don't get all defensive and offended when the interviewer ask you ""Why do you think you deserve this pay"" etc.
4. Grades is nothing to the eyes of more and more companies, we are looking for the right person with the right attitude. Few years back, I hired a student from NUS who was nearly expelled twice and took 6 years to complete his degree. Today he is one of my managers with a team of 20 under him. 

With that, wishing all graduates good luck and all the best. Peace out

We have all heard of big bosses who only have primary education and yet could build up big successful businesses. There are property and insurance agents who only have a diploma and making six figure incomes. Ok maybe you can say that these are only a tiny percentage of people. But there are also many other examples. There are people who quit their white collar jobs and were successful being hawkers/ chefs/ small business owners and these jobs don't need a degree. There are also countless stories of people with only A level or diploma who are successful in their careers. What's the point of studying so hard and spending 4 years taking exams, just to join a job that may not be related to your degree at all? Worse, you can just simply be retrenched at your 40s because you have become too expensive and overqualified.

878,"I am a current NUS undergraduate dating an older, married man. Lets call him Jerry (Not his real name). I would like to take this opportunity to address some misconceptions that many people here on NUSWhispers have regarding girls in my situation. 

1. Love

I love Jerry. I really do. In an alternate universe where Jerry was a NUS student, I would hunt him down during orientation, hold his hands and never let go for the rest of my life. Jerry is kind, sweet, intelligent and wise. I love it that no matter what problem I may encounter in my daily life, I know I can count on Jerry to provide me with a fresh perspective and good solutions. Girls on NUSWhispers: Imagine having your own personal Prof Ben who is available 24/7 to answer any of your questions and do naughty stuff with you. Doesn't that sound super romantic?

2. Money

Ours is not a sugar relationship. When we met, I didn't know that he was rich: All I knew when we first met was that he was on vacation with a naggy wife who didn't know how to appreciate the historical significance of the place we were visiting, and I was likewise on vacation with an immature ex-bf who was married to his iphone games.  

Now let us address the elephant in the room: the issue of money. I have two confessions to make. First, I admit that I find successful men attractive. Second, I admit that while I do not receive any monthly allowance or credit cards, I do receive gifts of jewellery, clothes, handbags, etc. As a matter of principle, I never check the value of the gifts I am given. However, based on common sense, I would estimate their value to be no less than the equivalent of $5k monthly as quoted in the previous confession. 

However, before you judge me, consider this:

A. Self-made rich people tend to be smart, driven, attentive to detail and have nonzero communication skills. These are all extremely desirable traits in a boyfriend. At the very beginning, if I am to be brutally honest with myself, maybe I was indeed attracted by Jerry's money. However, as we spent more time together and slowly accumulated the usual emotional baggage present in every relationship, it is ultimately Jerry's personality, not his money, that keeps me devoted to him.

B. My ex receives a monthly allowance from his parents of approximately $500 a month, of which approximately $50-$100 is spent on me. Jerry's monthly remuneration is a six digit figure, so $5k a month is not unreasonable. In fact, if you do the math, I am probably slightly underpaid in this relationship... 

3. The wife problem

I am probably unique because I have actually seen and interacted with the wife before. Overall, I think that apart from her constant nagging and lack of cultural awareness, she seems reasonably attractive and any guy would be lucky to have her. I do not hate her, neither do I love her. Sometimes, when Jerry has to cancel on me due to some family appointment, a terrible rage boils up within me and I think of doing evil things to her. Yet, these moments of rage are balanced by the quiet, introspective moments in the middle of a boring lecture where I pity her for her ignorance and feel guilty for being the ""homewrecker"" in her marriage. 

To be honest, I am not really sure where our relationship is headed right now. I love Jerry very much and want to marry him sometime in the future, yet I don't really want to see his wife's large stupid eyes filling up with tears. I also don't really want to be a stepmother to their children. A few months ago, Jerry brought up the possibility of divorce and we discussed it seriously. Unfortunately, Jerry's wife got pregnant again so our plans are temporarily on hold. We have not discussed this issue since then. 

For now, my relationship with Jerry is my beautiful secret: neither my family nor my friends in NUS know about this. I love Jerry very much. Perhaps the OP of 68088 is right and the best thing for me to do in my situation is to screw society and enjoy the happiness that I found in an unexpected place...

880,"Hello all, just a warning that it’s gonna be a long read ahead...

Recently, my friends (both females and males) have been increasingly flaking/ ghosting me on text and in real life... :( 

With regards to text, it’s always one of the following these days:

 1. Don’t open my message (but some of their last seen clearly says something ????).
2. Blue tick/ leave me hanging on  “seen” forever (?) (like until now it remains a blue tick/ “seen”).
3. Reads message, replies only 2-3 days later.

Sigh, I know it’s finals season and everyone is busy — I’m busy too. And I honestly don’t expect any instantaneous reply. 

But surely y’all can reply during your breaks as your day passes? It  doesn’t feel good at all when they leave me on read and take 2-3 days to reply me. I start to have self-doubts that I said/ done something wrong... :(

Personally, if I need more time to reply to a message, I would just drop one sentence “busy atm will reply later” so that I won’t leave people hanging. Am I being unfair/ demanding in wishing my friends at least let me know that they are busy and need more time before they can get back to my messages?

And speaking of flaking/ ghosting, I have made arrangements/ plans with some of said friends recently. Unfortunately, in the past two weeks, I have encountered last minute cancellations on me at least thrice already!! (Fyi, some of the plans were prearranged weeks ago, so these last minute cancellations kinda struck me real hard when I go onto Instagram stories and find out that the real reason I got ghosted is because they are busy hanging out with other friends... AKA I’m being replaced (?), like wow I’m lost for words.)

I’m angry, but more than that, I’m truly hurt. Why? Well, I have to laugh things off and pretend I’m “okay”, when in reality I’m far from okay. Just because we have been friends for years, and therefore I shouldn’t hold a grudge over such “small” matters aka forgive and forget? It’s one thing to be cancelled upon, but another thing when they don’t see the need to apologise on the account of our years of friendship?

I do not wish to put a strain on our years of friendship just because of these seemingly “minor” matters, but it still hurts that years of friendship may actually lead to complacency and overlooking of such basic respects as humans? :( 

I still love and cherish my friends and hoping this is just a temporary phase... I can’t help but start to question if the fault lies with me instead...

To those who read through that whole chunk of my lament: Thanks for sticking by, provide me with some advice please? :(

It is good to ask for advice but ultimately you are the one making your own decision, be it to S/U a mod, confess, plan for something, etc. Once you have decided on something, stop looking back and move on or else it will never end. You should be the one making your own judgement and not be overly influenced by others.

Wishing all of you a merry and blessed christmas . Just like to share my 2 cent worth. In the corporate world, in certain industries ,your degree can only bring you to the door/interview. What determines increment or promotion is ability to resolve and alleviate issues at work at shortest possible time. I have seen people with 10 years and above or less than 3 years leaving their respective firms as they were done with learning or had enough experience to have a more challenging career. But the key is the jump must be to a ideal firm that can provide platform to perform, which then leads to higher salary and better remuneration package. There is no definite answer in the corporate world Good Luck.

884,"There's this guy that likes me a lot, and I like him too. As we got closer with each other, we started acting more like couples - flirting, giving each other nicknames, going out more etc. We've gone out quite a few times and we we both said that we like each other a lot. He confessed to me, but I felt we both needed a bit more time and he was willing to wait. Can tell he really likes me and cares for me, from all the little actions he does, and he's a great person in many ways - good looks, intelligent, ambitious, and we share the same aspirations and values. 

But I have feelings for this other guy. This sounds kind of wrong but I've been secretly going out and getting close with this other guy (but technically we are just friends and friends can still go out). I realise this other guy makes my heart flutter more. I sometimes imagine us being together. He treats me very well too.

What should I do? 

I know the first guy and I are almost like couples, but technically I haven't accepted or rejected him yet so I don't think it's cheating if I go for the second guy? At the back of my mind I know I may regret losing the first guy. But what if the second guy is better? 

Should I still give the second guy a try? Or should I just stick with the first one?

886,"I have a friend who owes me a large sum of money (3 digits). It's been a year since I lent it to him and he still hasn't returned it. I gave him three reminders, and every time he says he has not enough money and will return next time. I really want to believe him, but he has a history of dishonesty, not just in money matters, but also in school and life (which I have also called him out for, but he repeatedly denies it and tells me to mind my own business).

Also, he relies on taxis all the time because he's always late, and has managed to travel overseas multiple times throughout the past year. And he spends a lot overseas. And he has an expensive smoking habit (like 1 pack a day). So I find it very unbelievable that he has no money to return back to me.

I have presented this evidence to him, but he always laughs it off and changes the subject. Once, I attempted to really grill him with the evidence and make sure he gives me a proper answer, and he suddenly got defensive and accused me of being so intrusive into his personal life. He painted himself as the ""better man"" who tries to solve conflicts amicably, while I was painted as the guy who always picks up a fight with him.

What can I do? 1) Should I continue to try and change his character as a good friend? 2) Will I ever see my money again?

887,"I was from one of those ‘elite’ schools. When I graduated, I wanted to go to a prestigious universities in the US/UK. Not only was I attracted by the prestige and bragging rights that come along with it, I also wanted to escape Singapore and my parents, and enjoy that party life that seems ubiquitous overseas and is barely existent in our local universities. However, I applied to all the top schools and no one accepted me. I came close to getting Cambridge (I got into the winter pool) but was given a rejection nonetheless. The only acceptance letter I had was from NUS. My pride would not allow it and I vowed to try again over my 2 years in NS. Some of my schoolmates are going to top schools overseas and I felt as though they will think I am a failure if I ended up in NUS. However during NS, when see other people from different backgrounds, I start to realise that NUS is actually a pretty good school and that people actually try rather hard to get into it; a vastly different perspective from that of dumping ground back in my school for people who can’t make it to oxbridge/ivy. My diminishing willpower from depression in camp, compounded with the consideration of my parent’s financial situation, made me decide not to try again and be content with NUS. Now, I am currently a Year 1 student here and whenever I see my friends partying in the halls of cambridge/ harvard, something inside me would die a little. Personally, I feel that the party life is sorely lacking in here and all everyone does is mug. But one thing I realise is, party life aside, that it is not just about which university you are in, but whether u can excel in it. As long as I can excel in NUS, it doesn't matter that I am not a harvard boy does it?

a lot of ppl would say that im dating someone out of my league. im aware that he has a lot of girls interested in him while i do not have any.
which is why, when i found a skimpy dress in his closet one day, i didn’t confront him abt it. im happy that he still chose to be seen with me and known to others that i am his gf and i refuse to allow this as a reason for a breakup. afterall, all guys can be a little cheeky sometimes and what is more important is they know who to go home to right?
thats what i keep telling myself. but ever since i found the dress, i became more attentive to his movements. sometimes when he’s not around i would dig through his things, try to sneak up on him when he’s using his phone etc. 
then the day came when i stumbled on my golden opportunity. we were at his place,he was taking a shower and he had left his laptop open. my fingers flashed across the touch pad. search history. emails. videos. photos- i saw something i hoped i never laid eyes on. a photo album of my bf in ladies’ outfit. one of them included the skimpy dress i found.

891,"Hey everyone, I am really at a loss in this relationship and I need your advice on how to move forward.

Let’s call him/her G. We have been together for a little more than a year. But it has not been smooth sailing. Back to the beginning, I met G while in my CCA. As time passed and we were practicing for our performance, I unknowingly fell for G. To find out more about G, I went to ask some of my mutual friends and their advice was that we are not suitable for each other. G was deemed as someone that is quite needy and needs much more attention and I’m considered to be the kind of person that is more independent and wants instead of needs in a relationship (idk how to explain also). 

Fast forward to after the performance, I was about to spend a semester overseas for exchange. At this point we are still not together but things were complicated where we went out on dates (guess we’re dating?) and flirted with each other quite a bit. But G is already quite possessive and does not like that there are two people that are opposite gender of mine in the group of friends i’m going on exchange with. I promised that I will not get too close with them even though i was close with one of them (Lets call him/her H. and H was a SA in a group where I was MGL). So off I went to my exchange and so the start of my hell (note that i was not together with G at that point). when my exchange started, G was behaving very bizarrely and getting upset at every little thing that i did. During the orientation party that my exchange school organised for all the exchange students, H got very drunk and could not get back to the dormitories on his/her own, other friends of that group were also not available because it’s either they went for second round or that he have to go back to the dorms earlier. So it was only H and me. The whole time our buddies and I only hold H until we reached the roadside and H just sat at the curb and fell asleep while i was looking everywhere for a cab while still making sure that H is safe. It was just entering spring and I have gave my coat to H so H will not catch a cold. I believe what I did was just being a good friend helping another friend out. But i was scolded and flared up upon by G for all the things i have done. Am i supposed to have left H there or what is another thing that i should have done because i really don’t know what i should have done.
Another time, the whole group of us went to get some street food and not wanting to spend too much money, the group decided to share some of the street food. In the end I shared my food (which is not even like a corn cob that kind where you have to “share” saliva with the other person) with H. I told G about this incident and even assured that nothing happened, yet I was bombarded with all the toxic scolding, it was like mental torture. I cannot really remember the exact things G said but I remembered that i was forced to keep my contacts with the two of them at the minimal. 
Then, there were even times where the whole group was deciding to go somewhere together but i just faked illness or tiredness to not go. Due to all these incidents, I have to cut all the contacts with H unless it’s for work or like formal stuff. Which i found ridiculous and like absurd. But in the end I obliged with it...  

Another thing happened during exchange that forever scarred me. While all the above were happening, G dares to say that G wants to go and meet with someone that G has a crush on. (I know, even i find it absurd when i read back what i typed). That incident ended with G saying it's his/her way of finding out whether he/she has feeling for me (like WTF). I was so sad when this happened that i went to a quiet place and cried while calling my close friend back in sg.

Another incident is that G went to visit a close friend at that person's hall (opposite gender) and the two of them drank in the room alone. Yet I am here having to cut my contacts with other people when I am hanging out in a group.

But i admit that i have done things that i promise i will keep my word but not kept my word. Things like keeping in contact with G as much as possible. Skyping G almost everyday for as long as i can. Im not saying that i dont want to do those things, but i dont think i should be scolded for not doing that sometimes, because of just how much i am already doing it.

By the end of the exchange, I realised i have only remember all the quarrels and scoldings and arguments and nothing much about the actual exchange. But i thought okay it will finally be over and yeah maybe G is just very sad that i go so far and for so long.

We eventually got together after I came back from exchange. But G started having issues with my other friends. particularly my closest friends from uni. In this group of friends, we are always without filters and always joke about very inappropriate things and thats how our group dynamic is, and we understand that what everyone in the group is joking about are just joking and no real intentions behind it. But G cannot take it and wants me to cut contact with those friends that i have hang out with since i started uni.
We already have a post graduation trip planned within the group and when i asked if i could bring G along, the group was not very fond of the idea because  they want the exchange to be with people they are really close with and because of what they have heard about G and how G treated me while i was on exchange. Again, the grad trip was a nightmare and much worse than what happened during the exchange. I was not happy at all during the trip, and many times i just stayed in the airbnb all day instead of going out with the rest, I hardly interacted with everyone and even when I went out with the group, I have to constantly take pictures to show that i am way behind and away from the group and not participating in the group conversation of whatever. I was in agony and it was the worst trip. 
Long story short, right now I have still not contacted them or met up with them since after graduation. 

G has always forced me through various ways that i am the one that f-ed up and G is the one that should the priority. I was made to make many promise about things that i dont even believe in if not the argument and quarrel will never end. I am so so sick of all these things happening. 

Right not, I have not contacted that group of friends. but recently I got interested in an activity and have been meeting around once a month with two other very very close friends of mine whom i knew from secondary school. Yet when i told G about this monthly meetup, G told me that it is a bit excessive to meet once a month. I was speechless. 

Another thing, I am currently working at a small company that hires quite a lot of interns. And when i tell G that i went for lunch with the interns, G will get so upset at me and ask me to go and have fun with them and dont talk to G. I am again at loss at work to do about . I am afraid that this will be problem that will just be there forever since i will have to work for another 20 to 30 years.

Another thing is that during my lunch, i am expected to reply G's messages straight away and must keep talking until my lunch is over, even if G is not replying me when i text. 

We are also have a lot of personality clashes such that G is always annoyed with the littlest things. I dont even remember what are the little things.

I am writing this long ass story because i am really really at a loss at what to do from here on. I really love G and I really hope things will become better but I am really feeling bleak on this. I hope the kind community here can give me some advice to steer me towards a decision instead of being stuck in this limbo now. 

TL;DR : Got together with someone, many problems, need help.

892,"Coming to NUS has only made me realize how little I have achieved in my own life.

I've never been part of the typical NUS crowd, where a large majority come from well-to-do families, with an elite JC education. I took the long road to get here, which only compounds the fact that I struggle to feel like I belong here. Everyone around me seems to be achieving so much, but I myself, put in so much effort only to see how little I accomplish. Instagram and LinkedIn continue to torture me, because all I see is how others are performing so much better. They have great jobs/internships, a supportive partner, whilst I am left putting 100% in my work only to realize that I will never amount to my peers.
How do some people have it all? Is this what they mean when they say life is in unfair? I always thought that a person gets what he/she puts in, but I'm starting to think that it's a hopeless endeavour. When you're not academically gifted, you soon realize that trying to succeed is an impossible task. With a low CAP, you lose out at internships and jobs. I don't think anyone understands where I'm coming from, because they have never had to deal with such failure in their life. My friends have always told me to be happy and comfortable with my own journey, but how can you be satisfied when your reality tells you that you are the bottom of the social ladder?
My confidence and belief in myself have really taken a hit since enrolling into NUS. It’s a great environment to push yourself, but sadly, I think I will never amount to the calibre of some individuals here. How can I be proud of what I have accomplished (or lack thereof) when it’s plain and simple for the world to see that others are so much better?
Sorry if I'm sounding like an envious bitch, but really, I'm so jealous. I'm so tired and drained of pretending that I'm happy when deep down, all I can think about is how far I fall short of these standards and expectations. It hurts to know that you will never be good enough for some things in life, or even people.

900,"Honestly as a bilingual Chinese Australian girl who is born in Shanghai and moved to Sydney when I was 13, I'm sick to the death of the divide between Singaporeans and Chinese international students. I came to NUS after finishing my high school in Sydney because why not since some of my relatives from China stay here for background information.

Why on earth does this have to happen? Because of certain norms held that you find unpleasant? Well let me tell you a story, I was bullied in my first year of high school for the exact reasons you guys hate them for. I was mocked for my poor English, the way I dressed, the mannerisms I carried over, I was so lonely and I could only hang out with other Chinese born students in my English as a second language class. I was bullied by Asian Australians who wanted nothing to do with me because they were afraid that someone like me undermined their social standing in Australia. I eventually adapted because in my ESL class, all international students of all backgrounds in my school suddenly started to make friends with each other based on our personalities and who we are as a person, not because of our cultural backgrounds. That way I could finally embrace Australian culture and learn to build bridges between international students in my high school and locals, and realise 'integration' cannot be forced.

Now coming into NUS, I see this very same divide and it reminds me of my high school days. I feel a sense of urgency to bridge this divide as a bicultural individual (well tbh I still find myself more Chinese than Australian because I still dress like someone from Mainland and my traditional values but still pretty Australian in my thought process). Please be understanding of this Chinese international students, they are already in so much financial burden and struggling. We honestly need a dialogue to find a comprimise to bridge this bitter divide.

904,"Graduated 1 year ago. Feeling lost and confused now. Having quit my first job after a few months in it because of some internal matters that drove me semi crazy, I found myself working in a job now that demands high tolerance and patience. I know what many of you will say, that which job doesn't have its own problems. 

Mine is that I feel this job does not have prospects. It doesn't allow me to learn much. Sure the information is abundant and keeps changing every half year, but ultimately the whole cycle repeats itself. To be honest, my own patience is running thin in this job, having to deal with unreasonable people and demands from others. What seems like an obvious answer to me does not seem like one for the others, and I don't mean my colleagues, but the ones that we are providing service to. It's nothing technical at all, the people just need to be more independent, aware and abide to rules that's all. Yet somehow, they can't, and we come in to sort of clean up the mess.

But without the problems there won't be jobs for us right? I agree. But we still have to deal with a lot of backlog and spill overs even when we enter the March or April period, and it's the start of another cycle. And these issues have almost nothing to do with the problems that people come to us to resolve. Everyday we anticipate issues that are out of this world, unheard of and sometimes weird, even after being with us for so long people can still forget or commit the same mistakes. How do we become a tech savvy society when people cannot even search for stuff? It's not python or JavaScript, it's not MATLAB or Solidworks, it's just putting effort to familiarise with the online environment and know what to do.

Adding to this repetitive cycle of shit taking and blame shirking to us is the inability of our higher ups to know what is going on on the ground. They want more results, higher percentage, and tend to like quantitative rather than qualitative. And when we don't meet their expectations, they will comment like it's not part of their jobs to find out what is going on. Why is this service like this? Why are there so little cases resolved? Maybe it's because of the rules set in place? 

I feel out of place here. I feel that I'm not myself and I want to get out. But I can't.

Knowing her results is not good, I feel like helping her. Knowing she have not eaten I will feel like getting/making food for her. 

There are times she make me feel really happy and times she upset me a lot, not sure why but I get jealous easily especially when she share her boy problems or get close to other dudes. We are like super close friends and we are honest and open about everything to each other~ of course except telling her I like her.

Honestly, i feel like confessing to her my feelings but the only issue here is I am a girl too. However, i do not usually feel this way with other girls so i am not sure is it just a one off thing with her because we are so close... 

There are many times she will joke and say if we dont get married by what age we will get married... or like comment saying if she is a dude she will chase after me.. I am not sure is she joking or dropping hints.. With that being said, she is crazy over this dude too which she keep sharing about him to me..  so I am guessing she is straight...?

Recently, I am starting to develop sexual feelings for her which i feel is so real but so unreal at the same time.

I will be heading back to sg soon and will not get to see her anymore, not sure what i should do.. any advice?

906,"After bouncing around a few jobs in companies which seem to be involved in shady business, I was happy to have finally landed a job in this company that has a very strong anti corruption stance. So strong that they insist paying their employees well and senior management handsomely to deter possible corruption.

Problem is that this year, the company cited the weak economy as a reason for reducing the year end variable component to a small fraction of last year’s, and that “in solidarity”, the senior management would forgo theirs and receive a small token sum instead.

I am worried: would this cut in income make the senior management more vulnerable to corruption?

910,"Dear Prof Ben and NUSWhispers community,

TLDR; Girl I like seemed to like me back during school term. Ghosted me during vacation. I don't think she's the kind that would use me but who knows. I want to continue whatever we had. Might be awkward if I want but she doesn't. I'm lost. How should I treat her or go about this tactfully? Even just as friends? 

There's this girl that I really like and have been helping her for homework during the semester. We were very close. She was not rejecting my romantic advances, and sometimes even reciprocating. It seemed mutual. I thought we had a thing but it turns out she just completely ghosted me during the vacation. 

We were so close during the semester. I don't understand why she ghosted me. But maybe something happened or maybe she's just not in the mood? To be fair it could have been something I did that made her decide I don't want this guy. Looking back I realise I haven't really showed her feel loved in the way she wanted despite her hints. Maybe I should be understanding and give her the benefit of doubt. She seemed very genuine during the semester. Not like the kind of girl with a motive. 

But right now when I try to talk to her she'll seem cold and uninterested. We used to talk every day. Now she's not initiating convos and when I do, she'll give me one word replies. She seems like she doesn't want this anymore.

Sometimes it makes me feel like I'm just being annoying and I trying to talk to her is just pestering her. It feels stupid trying to talk to her when she doesn't want to talk. I don't know what happened or if it's something I did wrong. 

There'll prob be a lot of comments telling me to 'ditch her, u just got used' and everything but please don't. 

I still want this relationship (or friendship) and I treasure her as a person. I like her a lot. and there's the possibility that she's just going through something. I just don't want to assume that this is over cause it might not be. 

Right now, I don't know how to continue this 'relationship'. It's hard to continue when the other person is making it feel 'one-way' even tho it used not be. And it's hard to let her know how I feel or ask her directly since we are not exactly boyfriend girlfriend. I just hope that this is a misunderstanding and it'll all work out eventually. What should I do? How do I get things to be like the way it used to. How should I treat her or go about this tactfully? Even just as friends?

914,"#73815 OP here

I realise people misunderstood when I said stay with locals in a share house. I stayed with the British students of the local UK uni not Singaporean locals.

DONT STAY WITH SINGAPOREANS IN A PRIVATE APARTMENT!! 

That's what happened to the large group of Singaporeans who went to Sheffield uni and stayed together. It's more difficult to mix with the British students. You'll regret it. 


The Singaporean student who stayed on campus had other exchange students living next door. Tbh, it's fun to meet other intl students but they kinda stuck to their own clique from their home countries. Most are Erasmus students with 3-5 min coming from each European country. They all know each other.

Travelling to Europe because air tickets from London to other European countries are cheap? I stuck to UK, went to other cities in UK by train. But if you want to go around to Paris, Venice etc, yes, ticket is cheap. Who's gonna pay for the Airbnb, travelling within the city, food, sightseeing? Food is very expensive and you'd be so grateful for our foodcourts.

Studying full time in London? That's a lot of money and a great experience if you want to mix with intl students. But sticking to smaller cities like Manchester, Liverpool, Nottingham allow you to mingle with the average British person.

I stand by my statement. London is expensive. An exchange is a wonderful exposure and I hope those with less money go for exchange. It is possible to go for exchange to UK, just go to a smaller city.  Get the 4K bursary to pay for flight and accomodation for 5 months and your own personal savings to spend.

915,"Agreed with OP from 73793.

I can personally relate to some of those posts where OP meets someone better than current SO of a few years, OP gets confused and asks for advice. I was in the same situation, and eventually let go of then SO as I felt that after so many years, perhaps we weren't really that suitable after all. I just couldn't see us lasting into marriage; our r/s was not problematic but it was simply just staying afloat. Got together with the ""third party"" despite naysayers, and she's now my wife of 2 years.

I can imagine if I posted that of NUSWhispers back then, the comments section would probably be a cesspool of hate comments, ""cut off his kkj!"", ""wah 7 years liao below itchy ah"", ""quickly let her go la you dont deserve your gf"" etc. People here need to learn to be more understanding of other people's situation lol. There is no clear cut right or wrong sometimes; you think you know how to handle it only because you haven't been in the situation yourself.

If you can't make helpful comments, then don't talk at all. In that kind of situation, what people like me (in the past) are looking for is genuine advice, not judgement based on your personal opinion. Just my 2 cents.

Two week ago, after a night out at a pub, we tried to do it at his hostel and he revealed his reason for abstaining. His little brother is no longer than a USB stick. Of course I said it was no issue, but after an awkward 10 minutes of attempting to make it happen, he broke down and started crying. He said his exgf left him for this exact reason and he feels guilty for not telling me earlier on, and started begging me not to leave him. I reassured him that it's really not an issue, as I truly felt that sex wasn't all that important.

But after returning home the next day, thoughts started running through my mind. I'm still a virgin, and will probably remain as one if I marry him in the future. How weird are things now?

However, he has been asking me when I'll be coming over/where and how soon, repeatedly. 

I shared this with my boyfriend to see if I'm reading into things, and he believed his cousin asks out of curiosity. He senses nothing and I dont say too much as well. But I just canttttt stooopp looking, imagining and thinking if his cousin is indeed interested in me and if/when I go over...

930,"Some backstory, I try to not make it long. I've known my best friend for a long time, really long, since we were four. Maybe even longer. We lived in small town and we were neighbors. Our parents know each other. We grew up together, but I didn't start getting attracted to her until I started getting interested in girls, and at this point the relationship already turned into a ""brother-sister"" relationship. But we were kids. I doubt this thing would work anyway.

Time passed. We started maturing, she started to dating. At this point, I realized this ship has sailed, and started dating other women as well, while still being friends with her. I still had feelings for her, but I decided to bury them. It really worked, our friendship was great. We were the best friends. Time was passing.

That was going on until four days ago. Recently I broke up with my ex because she cheated on me. That kinda broke me, and I kinda realized now it was one of the reason why I did what I did. But anyway, after I broke up with my ex I started reevaluating my life. I realized that I can bury those feelings all I want, but I still love her. And after all those years I love her even more. I decided, that I should confess all my feelings to her. I was scared how she could react. I was scared if that will break up our longtime friendship. I was scared to lose one of the most important people in my life. But I realize that I had to do it. Because If I didn't know how she feels about me, it would eat me for the rest of my life. And frankly, it would be making and her a favor by confessing my feelings.

So, four days ago I told her I want to meet up with her and told her something important. We meet up at my place and basically told her the whole deal. I almost chickened out, but when I told her It felt like a huge stone just disappeared from my heart. I think I almost passed out.

Her reaction. At first, she thought it was a joke. Like, it was a while before she realized I was 100% serious. And once she realized that, she went completely berserk. Lots of screaming, lots of yelling, lots of crying, lots of cursing. I tried explaining her everything but she couldn't hear it. In her opinion, I lied to her for years, decades. That our whole friendship was a lie. I explained to her our friendship was 100% real all this years, and it was sincere. But I explained to her I can no longer live not knowing how she feels about me. So I asked her how she feels about me. Again, lots of screaming, yelling, crying etc but her answer was basically ""I don't know"" and ""You can't just drop a bomb on me like that"", and repeating that every 5 minutes. After an hour she told me she needs to think about it alone and left.

Three days ago, I got a text from her saying she wants to talk. This time at her place. I've never seen her so depressed as that day. It was like talking to a different person. The talk was mostly her repeating ""why didn't you tell about this sooner"", ""why now"" again and again. I told her I just have to be sure about her feelings towards me. After some time she finally told me that yes, she had feeling for me in the past. But since I never shown any interests toward her she assumed I didn't have any interests in her and treated this as friendship so she dropped it as well. I asked her if there's any chance for us. Her answer was ""I don't know"" ""maybe"" ""this is too much for me"". So I told her we can continue this conversation when she sorts her out if she needs more time. Two Days ago I get a call not from her, but her roommate. She told me she knows everything because she told her everything, and the she's been crying all day long ""because of me"". I called her if we can talk, but she told me she needs time. Then her another friend called me, and then it kinda stopped being a private matter.

Yesterday I get a message from her friend that she doesn't want to leave house and that she completely shut down. I asked her friends if I could talk to her but she told me that's not a good idea. I also got a call from her parents (yeah) asking me if all the stuff are true. I confirmed, they weren't happy about it, but they understand my decision. I knew her parents for a long time and they are great people.

And now Today, she finally texts and tell me she wants to talk. We talk, and I try to be more demanding this time. I told her I need to know if she has any feelings toward me. It took a while, but yes, she told me she still has some feelings toward me, and would like to at least try the relationship. When I was leaving, she told me to wait, and kissed me. It shocked me, and I could feel the awkwardness in the air. I left after that. This has never happened before, she might have kissed me on the cheeks or something in the past but nothing like that.

This comes to my question. What to do? Was that a good thing what I did? Does that thing has a future? I feel like today was a good thing, but I still feel doubts. I also feel very guilty, and over the past these days I felt like something bad was going to happen. Was her reaction good? Do I have to worry about her?

TL;DR: Confessed love to my best friend since we were kids. After I confessed her feelings for me she reacted strongly, said she needed time but after few days she told me she has feelings for me and kissed me. I don't know if I did the right thing, and what to do now.

I met jane doe in cs1010s during y1s1 for one of the supplementary classes as we were struggle for one of the assignment and needed help. Jane and i exchange no so that we can discuss on future assignments for this mod as it was hard... we grow close together partly cause we suffered through this mod together.  she was lovable and cute.. kept calling me her senpai and it feels good for someone smart and pretty as her to call me that. and i did help her alot for cs1010s in sem1 and ger in sem2... and gotten quite close to her.  she is also supportive and encouraging of me to keep doing my best in my studies.

Fast forward y2s1 where the problems begin. We had our fair share of bad group mates in the mods we took. So i decided to group with jane doe and 2 of my good friends for this mod called ges1021. The first few weeks. She seemed like a nice and sweet girl.. and she and my friends got along fine. BUT she began showing signs that she might like me. Like playfully poking me and leaning on my shoulder from time to time and i was atttacted to her because she a pretty girl with a  sweet and kind deposition. Since we were expected to make our own notes for ges1021, she started to rely on my notes and that where things went sour.

Six strikes too many.  Firstly, Jane Doe began acting strangely during SEP application week. Jane Doe disappeared on our group when we need to decide places to go . But you re werent there and ignored me texting you 5-6 times whether she like to go a place near her house for convenience. But Jane Doe told us that she were busy with cca and sep and couldnt even bother to come to a non webcast lecture. Secondly, Jane Doe didnt bother to study for the mod you choose and complain how my notes are unclear for you to understand and decide to text me 100 qn to prepare for your midterms. I helped cause im afraid you were lagging too behind. Thirdly, you demanded me to restructure the notes i send her and even ask me to highlight in red the comments the prof stress on... but i was too blind to see and i thought is normal to help a girl you adore so much.

Fourthly, when the ges1021 prof said we had to change the location used for our project Jane Doe was furious. I get that. But the moment Jane Doe acted like she knew better than the prof  that where i draw the line. Cause no matter how smart you are is pretty arrogant thinking you re better than her right? Fifthly, closer to the deadline i get that you re stress with your competition coming and your geh midterms incoming. But you didnt have to show poor attitude by being all sarcastic about losing a few marks for not using apa format when you just want me to do the work or how you used me to do the work needed to be done when you could have asked the group. We re in this together but Jane Doe seemed to look out for herself and pretend to contribute significantly. when the rest of the group done significantly more work than whay you did. And lastly, you told me to make use of my ue as mod that can help me in the future. When i planed my sep outline with her advice in mind hoping Jane Doe would be happy for me. But she just ignored me.. like im only worth a damn when you needed my notes which you are expected to craft yourself and that the final straw cause at that point im just exhausted and just gave up on her. 

Am i crazy?
The whole sem i try and try to chase her and extend my hand to jane doe. But it seem she only interested and exploting me cause im just too gullible. I thought is normal for a guy to chase after a girl. And i must be crazy for not thinking she cant be in the wrong and that she still a good person. But she had me wrapped round her finger for her use. But thanks to my friends who at least let me see reason i decided to block her on whatsapp cause the girl i know no longer there and there no point keeping in contact with somebody who only want my notes..

So to Jane Doe, you really played me like a fiddle. And the kind-hearted girl i know before me is dead in my eyes. You probably wont change.. but at the very least from the experience i learn that you should have the strength and courage to walk out from any toxic relationship with anyone who just out there to exploit.. it is hard but a necessary evil.. that you have to take for your own good.

Please try not to apply steroid creams even when dermatologists tell you to because it only suppresses the symptoms and does not treat the underlying cause. However, when you first stop your steroid intake, you'll probably experience what they call Topical Steroid Withdrawal. It's a horrible experience but it'll be alright after you go through this phase. To lessen the pain when you bathe, do not use the typical bath shampoo but use bath oil. For me, I use Oatmeal Bath Oil from Derma**** by applying it before I wet my body with water. It does help to lessen the pain from the open wounds.

I was also told that we have flare ups because there is something wrong with the body, like our liver is overworked while detoxifying our body. So one of the best ways to counter this is to have a cleaner diet by trying to abstain or lower your intake of certain foods which can trigger your eczema. Certain foods include high histamine food, night shades, dairy and nuts. Also try to avoid preservatives and processed foods.

Finally, if possible, get supplies of antihistamines like Zyrtec from a polyclinic to help with the itch (cold presses help too). Very cliche to say to stop scratching.. but it's really a need to break the scratch itch cycle that I still cannot do.. Now that NSC is conducting a clinical trial for a new drug, I hope it helps all of us eczema sufferers. :)

When asked about this issue, they always tell me that Indian guys like to date chinese girls and guys of other races dont like them either as Indians are not considered pretty. I dont understand this issue as they are definitely beautiful and fun individuals. Could someone enlighten me on this issue why dont people want to date Indian girls, they deserve so much more :( Guys of other races would you date Indians and Indian guy why do you prefer chinese girls.

941,"My gf of 4 years wants to break off with me. She has had enough of my priority with gym activities than spending quality time with her. 
We used to be so happily indulged in the gym activities together but she no longer has the stamina for them. 
I begged her 3,000 to stay with me, promising that i would cut down on the activities and duration. I know she's still loves me.
She finally relented and gives me one final chance on one condition: I just need to achieve her goals in the activities that i love doing. If i fail, she will start to download dating apps. 
Goals: 
1) Make 10 new friends. 
2) Catch 100 pikachus with 4 perfect iv. 
3) Catch 10 perfect narvitas.
4) Catch 10 different shiny. 
5) Lastly, to commemorate our 4th year of courtship, catch 7 legends with 96% or above iv. One legend from one continent.
I have 7 days starting 14Oct. 
Am i screwed?

942,"I found out my mother has been cheating on my father. 

I have since confronted my mother, who says that she intends to file for divorce as my father was 'emotionally unavailable'. I find this excuse pathetic, as he was a professional who worked long hours during his prime, and was probably on the verge of depression (ironically, his profession involves treating those with depression, among other things). 

She told me not to break the news to him first. It has been 6 months since the confrontation, and I have decided to cut all ties with my mother and her family (they encouraged her to do so, even going as far as to introduce her to that bastard guy - how else would you describe a man who knowingly and willingly pursues a married woman). I do not wish them well. She has yet to tell my father. 

I am worried she will try to take his assets during the divorce. I plan to tell my father. Hopefully, we can think of a way to prevent her from getting a single cent.

I am getting really frustrated doing all the booking and always at the receiving end for all their complaints.. what I hated most is when I asked for opinions and views, they always said anything.. But when I made a decision to book certain place, they made comments like “too budget.. too expensive”. Most hurtful is spending days and free time researching and thinking how to accommodate to people but having no one appreciating or having no one thinking for u.

Recently He came open to confess to me about a promise he broke. I feel that if I forgive him again he will just take advantage of it and hurt me again. So what should i do?

I have stuck with her throughout the 4 months persistently and she says im stupid for doing so, since most people would cut and run.
But it has come to a point where it's tiring to do so. 
Im tired. 
Tired of fighting so hard for someone who doesnt fight as hard for me.

I think i'm selfish for thinking that way. She's going through depression and yet here I am expecting her to put in effort into the relationship. 
I didnt bring this issue of me feeling like I wasnt getting anything out of the RS up to her for a couple of months because i knew she was going through stuff and I didnt want to add on to her burden.

I did my research online and understand that it's normal for people undergoing depression to feel this way sometimes. But it's hard to hold on to a relationship when the other party insists on breaking it off. And even harder when the reason behind it is because she thinks she cant provide me with the things a girlfriend provides because she has depression.


Recently she asked me why i wasnt sharing stuff with her, because i'd want her to share her problems with me, so we could work through it together.
So I finally did. I brought up the issue of me feeling like I wasnt getting anything out of the RS gently, but also didnt tell her because i knew she was going through stuff and I didnt want to add on to her burden.

And she broke down. Went back into this loop of wanting me to dump her. Either that or she would dump me.
I dont know why i'm still fighting so hard for her. Am i dumb to do so? 

I did insist on bringing her to see a counsellor recently after a recent severe suicidal episode.
All i want is for her to be happy again.
But a part of me is feeling really really tired at having to deal with all of this everytime. I tried so hard yet I feel i'm stuck at this same spot with her.
Should i let her go?

While everyone's wrapped up around the celebrations of the new year, I'm not sure if it's because I'm getting old but I've been reflecting a lot over the past few days. While I'm grateful I got through 2019 without encountering much harm or adversity, but I'm disappointed I've had no personal growth this year. While everyone around me is moving ahead, pursuing new interests and deepening their expertise, I've become more isolated and less driven than before, as it appears less and less likely I will ever be able to keep up. Nevertheless, I wanna change for 2020. I'm hoping to get some advice on what are things which have worked for you guys which might help someone like me to regain my confidence and focus?

First off, I didn't do very well in finals (Bs and B-s), plus to top it all off I missed the S/U deadline so pretty bummed out rn, any words of advice? I keep feeling that my intended major isn't for me and I should change majors/schools just so that I can start afresh, but i do hold much passion in the major (I just get depressed whenever I think of my prospects)
Second, i have serious body image issues regarding the scars I have. I've had them since secondary school and it always bothered me, but not to this extent. Ever since I got a bf and he pointed it out I've been feeling like I should get rid of it but the treatment and surgeries are expensive and I honestly do not know what to do

I feel as though my life is about to end when I know it's just started, but I'd say it might have to do with me having ... thoughts since young. 

Sorry for the long post, I just feel absolutely hopeless and really need some words of advice or encouragement rn.

He said I could leave to find a better guy if I wished. We are together for a year. I am more inclined to leave because I wanted a stable and healthy family if I were to settle down. Is it ethical for me to just leave him since he already given me ‘permission’? Anyone can advise what is the best way to approach this?

After a few hangouts, we became closer, held hands and went over to his place a few times. However, after I went home, I felt like he became less enthusiast on text. But whenever we met up, his actions shows otherwise. But we don't meet up that often because he is quite lazy. We often only meet to have dinner or supper every week, and just chill around. He told me he really liked me, and I told him back the same too. What I'm confuse is, whether is he playing me? Or is he actually serious with me? Because how he talks on text and behaves in real life feels different.

952,"Does height matter to girls? I am 162.7 cm and have been outright rejected by girls because of it. I have been on dates before but they usually end it after the second date and tell me they're not attracted to me because of my height. I take care of myself by going to the gym, maintaining a good GPA, learning the piano, playing sports and already have a job offer before graduating but all my achievements are diminished because of my height. My female friends and relatives have even told me that they wouldn't date someone my height ever.

During my internships in the CBD, I am easily the shortest male, barely at shoulder level of other males. Women without high heels are already taller than me, let alone those who wear them.

954,"In addition to the “target CAP” method when using SU options, which is what I use, I would also like to add that the popular belief that SU makes your base weaker is building on the “Scarcity Mindset“. It’s stressful and unnecessary.

In reality, a grade below your target honours class will pull your CAP down as much as an equivalent grade above the target class pulling your CAP up, regardless whether you use SU or not. For example, if you aim for Second Upper (4.0), getting a B is going to pull you down as much as a A- is going to pull you up, regardless of your base. Do the math if you don’t believe me.

In any given sem, it’s not like you are only taking one module whereby one bad grade is totally irreversible, most likely you have other mods to balance it out and you still can achieve your target. Live with the Abundance Mindset and be happy. 

Happy 2020 everyone.

I can’t help feeling this sense of insecurity that I might lost him but at the same time I felt that it’s too fast to really like someone as due to my past experience.

We are still friends. We talk almost everyday, with me initiating the conversation. However, due to the upcoming examinations, I havent been texting her for the past few days. Didnt expect her to initiate too, because she never did before. But just an hour ago, she wished me good luck for my exam on Tuesday. Im surprised, but also shocked, which left me thinking, does it actually mean anything or shes just treating me like a friend?
