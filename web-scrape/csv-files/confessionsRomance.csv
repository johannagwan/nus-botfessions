0,"It has been 2 years since we broke up and for the past 2 years i have tried to forget about it and moved on with my life. I got myself busy with work and seeked self-improvement. For some time, I didn't had any issues and able to commit myself into work and focus on life goals.

But for the past few days, all of the sudden I had flashbacks of the time when we were together and I can't seem to focus with my daily tasks and spent time thinking about it ..

How can I overcome this?

1,"I had a crush on a girl from computing last semester. I tried to sit close to her in every single lecture but didnt dare to approach her because i scared that she would find me creepy. Today, i saw her again in another lecture sitting with some other girls and sat right behind her. This time, i decided to talk to her after lecture. However, right after lecture, i saw her going off with another guy and my heart broke.

2,"Our story dates back to 2013, when 我的歌声里 was the #1 hit ,I was always there for you during your ups and downs; it was one-sided for nearly 5 years. When I thought you would eventually get married to him, I moved on. 

Just when I was about to start my love life, you contacted me. You were depressed and you needed me. I chose you without much hesitation, I just couldn't bear to leave you in that state. 
Perhaps, it was the cultural differences or my lack-of experience, I struggled to adapt. But I loved you more than anything else, including myself, I followed my instinct and did whatever I could to make you happy.

I knew it was a toxic relationship , but I ignored all the red flags and dove right into it. I forgave all your wrongdoings, I would make sure to sleep later than you, I would buy anything for you. I spent all my savings to maintain the relationship just because I couldn't bear to see you sad or upset. You were my everything. 

You never cared about my feelings, my happiness or my well-being.  The relationship was simply two person in love with one person. We had plans for marriage, but I knew I couldn't tolerate this for the rest of my life. I wanted you to change, but you just couldn't change. I wanted out.

After the break up, you used various ways to make me stay. I stayed, but you couldn't stand the changes. We broke up again. I knew a leopard would never change its spot. After the 3rd break-up I blocked you on every social media platform, it was only way for you to move on. 

Fast forward to today, it was a bittersweet moment seeing your post with your new boyfriend. I am glad that you are happy again, but I know I will never be the same.

I'm the owner of post #75073. 
I read through the comments and I really wanna thank those girls who shared their own dealings with insecurities and others, who reminded me of my self worth and the need to be confident again. He has not cheated andddd I should find some level of self-love again.

4,"I've been together with this guy for about half a year. At first I thought he was perfect for me, our values and future goals aligned well, and we have similar things we liked to do as well, which made it easy to talk and hang out. But the more we are together, the more I feel that we are incompatible after all. 

Though he does treat me well overall, I feel like he chose me for the sake of finding someone he could settle down with, instead of a partner he actually loves. I have asked him directly about this, which he neither confirmed nor denied, but gave a very roundabout answer which leads me to believe it is true. I know some people are okay with that and that's fine, but personally, a rs where you don't love your partner isn't quite for me. This made me super sad at first, but slowly that sadness is turning into annoyance somehow. We also tend to have a lot of misunderstanding when we talk about day to day stuff (I've never had such issue when communicating with any of my friends, or even any of the guys I used to date, but somehow we often have miscomms) , which is starting to get on my nerves sometimes. 

What makes breaking up difficult is that we have met each others families (which I now regret introducing him so early) and that he doesn't treat me badly per se. Should I just hold on and try for this or is there no point?

On the first day of school, I saw so many pretty girls from my course and felt so blessed since women were rare in Engineering. Fast forward to semester 2, I am still single and lonely... All the pretty girls who surround me seem to be either taken or disinterested, leaving me in the friendzone. Is it just me? My looks? My personality? I am 22 this year and still evergreen.

8,"Sorry in advance: long post to which I'm tearing to...I dont even know why but it's just a rush of past feelings. 

I've been with my boyfriend for about 6 years now. We have been good but the beginning was pretty hard...I thought I got better but the insecurities are coming back. 
*
A little background: He is verrryy good looking - albeit singaporean, people would often ask if he is local (don't know why the heck singaporeans don't think singaporean guys can be good looking) and compliment his looks. 
I'm average I would say, but definitely not model look material. But also, I had no qualms over his above average looks or this attention. Partly because I thought I was very secure (based on my past relationships) and thought this would be the same. He also chased me for quite a long period as I was initially not keen in a rhsp. 

Although, sometimes it stung a little - when we went out, people would compliment his looks. When we go to family gatherings, people would again compliment his looks. I get the compliments but sometimes I feel it's just for the sake of. And guys are not the only ones who would chase attached girls...I've had other girls try to squeeze their way into our relationship to get his attention (attempt to initiate physical contact in a sexual manner, text daily etc).

But I always reminded myself that we both have our strengths, I'm the brain of the relationship and have had charted a successful pathway for myself (I've helped him build his intelligence appetite largely too). But no one really sees that. Cause yes..looks win. 

And in the beginning of our relationship, he did give in to the attention from girls (reply their messages, flirt back) because it was new to him (coming from a boys school) and so I turned from being a super secure girl to a pretty insecure one. We had huge fights...and since then, I've always had this tiny insecurity streak in me. I let it go through lots of talk with him (he has drawn boundaries and have been loyal) and self reflection but I always have this doubt that he has a upper hand, and can, and MAY cheat. 

Presently...

He started working (he has always worked in a male dominated env) and not surprisingly, the attention has begun and girls have began throwing themselves at him. He used to be pretty naive & assumed this actions (from obviously interested girls) were not to lead him on but I'm a girl and I know. He has been telling me what they've been trying to do and his responses have been kept to a friendly manner but I just cant seem to trust him. He knows he is good looking and I'm afraid the attention gets to his head again and he starts to flirt back. I do feel disgusted at myself for being so insecure....but I'm so tired. 

I sometimes wish I wasn't dating such a good looking person because it makes feel like shit about myself and I feel that I'm not strong enough to deal with the shit that comes with it. All the thoughts and what ifs...should I just end it? 

Has anyone had a similar experience? How do you deal with it? I'm really hoping to salvage this relationship before my insecurities build again...because I foresee this to be a long term issue.

11,"Its been 12 years since we first met. The first time I saw you, I froze for a few seconds just thinking of what an angel you were and how happy I would to just be your friend. You were absolutely perfect and honestly, out of my league. 

As months past, we got closer and began hanging out on our own. Somehow you started coming to my house and spending time with me despite your ridiculously tight schedule. I thought you were just fooling around and so I didn't put my all into it. I was always half hearted for I feared of getting myself burnt infront of a ""too good to be true"" perfect mate. 

I guess you grew tired of waiting and hinting, that over the years we each met our current partners. I told you I missed you then but I guess it was too late. It's been 4/3 years since each of us got married respectively but not a single day has passed for me without thinking of you. 

I love my current partner and am responsible for our marriage and will not do anything to jeopardize it, but my heart still yearns for you every day, every minute, uncontrollably. I hope you have found your 100% happiness with your partner and will never look back.

14,"OK so I have a confession to make.
I am in love with my close female friend.
I know she doesn't like me, so how do I stop liking her?

I can't stop thinking about her. It wasn't like this at the start. I've known her for 2 years, and we've been talking to and playing games together almost every night. I used to have no interest in her, and she had no interest in me. But, sometimes I get mixed signals. She does something that makes my heart beat damn badly.
But I don't think she likes me. And I want to know what to do. She has been a great friend, and I don't want to ruin the current friendship we have, that we can talk to each other about tons of different things, and we have the same interest and common topics. She feels the closest to me in the group and I feel that way to. I don't want my feelings to get in the way of the friendship. Any advice from my NUS peeps on how to kill this love?

I don’t know if anybody can relate, but I feel like the ugly friend all the time. This is not one of those whiny “I’m so ugly” posts. I’m an average-looking girl who is occasionally complimented on my appearance, and I’ve had guys confess to me before. 

But when I hang out with my friends, somehow I don’t get noticed. I’m aware that my friends are cute and pretty, but it’s amazing how I instantly get ignored by the opposite gender the moment I stand next to them. The moment we separate, I start to get more attention from guys. Why is this so? Am I just slightly attractive, but ugly compared to my friends?

17,"Dear guy
We decided to end this relationship. No, i think u decided to end it before i did. It doesn't matter anymore. You gave up too early, way too early. That made me sad. I was ready to keep trying as long as you are sure about me. But i could feel that you wasn't. All those harsh words u said to me. I thought u were only joking and that u didn't meant it. Only now did i realise that you had wanted to end it long ago, but u continued because u feared that i would be sad, because you saw how happy i was. I had seen u being happy with me. Was that a lie?

Have you seen the effort i put in, to try make you happy? I buy small stuff for you to show my support as you get through the tough and long hours of work. If i could, i would have cook or made something for you. I try not to complain or show negativity because I know how draining it gets when one is tired. When you are sick, all i wanted is to see you to ensure you are really okay. How many times have i boarded the train to your station, only to turn back because I knew you wouldn't have wanted me to do so. I brought you to meet my friends because i want you to feel assured that i wanted a future with you. How i wished we had more chance to have double dates. I took time out to meet you even though i was so tired and not feeling well. How many times did i crash in my bed the moment i settled down at home and yet i sounded so energetic in my texts? How many times do you know i was unwell and stressing to get myself well again so that we could meet as agreed? How many times did i thank you because i was afraid you would think that I'm taking you for granted. 

But how many times did you appreciate what i did for you? How many times did you encourage me when i felt like giving up.

All these because I want you to feel loved. But I didn't know what i need to do to make you happy. So i tried every possible ways i could think of. 
How many times did i reach out to you to communicate with me. All you did was to crack some jokes or change the topic to ignore my question. How much i wish to know more of your world and what you have been through - the good the bad and the things you did - the good and the bad. 

We both lost in this relationship. We lost to communication. 

And then it came to me that the best way to make you happy is to end this, no matter how much i didn't want to. I need to set you free. 

Maybe you were also disappointed in me in some way. But that i will never know. I'm sorry. I love you.

Like I enjoy being with her and all, but it just feels like this relationship will not last because we don't have much conversation topics and it just feels like there's no chemistry? She is very lovely, and has some ideal characteristics I would love to see in my future wife. But it just feels like something is missing. She gives in to me alot and I just feel like I owe her so much. And I just feel like she's surrounded by so many more guys who can better take care of her than me. and I just don't see why she is still with me. She seems to get along well with her friends (guys and girls), but then we just don't seem to have much chemistry. She seems to be so happy with others, and with me I just don't think I make her as happy as others do. Idk, it feels like I'm just waiting for the day when she realises that this rs is going nowhere and for her to break up with me then. I like her, but something feels off. I dw to hurt her. I did tell her that I wish some things between us can change, and I don't see it changing. Idk how I can change to make this rs last. 80% of the time I don't think this rs will last, but that 20% of the time when I see her in my future, makes me want to fight for this rs.

25,"Dear you,

I thought we were progressing pretty well, chatting and meeting up so often, always sharing about our days and complaining about our problems. I'm sure you already know I like you, I've been explicit. But your responses are so mixed it's giving me hope only to constantly pull them away again. I know you try to be friendly to everyone, but many of your actions to me are different and could mean so much more. Of course I have wool over my eyes. 

Then I realised you had the ""habit"" of sometimes replying halfway, and sometimes not even checking our chat even though you're always online. I was blindly infatuated and just ignored it once, twice, many times. But communication is my love language, I felt that I was putting in all the effort maintaining the conversations.

I'm sure you didn't notice, but I've started to pull back, to reread our conversations and realise that most of the time it's just me initiating, you only doing so rarely. Days without replying even though you read the msg, then replying like it's nothing. Or replying on another app. 


I kept painting a picture to my friends that hey maybe you are the one. But now I have to take care of myself first. I really love you, but chat after chat you're just not putting in as much effort in conversations as I hope you would. 

Maybe it's time I move on. You don't owe me anything anyway, since we didn't go official. Have I already fell to the friendzone without even knowing? I hate that you feel bad for ignoring people, even those you friendzoned, yet you ignore me then replying like nothing happened.

I hate that I still want to give you more chances, because I keep lying to myself even though I already know the answer.

26,"To the guy that broke my heart:
Honestly,  I really believed that we would one day be married. 

When you forgot my birthday, I thought it was because it was you being absentminded with dates. Who knew that you would break up with me within the month? 

When you didn't seem very excited about the present I got you on your birthday, I thought it was stress from work. Who knew that you would break up with me just a mere 2 days later? 

When you were an hour late for our meet up, I thought it was just you having fun with your friends. Who knew that you would break up with me that day? 

When you told me you were troubled and asked for my advice, I thought it was you trying to work things out with me. Who knew that you would break up with me within the hour? 

So many red flags and well, I blame myself for not noticing them earlier. 

The reason you gave for the break up was vague - you needed space, you needed time.

Fast forward 2 months later, you're ignoring me on every platform possible, not even replying my new year wishes. I guess that's the end of the relationship then. Goodbye, and good luck.

I didn't get the closure I needed and will be picking up the pieces you left behind, but with this post, I'll finally let you go. I wish you all the best.

27,"Went to Jewel Coffee to buy a latte. While lining up, someone tapped on my shoulder from behind, it was a guy with a beautiful girl besides him. I didn’t recognised the guy at first until I asked him if I knew him. He mentioned his name and introduced the girl besides him as his gf, suddenly the world dark for a while. He’s a guy from the same jc as me and he was my best friend. The fact that I forgot about him bcoz something had happened during college time. We were in the same water polo team and went for quite a number of tournaments. To make it fast forward, we were about to go on our own path, I ended up in NUS while he went to oversea to study.

Few days before he fly, he stayed at my home, had a few drinks, talked a lot on sports and out of nowhere, we ended up staring at each other. It was the time where I do realised he is such a fine guy, perhaps the most good looking guy I had ever seen that time. The fact that I never had a feelings to any guys but I don’t even know why he came into me. The basorexic feelings killing me, staring at his luscious lips, moving away my sight immediately after.

Out of sudden, his hand pulling my neck and brought my face near to his, ended up kissing each other. His lips so soft that I don’t even want to cut the kiss. We ended up cuddled on my bed while he was kissing me hardly. I never knew that the raging hormone of this young guy so strong. Maybe because we were drunk at that time but the fact that I able to remember each moment until now, I don’t think I am. We never talked about that night since then and we ended up losing in contact after.

Back to present, I was immersed in those memories until he called me by my name and asked me whether I am okay. I am okay after all these years without him. He asked me why I never in contact with him all these while and I don’t even know how to answer it. ‘It is good to see you, it has been a while’. It was an awkward short conversation, he was the one who is excited and I am blunt as always. We never talked about past time as I don’t want to think about it anymore. The fact that he is having a gf now, it is time for him to be happy. 

I ended up ordered my drink and sat somewhere else. He and his gf sat quite far from my table. Suddenly, a waiter came to me and handed a plate of croissant. I never ordered it but the waiter told me that the guy in white shirt ordered for me, He is my friend from earlier on and I looked at him from far, he looked at me and gave me a good smile. The waiter handed me together with a small notes given by my friend.

It was sort of our honeymoon period and he had to enlist recently. While I'm feeling a sudden sense of emptiness during this transition phase, I believe he is having a tougher time inside. With the limited texting we have, I am a bit lost on what can I do or say to encourage and support him throughout. I kind of realised there's nothing much I can do to help.

Furthermore, I am not expecting him to spend all of his book-out time with me as he will probably be tired, need to rest, get some me-time or spend it with his friends or family. Hence, I'm thinking of just having a shorter, non-strenuous date like a simple bonding over meal, but will this get mundane overtime?

Any advice on how to cope with this transition is very much appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Sometimes he plans dates on the day itself. If he wants to genuinely ask me out, he would have plan a day before at the very least? Or it is normal? 

He always avoids answering directly to my questions as well... 

I recently also found out that he has been hanging out with a group of girls which he has never spoken to me before. He has never mentioned to me before when I asked him how was his day and what he did for the day. When i questioned him, he says he never thought that it is something he would need to report to me. He says it is after project group works where they will hangout after.

I will get mad everytime but after he dismisses my thoughts, I will let it go. Am I living in denial? Is he cheating?

Whenever I hear my friends talking about how they are planning their future with their partners, I realised we have never discuss about our future before.

Have I met a player or is this trust issues?

I feel that it depends on the frequency of his demands. Say if it’s once a week or less, what do you want him to do about it? Will you be okay if he gets his fix from someone else? If it’s every other day, then the comments got me covered in your post. Good day to you.

40,"@ The OP of #74787 :
Honestly, it sounds like the girl has lost interest in you. Either that, or she’s the type of girl (I’d know well, being one myself) who likes the chase. When you meet someone new, they are completely foreign and mysterious to you. It’s thrilling and exciting to talk to them. However, after a while, they become familiar to you and the excitement is gone. This is especially so if she had realised on some level that you already have feelings for her. 

My advice to you: Stop texting her and being at her beck and call. Don’t initiate any conversations or plans with her, but don’t completely ice her out if she makes a move on you. Simply put, only talk to her if she’s the one who talks to you first. Maybe get to know some other girls or at least make yourself look busy. Good luck!

41,"I have a problem with my girlfriend and am unsure whether to break up. See, we have been together for some time and it was rather smooth sailing. However lately, she started getting paranoid about lying after seeing some of her cousins’ relationships wrecked because of lying. She even demanded that whoever caught lying in our relationship will be fined by the other person. To reassure her, I agreed.

Then for some ridiculous reasons, she started fining me a few times for “lying”. The most ridiculous fine was when I blurted out during an argument that she spent more time meeting her good guy friends than meeting me. She said I was lying because I didn’t take into account the other time she spent thinking about me but choosing to compare only the time physically meeting. 

I was incensed and demanded that she give me a breakdown on how much time she spent thinking about her good guy friends compared to that spent thinking about me. At this point she said she can give me the breakdown, but she counter-questioned me about my intentions for asking and implied that I don’t trust her even though she always has my back blah blah blah. She still refuses to give the breakdown. 

Should I get out of this relationship? I know I probably still have value on the dating market because some other girl has persistently pursued me (but she has money management issues). But after all, my gf and I have been together for some time and we are familiar with each other. I would rate our rs as a 7/10, but her increasingly paranoid and controlling manner is making me reconsider. Should I break up with her?

43,"22 Male here.
I broke up a few months ago with my girlfriend of 6 months. It was me who broke it off knowing she wasn't the right person for me in the long run (it started getting too serious too soon). Her bestfriend somehow got into middle of this and confessed his love for her. I tried to give her space to figure things out but eventually decided that it wasn't worth it and broke up with her.
It was an ugly breakup even though I tried to keep it very straightforward. 
We blocked each other almost everywhere. However, now I know for a fact that both of them are together and it boils my blood. 
They jumped into the relationship just right after we broke up even though she used to tell me she never looked at him that way and never imagined being together with him. 
I would have been fine with it if it was someone else but knowing that she is with the guy who was somewhat a reason for our breakup makes me really mad. I keep getting these wild thoughts to ruin their relationship in some way or the other. 
I feel guilty for feeling that way. I thought I had moved on but the fact that it still bothers me knowing they are together, sleeping together says otherwise.
Obviously it must have been very easy for her to move on jumping from one relationship to other but it has been somewhat hard for me. 
I'm well surrounded with loving friends and family. Also I keep myself busy for most days with work. But the nights are the hardest. 

I keep switching to another IG account I created where I am following her to check her and that guy's post or stories. I know I should delete that account and try to move on but I just can't get myself to do it. 

Can someone share some advice. I really want to move on and leave both of them in the past.

44,"Dear Prof Ben and NUSWhispers community,

TLDR; Girl I like seemed to like me back during school term. Ghosted me during vacation. I don't think she's the kind that would use me but who knows. I want to continue whatever we had. Might be awkward if I want but she doesn't. I'm lost. How should I treat her or go about this tactfully? Even just as friends? 

There's this girl that I really like and have been helping her for homework during the semester. We were very close. She was not rejecting my romantic advances, and sometimes even reciprocating. It seemed mutual. I thought we had a thing but it turns out she just completely ghosted me during the vacation. 

We were so close during the semester. I don't understand why she ghosted me. But maybe something happened or maybe she's just not in the mood? To be fair it could have been something I did that made her decide I don't want this guy. Looking back I realise I haven't really showed her feel loved in the way she wanted despite her hints. Maybe I should be understanding and give her the benefit of doubt. She seemed very genuine during the semester. Not like the kind of girl with a motive. 

But right now when I try to talk to her she'll seem cold and uninterested. We used to talk every day. Now she's not initiating convos and when I do, she'll give me one word replies. She seems like she doesn't want this anymore.

Sometimes it makes me feel like I'm just being annoying and I trying to talk to her is just pestering her. It feels stupid trying to talk to her when she doesn't want to talk. I don't know what happened or if it's something I did wrong. 

There'll prob be a lot of comments telling me to 'ditch her, u just got used' and everything but please don't. 

I still want this relationship (or friendship) and I treasure her as a person. I like her a lot. and there's the possibility that she's just going through something. I just don't want to assume that this is over cause it might not be. 

Right now, I don't know how to continue this 'relationship'. It's hard to continue when the other person is making it feel 'one-way' even tho it used not be. And it's hard to let her know how I feel or ask her directly since we are not exactly boyfriend girlfriend. I just hope that this is a misunderstanding and it'll all work out eventually. What should I do? How do I get things to be like the way it used to. How should I treat her or go about this tactfully? Even just as friends?

But in the past, what our parents or grandparents learnt is how to fix it, rather than just throw it away and 'buy' a new relationship. If you have been approaching it wrong, it shouldn't be 'you don't deserve him or her', but 'let's work and see how you can change'. We are all work in progress, and the same goes for our partners.

Thus far, our convo is centred mostly on our daily lives and some random stuff, which is ok. But recently, I realized that the convo is focusing more on me only (as in he would ask me about stuff and I would answer, and this goes on and on).

He admitted that he is an introvert and a very slow texter (takes many hours to reply) - which I'm completely fine with and I choose to believe his words.

But I'm just wondering if he is at least a little interested in me (hence he still keeps the convo going even with the not-so-active/delayed responses), or am I like just a side option to him (maybe as a chat buddy)? Thus far, I have a relatively positive impression of him, and it seems like he is quite honest and upright (general impression I get through texts). Do you guys see a future in this relationship? Or is it still too early to tell? If yes, what should I do to continue this? If not, then maybe I should just stop the conversation once and for all.

I've always had a general impression that ppl on dating sites show their preferences quite quickly (like they will stop the convo if they are not interested), but this is something different so I'm unsure what to do.

Honest opinions much appreciated, thanks!

82,"On Christmas day, I went on a 2nd date with a guy I met on tinder. We met for lunch, then did some window shopping. At 2pm he suggested catching a movie, but when we checked out GV, there was nothing we fancied. Then he suggested that we Netflix at his place (a few bus stops away from the mall we were at).
We watched 2 movies from 3-7pm, then abit nua so we ordered Grabfood. After dinner, we caught another show from 8-10pm. Throughout the 3 movies, we were together under the blanket on his single bed. It was cozy and it did not feel awkward, felt super comfy to be very honest. At 10++ we had enough of movies and proceeded to lie down and cuddle. 
Things got heated and we went to 3rd base really quickly after making out. However after around 1hr(?) for some reason he was clearly very hesitant and said something like this ""I have been hard for very long and I really want to do it with you. But I think it is better to wait till we are together, not now when things are still ambiguous. Idw to take advantage of you."" 
Woah I was quite taken aback. Though it was indeed anti-climax, and a little traditional, but I guess it shows that he is someone with self-control and serious about this? Not sure... any thoughts guys?

84,"To OP of #74148. My boyfriend (soon-to-be husband) likes to ask for armpit scratches from me, and subsequently sniffing my fingers. Occasionally he will ask me to take a whiff too. On days when I feel brave, I do. It's funny how when it's your armpit, you can tolerate the smell but if it is other people's armpit, it stinks as hell.

Sometimes, I attempt to catch my fart when it comes out, and hold that space of air and quickly place it near his nose so that he gets the full smelly impact.

I guess, we are two lucky souls who managed to find each other on the same weird wavelength. I can see how to other people, they would find our behaviour awfully weird though. For you, dear OP and your significant other, you'll just need to work out both your tolerance levels for what is weird and what isn't. :)

86,"Just wanna share my story.

I was with my ex boyfriend for 1.5 years and I loved him very much. I put in all my effort, treated him very well and yet he talked to another girl pretty flirtatiously (in my opinion). I wouldn’t consider it cheating now that I have reflected on our relationship. But he didn’t respect me/my boundaries when I pointed out that I was uncomfortable with him talking to this particular girl. He continued talking to her after we broke up and subsequently asked her out.

I don’t want to pin the blame on him, I too have my weak points. What’s done is done and I have to keep moving forward no matter how hard it is. 

Maybe he just wasn’t ready to be in a relationship. I’ve come to realise that you will never be good enough for a man who isn’t ready to commit. And that’s fine, everyone is on their own journey. I hope one day I’ll meet someone who’d put in the same effort as I do, but until then I’ll work on bettering myself for the right man.

To all the singles out there, don’t rush into love (like I did). Love will come eventually :)

Me and my ex boyfriend (both alumni bunch) broke off almost two years ago and we were from different racial and ethnic backgrounds (I am a chinese and he is Indian). The reason why we broke off is due to our familial and cultural differences. Basically my parents did not want me marrying or being in a relationship with a non chinese guy and his family did not want him marrying a non Indian girl either. We came to a mutual understanding and broke off the relationship because of the familial differences and needs. Fast forward two years and I have realized that it was the stupidest thing to have ever done because it was almost a perfect relationship that we had. I'm not sure if it's too late to even get back together now. I just want to put it out there, since I have witnessed many posts about couples going through cultural differences on this page.... that if you are facing any cultural/racial/religious differences in your relationship which your family does not approve of or could be an impediment...please fight for it if you truly value it...because it may pay off in the longer run. Sacrificing your relationship for your family's 'ideological needs' may seem like the smarter move at the moment.... but trust me it's not..

91,"hi, had to get this off my chest. I have been attached for 4 years in uni and i love my girlfriend dearly. As my girlfriend is quite sensitive, i have actively avoided interacting closely with any girls for the past 3 years. Add this with my 2 years of NS and its been 6 years since I actually talk or interact properly with any girls. 

Recently, I met a girl friend of mine one-on-one to pass her some lights that she told me she needed for Christmas. I offered to travel to her place since I was free that day. When I reached her place, she had made lunch for me and invited me to chill around. I found the gesture really sweet and at that moment, for the first time, I thought she looked really cute and sweet (I have no idea why I never noticed this despite knowing her for 7 years already). 

we had lunch and ice cream for desert (it was sorbet and i wasn't really a fan) and then we just sat on her sofa and chit chatted for around an hour. 
sorry to disappoint any readers but no we didn't do anything, but ever since that day which was around a week ago, I keep thinking about her even though I've been trying to block it out. 

I can't tell if this counts as cheating and if its because because I am very inexperienced with girls and fell into infatuation easily but I've been feeling really guilty to my girlfriend and trying to spend more time with her since its the holidays now as well. 

I've always despised cheaters but now i'm really afraid i am emotionally cheating, although I haven't texted the other girl since then. Does this count as emotional cheating? What do you guys advice I do?

I chanced upon conversations, obscene pictures and interactions with multiple girls. Basically he cheated. So he begged for my forgiveness after finding out that I knew, and asked me for another chance. I forgave him very easily to be honest, I thought that he would change. Fast forward to today, I know it’s wrong to check his phone but I just wanted to find out if he has actually changed, so I did. To my horror, he was messaging different girls on Instagram flirting and asking them for their telegram handles. So I checked his telegram too, and apparently he archived many conversations with different girls, muting them so that I’d never find out. Their conversations were so flirty, definitely not between two normal friends. My boyfriend and I went to watch Star Wars with my family last Saturday. And he claimed to the girls that he watched alone? Why is he trying to hide? Furthermore, he complained about me to them, without letting them know the context that he actually cheated on me. Now I’m like the bad guy. What should I do now? He don’t know I’ve checked his phone, though it was wrong, but it’s probably a blessing in disguise. Things will never change huh?

97,"I'm not sure if I should break up with my boyfriend of 7 years. We were together since we were in Secondary 3. You would just look at me and smile at me in class!!! Urghhhh. Sometimes, we would even eat lunch together, or hang out and chill at Lot 1 after school. Even though we were in different CCAs, we still managed to spend time with each other. We hid our relationship from our parents cause we knew they were against our relationship. Only our schoolmates and probably teachers knew about us and everyone thought that we were so cute together. They even thought that our relationship would last.

Then came JC. Both of us agreed to enter the same JC and went on to SAJC together. We took different combinations and only had same lecture and tutorials for Maths, Chemistry and Physics.  Still remember the time you bought me an exam welfare pack before A levels to wish me all the best! That's super cute and I super adore you. We had more arguments than usual especially in JC, but I don't blame you since both of us are feeling the pressure to do well in JC and go to a good school together in NUS. Eventually we managed to get through it and graduate from SAJC together. 

You got a higher score than me for A levels and you went to Business and Accountancy while I settled for Mechanical engineering. Due to the difference in courses, we spent less time together as our timetables clashed and it's not feasible to just walk to each other's school just to meet up for lunch. You usually spend your time with your clique instead of meeting me to go home together. How I wish both of us were staying on campus so that we can meet up more often. It's like things changed ever since we entered university. You claimed that you were busy on weekends trying to finish up your tutorials and understanding the lecture but half the time your Instagram stories show that you are outside with your clique! Because of this we started arguing and we started to talk less. 

We haven't talked for about a week and I'm not sure what to do. Should I message him first and talk to him and clear the doubts, and try to be understanding towards him? I mean it's the holidays, we all know that there is no work to do during the holidays but he hasn't been talking to me much ever since the end of the examinations.

But anyway, it's the end of Year 1 Sem 1 for both of us. Results are coming out real soon and I hope that you read this message and score really well, as it's your dream to get a GPA of at least 4.5!!

Hope things will go back to the things they were, especially the times when we were in NS where we usually meet up on the weekends to talk and chill :)

I've been told I look quite good so over the years I hooked up with a few pretty girls and we've been friends with benefits, meeting up every week or so. They are always so eager to show affection and to be honest I find them a little too clingy. I always treat them very well and since my family is pretty well-off, I pay for most of our outings and even the hotels when we didn't have any place.

Anyway, I try to show them that we are just casual friends (when they ask me about serious topics like what we are, I reply saying that we are still young and should discuss this in the future). But now, most of them are graduating and I feel like they are pressuring me to marry or propose to them. Two of them even asked me to meet their family during the next Chinese New Year and there's a real crazy one. Initially she started stalking me, but recently she even claimed that she's pregnant and wants me to go to the doctor with her. Obviously I ignored and blocked her number.

I'm genuinely perplexed, I understand that Chinese girls are more traditional in ""that"" aspect, but what are they even expecting from me?? To me it's just about mutual enjoyment, having a good time but apparently they don't feel the same way. I guess you can't even treat a girl nice without them catching some sort of feelings.

We've been together for a while, soon to be two years, but I'm starting to take him seriously now and it kind of freaks me out that I don't really trust him and I feel like I should verbalize this to him but I'm not sure how I should do it.

Or I lose my jobs ((I'm not working yet, still in uni but he is)). I also feel like he would be the kind of person who would leave the minute we have a major disagreement (everything has been smooth sailing so far, he's very chill and I'm very tolerant). I know it feels unfair to assume the worst of someone but how do I know that he's not going to flake out on me? We've been blessed enough to not be put through any major trials or tribulations but that does make me worry that he's not ""man enough"" to handle them when they inevitably come. 

He has this whole air of ""If you're not happy, leave."" Am I an asshole for feeling that he's not reliable at all?

A part of me feels that marrying a person like that is just asking for trouble even though he's been great in every other aspect so far - yet is asking for reassurance in this area bad? Even if I tell him this, what can he do to prove that he's going to stick around? Or what can I do to reassure myself?

We've been together for a year and I know him for 2 years. In the two years, he has gone out for dinner 3x with a JC friend, once with a pri sch friend, once with a cousin. That's it. I open his WA and I'm the only one who texts him regularly apart from his parents and siblings.

As a 25 year old guy, I expect you to have some people around you. Relatives, cousins, friends, someone! I'm an introvert too but I find him extreme. He works out by himself everyday, watches football, plays FIFA. I've asked him to at least watch football at a coffeeshop so you are around people, find some football fans online so you can talk to people. He can go weeks without anyone other than me and his fam talking to him. I couldn't stand it. I broke up.

How did he manage to get a gf then? He had so much time on his hands that he was always there for me, every impromptu lunch, every text at whatever time, he replied, he showed up.

Now, I'm moving on with my life but I'm worried for him. He refuses to change himself, he says he likes stability and is working on himself. But you won't grow just by being alone. You grow by talking, sharing, giving and being surrounded by people.

I asked him, ""Have you felt happy in the recent few years?""
He replied, ""No. I feel peaceful and that's enough for me.""

Loneliness is very difficult. I'm worried for him maybe because of guilt but idk what to do for him.

112,"There is something which I would love to get off my chest and rant about, not a troll post here, I would love to get some advice comments about this. No hateful comments here please :(  Sorry for my not-so-fluent english. 

Long rant ahead.. 

Story 1:

My bf (25y) and I (19y) have been together for close to 3 years. However, something that he have done recently made me doubt our rsl. 

One day when he came home from work he was 'not being the usual him' and was talking to me 'in a very nice way' (?) I knew him for 4 years so I could tell if he was hiding from me something/ did something guilty. Immediately i felt something was wrong. I know its wrong to check his phone without asking for his permission first but i just cant hold back my curiousness anymore. 

Long story short i checked his phone when he is not around and caught him sexting another gaming girl. My heart was literally aching and I teared up when I saw the conversation. Well based on the conversation on this gaming app i saw, he asked the girl for 'pics', but the girl apparently said she was too tired. The short conversation ended just right there, but before that there were afew phone calls made between them, so this could have happen long time ago without me knowing.

This has happened before, not sexting but cheesy way of talking to other girls online. Trust me, I have confronted him countless times and we 'had that talk before'. I ended up giving myself another chance/hope to forgive him and that it would not happen again. However, i thought that this has gone too far. 

I apologised to him first for looking at his phone without his permission, then confronted him about it and he said he was not hiding it from me (he had password on his phone and i unlocked it to check). He thought it was ok to sext with me knowing? He said he is not hiding anything as he said IT IS SIMILAR TO WATCHING P**N ONLINE ?!? LIKE HOW??! He said as long he's not showing any of his pictures to the other party it does not count as sext?!?! CAN SOMEONE PLEASE ENLIGHTEN ON THIS?!? Am i right or his right on this?!? Instead of showing any remorse, he kinda said that it is normal??!? to do it ??! Obviously i was pissed off and ignore him when he tried to coaxed me the entire night. He asked me if I still want him or not and I said Idk. 

Long story short, I still forgive him the next day because he promised me that he would not do it again. Am I being too nice to forgive him?  He cried and told me he would change and he wants to marry and have a family with me next time... we have spend so much time together and I do not want to leave him as well :( On the other hand, I kinda felt that I was being guilt trip to forgive him... 

Now Im lying on the bed while typing this, doubting my whole rsl with him every night, I am trying my best to trust him but I cry in bed silently at night with him beside me whenever I remembered what happen. I spend some nights at his house with him). I have never felt so self conscious and heart-broken after it happened :( 

Story 2: 

I guess many of you experienced the after-honeymoon period phase after a relationship. I felt like my relationship with him it getting more ""awkward"" as time passes by. We have lesser/nothing to talk about in real life/in text. Trust me I have suggested to go out to try new food/activities, but idk why but it just feels sooooo awkward to me. I feel like we are just sticking together just because we have no one else? I am feeling so tired in this relationship and i felt like we just so used to each other? Sometimes when i try to make conversations with him he just seems disinterested and gives me short reply. I love texting and I used to love texting him, ever since his reply have gotten cold, i have stopped. How i wish he would text me frequently :( 

Sigh I am getting so tired in this relationship, I have though of breaking up... I think me and him would be better off as friends? (I only have a few friends, and they are really busy with school/work, this is the reason why i was reluctant to break up with him, I was afraid to be alone). 

His family loves me so much, especially his mom who treats me so well, I can't bear to leave them :( 
To note, My bf does not mistreats me in anyway, he often buys me food i love and things i like for special occasions. I do the same to him too. 

Well I guess i will end my rant here.

To OP's bf (not sure if you will read this post) / to interracial couples who face the same issue :

You need to figure out what you really want at the end of the day. If you want to be her life partner, fight for it then. Sometimes you need to learn to compromise in life, in exchange for lifetime happiness. 

If you are in her shoes, would you choose to convert out just for her? Please think from her position too. She has been living in non halal way for decades and you are now expecting her to convert. Please be fair to her. Since you can accept her being non chinese in the first, why cant you accept her for being non muslim? I believe you would not want to lose her because of religion, right? I understand that this is tough but be brave enough to find the life you want and courageous enough to chase it. If you lose her now, i do not know when you can meet someone you love and someone who love you back.

I was in your position before and i chose to respect my chinese wife' decision for not converting. We are now living happily for 6 years. At home, everything is halal. However, i respect her for eating non halal food when we are outside the house. As for my child, he follows my surname and is a free thinker. We will let him to choose his own religion when he grows up. All religions are the same. It teaches us to be a better person and to respect others.

117,"Hi, Im a introvert, nus first year. So basically I like to play video games I kinda nerdy and also happen to have a boyfriend but he gets jealous really easily.

So recently I started making bunch of new friends(mainly guys due to my nature) and I started hanging up with them in terms of like just play video games and chit chat.

So after awhile My boyfriend started getting so pissed because I started spending significant less time with him and he wants me to stop spending so much time with them. okay, fair, so I tried to squeeze some time for him and instead of playing with my friends and messaging them as often. I cut down a little and started to commit more and gave him a little bit more time but when I gave him more time he just wants even more. 

I just feel really stressed. Why can’t I just play with my friends more? Why can’t he be understanding? Sometime I just feel so controlled and stressful. 

Ik it’s unfair for him that I spend more time with other guys but it’s mainly messaging and sometime video games only and because of that.. sometime he asked what am I doing. I will just lied to him and say I’m doing nothing Or YouTube just because idw him to feel jealous. Am I wrong? What am I suppose to do?

My boyfriend and I are(?) together for a little over one year. We were doing well and all but I have never been able to tell him the things that I disliked about him; especially his behaviour and the way the treats me. But recently, I kinda snapped and dropped him a huge bomb of things that I have disliked about him. He took it quite negatively(he claims that I am tired of him???) and tbh I was hoping he would take the initiative to change his behaviour(he always scold me and rely on me on the the daily basis, literally. Felt more like his maid than his gf) because I really love him alot. But he said he refused to change because that is the way he is and he like himself that way. I was hoping that I was enough for him to change.. I am his first girlfriend and there are definitely many times where I felt love and appreciation from him. I tried to be an understanding girlfriend. Maybe my expectations were too high? Oh and he misunderstood that I am getting tired of him because I said that I was tired of his behaviour and the way he treats me. And he never ever admit his own mistakes, it is always me who apologised first. Moreover, he really sometimes give others bad impression of me because of the things he say about me in front of other people. If I were to tell him about his mistake, he would retaliate and push the blame to me instead. But nonetheless, he is pretty selfish and self centered at times but he have never failed to show me love in his own ways until recently. Honestly as I type this confession, I feel like he is a pretty shitty boyfriend but everyone is not perfect. I am sure I am not a perfect girlfriend either. 

Anyhow, as I've said he took things negatively, we 'broke up'. I was a sore loser and I couldn't let him go because he is really my partner and lover. I begged and cried for one more chance. Somehow I got that chance, but recently he told me that he is unsure of his feelings for me ever since that day I took my stuffs back and walked out of the house. So we decided to take a break and I want to give him some time(since he said that he needs time to get hold of his feelings for me again). 

I don't think it was wrong of me to express my feelings but it took a negative turn in our relationship. Do you guys think there is still a chance of rekindling our bond? I really don't want to stress him but I really miss him and the way we were last time. Is there any way that I can make him feel better? I feel sad and it really hurt me when he said he is unable to tell whether he still have feelings for me.. even I can't feel the love anymore. Any advice, please? No trollers please :(

126,"Sorry for the incoming rant but I have a few questions regarding the online-dating landscape in singapore. For some context, I'm a male NUS student and recently I've been trying out the online-dating apps since it is the holidays. As the matches come in, I observe that singaporean girls that use these apps don't seem to be interested in dating at all. They either lead you into a never ending session of small talk or they do not even intend on meeting anyone in real life. 

In terms of chatting online, most either give uninterested vibes/short replies (even when we are matched) or are somehow blind/unresponsive to my carefully crafted/decent open ended questions (not hard questions at all). When it comes to meeting up in real life, they simply refuse to do so (when the point of dating apps is to arrange a date to not only learn about the other person in real life but to see if there is chemistry).  

While I agree that my view is bias, especially after wasting days of small talk, I feel that I am not understanding something about singaporean girls. Do singaporean girls go on dating-apps to boost their ego or are they simply just a tough nut to crack? What are the usual norms in online dating? In the mean time, the only nut I can crack is my own.

TLDR: How to use online-dating apps?

He made personal attacks, guilt trip me, spoke ill of my family and friends, always put the blame on me, and he made me doubt myself. All these are just some of the things that he did to me. After the breakup, he spammed me with calls and texts that were filled with insults. It took me months to heal myself and get rid of his toxicity. While I have moved on and became stronger, he still texts and calls me once in awhile, which I ignored. Whenever I tell my family about his texts, they will say ""wah he can't move on ah.

131,"Just want to seek out some relationship advice here because I am afraid of messing up. Here goes.

I am currently a full-time student due to graduate within a year. I met my current (China) girlfriend 7 months ago and we have our ups and downs. We do enjoy each other's company and she seems to love me a lot.While I am her first boyfriend, she is not my first. She confessed to me after a few dates and we have been together since. The thing is, as much as I feel the need to care for her and look after her wellbeing, I do not feel a strong feeling of love to her nor anyone else, including my parents. I also do not feel strong emotions such as sadness. Is there such thing as being devoid of emotion ? I have been hurt deeply by a past relationship before, wondering if that could be the catalyst for the void? I tend to be very straightforward and tend not to be mindful of her feelings at times. However, I do apologise to her when I am in the wrong and attempt to make up for it by coaxing her with food. We also have different values but we try not to force them on each other. I see a future with her but I am afraid that the lack of 'love' for her may ruin everything.

1. I do want to be with her and spend my life with her but will such issues cause future problems between us, breaking the relationship?

We have quarrelled before such as why do I not do romantic things for her, post our pictures on social media (I have introduced her to my circle of friends and family), and a few other things along the lines of romanticism. Our sex life isn't that great because we do not engage in foreplay as she dislikes it. However, she frequently tries to initiate sex. 

2. Will this mismatch between us (love / sex life) cause problems in the future even though we are enjoying each other's company now?

She graduated recently and have started looking for a job. She intends to stay here with me but if she is unable to find a job here, she will return home. However, she does not believe in LDR and would rather that we break up if that becomes reality. I have assured her that even if we are in a LDR, we can make it work (video calls, travelling etc). The outlook doesn't seem optimistic to us, but I do not want the relationship to break apart because of uncontrollable factors.

3. Should I give up my 'freedom' to be with her in China or is there another way out?

132,"Hi fellow virtual friends, would appreciate for some advice on my current situation. Used to be a formal student in NUS :D

I have a close colleague turned friend whom I have been talking to rather frequently since early this year. We have been out on a few occasions for dinner/meet up as well and also been overseas together for short trips. 

Initially, I did not have any feelings for; but overtime, I have started to realise that I might have developed some feelings (although I’m not entirely certain)- as I do find myself upset when he doesn’t text me for the day and missing him being around me. I myself would not really initiate any conversation as it’s just not me. We are no longer colleagues now but still keep in close contact. 

He has otherwise yet to show any signs that he would like to progress this friendship further. On the other hand, we don’t really talk about relationship issues. However on one occasion, I had briefly mentioned that I did not feel ready for one. 

Do you think it is right if I talked to him about this issue? I’m afraid that it might ruin our friendship and that I might just be the one overthinking? Is it normal for a guy to be so close to a girl? I feel like it is causing me to fall deeper by being so close to me. I’m afraid and confused. I have not told anyone of my friends or family regarding this yet...

134,"To #73876,

Sucks to be you then. Your crush not doing anything bad must have made it harder for you to move on. 

Similarly, I confessed to my ex-close friend about 2 months after she's got cheated on. Less than a month after her break up, we got into a few arguments (as friends). Mainly due to me advising against her going onto dating apps so soon. On hindsight, someone this emotionally unstable and unappreciative of friendship really didn't deserve any help (she'd blocked me for a week just because I advised her to read some r/s books instead of going onto dating app). 

But the main story of this confession was that she didn't just reject me. She discussed her decision, at length, with another friend in our clique. That friend, whom I don't converse more than 3 days worth of words in a year, took this whole event as a laughing stock. Worse still, 
on that day after she'd rejected me, she proceeded in and said something along the line that I should get my closure by asking about why I was rejected. So, we basically went by a few hours of walking with me explaining which qualities of hers that I had fallen for. 

Anyway, OP of 73876, just be thankful. This is how emotion abuse is like. Some people can really exploit you thoroughly, squeezing every patience and Goodwill out of you for her own 感觉自我良好. For ending, I removed her from every aspect of my life, physically/digitally/etc. Ain't no time for this kind of toxic in my life.

I saw the messages between my gf of 3 years and another guy, 
pop up on her laptop.
All the juicy detail,
all the 'massages' 
that they give each other. 
The love confessions 
front and back at each other,
Like lovebirds, who have found each other.
All that, over the weekends. 
No wonder, why she never came home. 
After our last arguments, and off she went.
All my messages,
became double blue ticks.

Today,

My heart is shattered,
to a thousand pieces.
My chest tightened, pushing out all the air in my lungs.
My clenched fists, looking for something to smash.
My persistent coughing, which had lasted for a few days
suddenly healed. As if there is another pain
Excruciating pain. That nothing can match.

I want to scream, but out came nothing.
I want to cry, but no tears flowing.
All that lies within,
is now, 
emptyness.

Today,

I have realised. 
Love is blind,

And nothing lasts forever.
3 years went by,
blood, joy, sweat, tears.
""Let's travel around the world together""
she said.

But I think, With whatever sanity I have left,
to reckon.
There is a silver lining in every sad story.
She may have found true love.
While I, starting every thing
all over again.

So basically last Saturday I went to confront one of the “guy friends” of hers which I assume he likes her. 
I’m unsure how to explain this but when u saw a guy you can just tell that he actually likes your girl as a friend or with motives just by the way he looks at her. You just can tell. (Victim herself probably couldn’t and keep coming up with lies and well idk or she just love the attention of guys.)

Anyway I confronted him despite my girlfriend previously keeps claiming they just “friends” and he have no motives. Guess what? I was right he told me in the face that he likes my girlfriend and his willing to break his current gf to be with her. YEAH break his “current gf” to be with “my gf.” I almost punch the guy in the face seriously cannot take this anymore.. but fine at least I have an answer now that I was right all the way.

Anw Sunday I manage to get my gf out for HTHT again but face to face this time round instead of calls or messages. And I told her all this so basically she was shocked as she doesn’t believe me because she think boy girl friendship exist. (Totally fine they do, just rarely or I think so)

Anyway after telling her all this she somehow still doubt me and think that I'm making it up.
So yeah I did what guys should do instead of continuing be in this pain I broke up with her. (Really wish I recorded the freaking convo to confront her making her speechless)

Well at least now i no longer have to suffer this pain of neglecting, under prioritised  and heartache.

So this guy I met from dating app just held my hands while we were walking, and he didn’t say anything about asking me to me his Girlfriend. 

We had met up for dates for two months and there were good vibes between us. He mentioned previously he would like to bring the relationship as far as he could. 

My question is are we together now that he held my hands? I’m not sure how to ask him about our status and his commitment. From our last conversations, I inferred that he was looking for a serious relationship (so I don’t think think it’s a fling) and our values (like family and honesty) seemed to align. Yet, I would like to be sure by hearing it from him. I would like to ask him but I don’t want to give the impression that I’m pushing for a status. 

What does it mean when’s a guy holds your hands? He is pretty introverted and can be a man of few words, and never had a relationship before.

I've seen too many relationships fail and i really dont understand why 

What you advice you can give to someone looking for a relationship?

And 

What exactly ruins a healthy long term relationship? 

If i were to answer my question;
Expectations of your partner is the only problem. And the best partner one that has nothing to offer but love. Someone who isn't the most goodlooking, someone who doesn't have money to give, someone who doesn't have time to spare. If they have nothing to give but love, you won't spend your relationship expecting things from your partner and getting upset. I'd say it is possible to love without giving anything. 

What do you think?

It has taken me a long time to accept my feelings but I must admit I have fallen for another man. He is an exchange student from the united states.

I found a lot of traits in him that I seem to find lacking in my boyfriend, he is very independent, motivated, and passionate about his dreams. He told me he wishes to join the Marine to serve his country, and I feel it was really mature and patriotic of him. He is also very sensitive and romantic, he offers me his jacket when he thinks i am cold. Small actions like these really touches me.
With my boyfriend, he tends to complain about his reservist duties and I always try my best to cheer him up. He doesnt have much ambition other than getting a job and applying for a BTO. I know it is hard for singapore guys to have reservist, but I am tired of dealing with his complaints.
I did not cheat on my boyfriend because i do not wish to hurt him. But John, not his real name, has told me to end my relationship with my boyfriend and to be with him.
I am certain of my feelings for John, but at the same time, my boyfriend still really loves me and I don't wish to hurt him. Can any girls who have been through such a situation before give me any advice?

152,"So as a female I found out recently that my boyfriend aka fiance is actually gay and is interested in men. He came clean and told me that he wants to get married to me just to please his family members and hide this side of his life, but has also said that he appreciates me very much as a life partner. We have been together for almost 4 years and not once did I get a feeling that he was essentially interested in his own gender (not a single hint of it). How do I come to terms with this? I feel like the past 4 years has just been a facade. We have many good memories and even graduated together. Should I break this off or go ahead with this marriage knowing very well that there will never be genuine chemistry on his part? Confused and depressed at the same time ..

153,"I would like to find some good and genuine relationship advice.

I have been dating this girl through university and after (3 years). We spent a lot of good times together, shared similar life goals and drive, and have so much memories together. We also got to meet and know each others' family - loving and caring for them together. Life is such a bliss and I thought she was the one. 

However, everything fell apart five months ago. She started her work and went into society, and we had different schedules, priorities etc. There were also things she didn't like about me, and that I am partly at fault too. Anyway, Love was not strong enough to hold everything together. When 'reality' kicks in, finances, more and better options out there - she was still young and quite a catch, so things ended with us.

I still have feelings for her, and such memories are difficult to let go. I saw her as part of my family. But at the same time, I cannot control what she does or choosing to 'upgrade' to someone else. The pain is excruciating as I've given my all and she was a close one. 

Could Prof Ben and other commentators shed some light on this/ if I even should/ how I could win her back? 

Much appreciated.

Decent looks, above average fashion style, pleasant personality, stable job, social butterfly, good grades, (not that it matters intrinsically, but just trying to say that I walked a path many Asian parents would be proud of)

Saw a guy (stranger) that caught my fancy. Gave him my number. He contacted me. We started talking. We met up. Sounds like a fairy tale. Except that there’s no happy ending.. after the first meet up, we spoke for a few more days before I initiated another meetup. Then he just ghosted me :( should I give it another go? It’s been a month. Everything seem to be going well until I asked him to meet for the 2nd time. 

I have seen many posts here encouraging girls to “go for it”, “it’s 2020 soon”, “girls can confess too”. I have done everything and anything that I could. I joined clubs, participated in activities, used ALL the dating apps out there and even went on blind dates. Heck I even gave my number and still hit a wall. Yet I m still alone. Makes me wonder if I m just incapable of loving and being loved.

158,"How can I convince my bf that the past doesn't matter to me? He admitted that he cheated in his first relationship and that he subsequently had a series of flings/one-night stands. 

While perhaps that cheating wasn't the best decision he made, I could understand why he did so as his ex was basically very controlling and emotionally manipulative person who refused to breakup with him (he showed me her messages) and I somewhat know her. And for the flings...I don't have an issue with that.

While our relationship has been great, I feel that he continues to struggle with his past. I really don't mind it but I haven't been able to convince him that I fully accept his past and only want to look at the future. And even if we want to go into the specifics and say something that 'once a cheater always a cheater', its not fair if they want to change isn't it.

159,"I am a final year male NTU undergraduate going on internship in semester 2. Thought I should start my search for my significant other. Never dated or had a relationship before. I feel I am mature enough now after observing my parents and elders.

I met a NUS girl during summer 2019. I was attracted to her outgoing personality, and thought that she was straightforward, down-to-earth and mature. I felt that she appreciated that there is a diversity of people i.e. every individual is made differently, and each of them is perfect and imperfect in many ways. (To some people, this is known as empathy, or putting oneself in other's shoes. But this is just the way I view it.)

I asked her out but she said she didn't have time, but will keep me updated on her availability.

I texted her 3-4 times after that about casual topics, NOT about meeting up, NOT chasing for her availability. However, I did not receive a single comment from her. I gave her the benefit of doubt: busy school schedule and CCAs.

I consider myself to be an exceptionally patient person. This, I learnt from observing my parents. Is there anyone who dislikes a patient (boy/girl)friend?

After pondering one semester, and consulting my friend about the situation, I now know (or believe that it is most probable...like 99.99999%), she is uninterested and thus, ignoring me to reject me.

I am (very) disappointed with her, NOT because she rejected me, but because she chose ignorance. I thought she was more mature than what her inaction suggested.

Yes, I can imagine putting myself in her shoes. How would I feel and react if someone asked me out, but I am not interested? How do I politely reject this person? What if I misunderstood a friendly gesture as a romantic advancement?

Before meeting this ignorant girl, I had a crush on another girl. I was impressed at how she managed to explicitly say she was attached, but in a tactful and polite(?) way. Wow...so that's why she is already attached: her maturity. 

I am not asking to be rejected in a polite way (although I will appreciate it and wish you all the best nonetheless). All I ask is for some respect. I feel disrespected when you ignore me. It is worse than saying ""I am not interested in you."" Just say ""no"" and I won't bother you. I am not some immature pestering bugger who begs for attention. Not all guys are like that. For **** ' * sake.

As 2019 draws to a close, I reflect upon the lessons learnt in my journey to find my significant other.

Life is too short to play stupid games.

I want to be straightforward. I find speaking face-to-face better than texting due to the subtle body languages. After all, you are going to live with your significant other and see each other in person daily. There is no need to hide behind screens. No time for second guessing. However that doesn't mean I rush into things. I will try it out. If it doesn't work out, well so be it, let's wish each other the best. If it works out, well...

I'm just a boy, standing in front of a girl, asking her to love him.

""Looking back as lovers go walking past
All of my life
Wondering how they met and what makes it last
If I found the place
Would I recognize the face""

161,"For this story,i ll be using the name Jane Doe to conceal the girl identity in the story.

I met jane doe in cs1010s during y1s1 for one of the supplementary classes as we were struggle for one of the assignment and needed help. Jane and i exchange no so that we can discuss on future assignments for this mod as it was hard... we grow close together partly cause we suffered through this mod together.  she was lovable and cute.. kept calling me her senpai and it feels good for someone smart and pretty as her to call me that. and i did help her alot for cs1010s in sem1 and ger in sem2... and gotten quite close to her.  she is also supportive and encouraging of me to keep doing my best in my studies.

Fast forward y2s1 where the problems begin. We had our fair share of bad group mates in the mods we took. So i decided to group with jane doe and 2 of my good friends for this mod called ges1021. The first few weeks. She seemed like a nice and sweet girl.. and she and my friends got along fine. BUT she began showing signs that she might like me. Like playfully poking me and leaning on my shoulder from time to time and i was atttacted to her because she a pretty girl with a  sweet and kind deposition. Since we were expected to make our own notes for ges1021, she started to rely on my notes and that where things went sour.

Six strikes too many.  Firstly, Jane Doe began acting strangely during SEP application week. Jane Doe disappeared on our group when we need to decide places to go . But you re werent there and ignored me texting you 5-6 times whether she like to go a place near her house for convenience. But Jane Doe told us that she were busy with cca and sep and couldnt even bother to come to a non webcast lecture. Secondly, Jane Doe didnt bother to study for the mod you choose and complain how my notes are unclear for you to understand and decide to text me 100 qn to prepare for your midterms. I helped cause im afraid you were lagging too behind. Thirdly, you demanded me to restructure the notes i send her and even ask me to highlight in red the comments the prof stress on... but i was too blind to see and i thought is normal to help a girl you adore so much.

Fourthly, when the ges1021 prof said we had to change the location used for our project Jane Doe was furious. I get that. But the moment Jane Doe acted like she knew better than the prof  that where i draw the line. Cause no matter how smart you are is pretty arrogant thinking you re better than her right? Fifthly, closer to the deadline i get that you re stress with your competition coming and your geh midterms incoming. But you didnt have to show poor attitude by being all sarcastic about losing a few marks for not using apa format when you just want me to do the work or how you used me to do the work needed to be done when you could have asked the group. We re in this together but Jane Doe seemed to look out for herself and pretend to contribute significantly. when the rest of the group done significantly more work than whay you did. And lastly, you told me to make use of my ue as mod that can help me in the future. When i planed my sep outline with her advice in mind hoping Jane Doe would be happy for me. But she just ignored me.. like im only worth a damn when you needed my notes which you are expected to craft yourself and that the final straw cause at that point im just exhausted and just gave up on her. 

Am i crazy?
The whole sem i try and try to chase her and extend my hand to jane doe. But it seem she only interested and exploting me cause im just too gullible. I thought is normal for a guy to chase after a girl. And i must be crazy for not thinking she cant be in the wrong and that she still a good person. But she had me wrapped round her finger for her use. But thanks to my friends who at least let me see reason i decided to block her on whatsapp cause the girl i know no longer there and there no point keeping in contact with somebody who only want my notes..

So to Jane Doe, you really played me like a fiddle. And the kind-hearted girl i know before me is dead in my eyes. You probably wont change.. but at the very least from the experience i learn that you should have the strength and courage to walk out from any toxic relationship with anyone who just out there to exploit.. it is hard but a necessary evil.. that you have to take for your own good.

Almost all of my friends are guys and sometimes I wondered is it because of my guy friends that potential suiters backed away. Most of the time its other people (not my friends) who asked if xxx or yyy is my boyfriend, though they are not. It makes me feel like cutting them out of my life.

Nobody have ever confessed to me, and my guy friends either say they never wanted to get married, see me as a bro or that they don't wish to lose our friendship because I'm the nicest female friend they had, plus I always give really good advice.

Sometimes I wish that maybe someone, among my guy friends had actually liked me a bit since they can be really nice to me like (all 1 to 1) volunteer to drive me to and fro from home to a destination because I had too much things to carry, invite me to his house and cooked a really nice dinner, walk me home when it is very late, treat me a small meal here and there.

No skin-ship was involved in any of the activities and they didn't even stand close to me so no flirting was involved also. Without me saying anything they will sometimes reject me directly like calling me bro or reiterate our strong friendship. It makes me feel kind of sad sometimes.

Maybe I'm just chasing something that doesn't exists. And I should appreciate the friendships that I have. Sigh.

163,"Hi all, just need to rant and maybe seek some advice here. I've been in a 3 years relationship with my girlfriend. I'm 22 and she's 21. She is the sweetest, most attractive and most genuine woman I've known, but this statement is only applicable when she is in a good mood. Recently, we've been in a series of arguement and she is currently giving me the cold shoulders, on and off. For instance, last week, she desperately wanted to have her milo dinosaur, but since she was down with the flu, I stopped her and gave her warm water instead. She got pissed and stopped eating and simply watched me eat instead. The next day, she was back to her normal self again.

However, few days later, we argued again about cleaning her room. We have been living together for 2 months, with a maid, in another apartment, owned by her parents. Usually the maid will do the chores but she is on leave for 3 weeks due to some family issues at her hometown, so naturally, we had to do the chores. I started to tidy her room, including the wardrobe, toilet and her makeup table for her as it is in a mess, and vacuum it right after, but she got irritated, and questioned the purpose of arranging stuff when it's gonna be messy later on. Okay, I admit, I'm a clean freak so I cannot stand how messy things are. So, she got angry, and I've got chased out of her room since then. She doesn't even want to talk to me now and have been out with her girlfriends everyday to avoid me.

Yesterday night, after she got back home, I tried talking to her since I feel that things need to be fixed in this relationship. Although she was playing games on her phone and acted like she wasn't listening, I know she was. But she simply didn't want to contribute anything to the 'discussion'. I'm at wits end. I still love her, I'm willing to do the chores for her too but I feel like this relationship is reaching it's end after this fight. Love experts, help me, how can I make her things better. Please don't advice me to break up, because it won't be an option, unless she sincerely wants to.

I am a Chinese, but my boyfriend is a Malay. I want to be with him forever, but i dont want to convert to Muslim. It's not that i dont love him. I do love him, but im not a religious person. I dont think it is right to convert to a religion that i dont believe in.

I always asked him if we can just remain in our current religion when we get married, but he cant give me an answer.

With him, i can eat halal food (though i like non halal food more hahaha) or even accompany him on whatever festive (like Ramadhan). I wish we can reach a compromise. I dont want to lose him just because of religion issue.

171,"Seeking for honest opinions. Sorry, it will be a very long story. No trolls please.
I'm average-looking and I’m currently going out with a guy that’s 7 years older than me and is a working adult. He is attractive, smart, modest, humorous, has a well-paying job, very popular and most important of all, he has a good personality. I have some mutual friends that that has told me that he always tries his best to keep a distance from girls that approaches him as well.

We really love each other and always make consistent effort to try our best to spend time with each other, with him working around with his hectic working life and with me managing my examinations, projects, etc. He treats me very well, understands me, and is always the first to notice if I’m in a sour mood after going through a bad day. Occasionally we do have our quarrels and fights due to our differences, but we managed to resolve it and stick together despite it all, accepting the other for who we are. In overall, we are together with each other for a good 1.5 years.

I know all of this sounds too good to be true, and all this while I'm trying my best to improve myself to be better - be it in terms of working on my appearance, personality, learning new skills, etc. so that I would be able to better match up with him.

But here's the catch – at the beginning of the relationship, my family knows about it and objects to him, saying that he's too good for me and that he's not taking me seriously, as well as saying about some other really nasty stuff about him without knowing him all that well, which was not really fair to him. Of course, knowing that it definitely wasn't true, I tried to speak up for him, but they said that I was very blinded by him and that I should really face reality and wake up, why would someone of such a good calibre want me. 

I discussed about this with him and it landed a really huge blow to him, as he's really very concerned about the opinions of the people around me and he was depressed for quite a long period of time. He was really understanding and understands that my family just wanted the best for me and that it was normal for parents to be protective of their child, but was still very hurt from their comments nonetheless. He told me that it’s okay and I should not worry my family, let them think that we have broken off, and keep our relationship from my family for the time being and we will figure out a way to solve this somehow eventually. I tried to talk to him, cheer him up, but to no avail. We continued sticking together and after a few months, he went back to his normal cheerful self. My family still suspects me going out with him from time to time and was quite unhappy, but kept silent about it, only occasionally dropping hints here and there and prompted me about it.

He was very depressed to the point where his family noticed the changes in him, and was really concerned about him. After asking him about it and knowing about my family’s objections and hurtful remarks, his family, who had really liked me at the start, started hating on me with the same intensity of how much they had liked me previously. They were really angered by my family’s unjustified comments about their son. I only knew about later on where he kept me knowing about this all this while and only briefly told me that his family knows about this matter a year later. However, he did not tell me that his family hated me because he was afraid that I would be hurt. It was only then afterwards where I found out from my mutual friends about they hated me.

His family knows that we are still together and although they disagree to it, they still respected my S/O’s opinion and did not say anything much about us. However, recently, his family has started rushing him for marriage and asked when would he be able to bring a good partner home, to which, he replied to them jokingly to give him a year and he would find one girl to bring home (cause he’s in his late 20s, they are worried, and I think, they really object to us being together, hence asking those). He did not tell me about this because he was scared that I would overthink, it was from the mutual friend where I found out about this.  

Honestly, I don't know what to do anymore. I’m having thoughts where I think I’m keeping him from finding his right one, but still, I really don’t want to leave him. I’m not telling him about this because I do not want him to worry about me. I’m very confused. What are your opinions on this?

172,"Just wondering, do you think it’s a valid reason to not think of your partner when you get off just because you see them as “way more than just that”? Does being in a relationship mean you can and should only think about one person even in your sexual thoughts/alone time? Or do you think it’s ok to separate the emotional and the sexual? How would you feel if your partner tells you that they love you but is somehow not aroused by you? Or if you’re the said partner, would you feel guilty - as though you’re taking advantage of your partner even though you’re not sexually attracted by then?

While i'm freaking poor, have many loans, and can't even afford hawker food and live in a 4 people per room hdb. It's so hard to keep up dating with him as we often have expensive dates, even he paid it all i felt very embarrassed sometimes and tried to pay. And when he bought me expensive gifts like branded bags i felt worse because i can never afford something like that for him. He often told me a lot of his trips around the world, eating at fancy restaurants weekly and everything and i could not understand or relate any of it. His exes are all super rich too. I feel like a cinderella dating him and the gap is getting bigger each day. And he often scolded me as ""I don't know how to behave nobly or classily"" and it hurts me a lot. Idk what to do about this and how to reduce our social gap :(

He will be playing games/scrolling Facebook/watching videos, doesn't initiate chat anymore. And when I initiate, he will say he watching video or doing some other stuff. Just doesn't seem interested anymore. Kept thinking about our first year where things were so different, just felt kinda sad? He still tell me he love me but somehow that wasn't enough anymore coz I can't feel it? Haven't married like that, married already how? We have been talking about getting a bto but this honestly scares me a little

And I know some people will say communication is key I should talk to him about it but certain stuff such as the daily small talks with each other, you would want your bf/gf to want to do it right? Rather than talk about it and only then he does it

1) Has anyone been a victim of parental objection and did you resolve it? How do you stage the opportunities for your significant other to gain brownie points. Did they eventually accepted him? Or
2) Are there a people who have been cut away from their parents because you eventually chose to marry your SO. But were there eventual improvement to your relationship with them?

3) Off topic a bit, we communicate about it before knowing money can get sensitive, but how do people manage money contribution in a marraige when one earns more than the other. Especially in a patriarchal leaning society where people expect guys to be the breadwinner.

If anything, it gives you better chances of meeting matches and showing your strong qualities that may way outshine your height. I got to know my current boyfriend on Tinder and he's only slightly taller than me, but that has never been an issue. He never put his height on his profile, neither did that matter when we met. I'm quite short for a girl, by the way! And my exes were pretty tall yet I never felt the same level of attraction for them. So yes you can be short and really attractive, and no it's not necessary to state your height on your profile. Just go on a date and see how things go.

201,"I SWEAR I'M NOT A TROLL, THIS IS A SERIOUS QUESTION. 

My boyfriend and I will be going on exchange and while we'll be in the same country, we'll still be around 5 hours away from each other. We're considering embarking on an Open Relationship and allowing each other to explore and experiment with other people while overseas and I'm wondering if there's anything I should look out for that could potentially ruin our relationship. 

For more context, we're already in an Open Relationship here (we attend different unis). We actually do spend a lot of time together and like each other very much. We've got a strong relationship and vibe very well together, we just both like the idea of casual hook-ups a lot and didn't see why we needed to give it up just because we're officially attached (although we do intend to be exclusive at some point and have already begun to taper off the casual sex rather than just cutting it off completely so it becomes less sudden...) We don't have any problems with jealousy and are open with each other when it comes to discussing who we sleep with and how we feel.   

However, I'm also aware that having a long-distance open relationship has a vastly different dynamic from one where we see each other three times a week. And things could be potentially more dangerous overseas   (sorry if I'm being paranoid but sexual assault? college drinking gone wrong?? more STDs to pick up??). Have any other couples done this before? What happened in the end? Any problems to look out for? Any important questions to ask before we start on this?

I already in my late twenties but the only times I receive flowers was when my boss asked the admin to send me a large set of flowers to my grandpa’s funeral and when I performed on stage in secondary school. In my last serious relationship, I hinted to my bf that I wanted flowers but during one karaoke session a few weeks before we broke up, he even had the cheek to sing “When I was your man” into my face. (Think the first line of the chorus). 

I wanted flowers so much that sometimes I think, whoever is the first guy who gives me even one stalk of flower for romantic reasons, I will secretly decide to marry him if he wants to marry me in the future and if he’s not a jerk. I know it’s silly, but that’s how much it somehow irrationally meant to me. I confided about this to a friend and she asked why flowers, why not chocolate why not anything else. I think, it’s probably the meaning of the validation that comes with it - that flowers are pretty, that if someone is willing to spend the money to buy something expensive that last only a few days, you must be worth it in his eyes. I mean, after working, I have the financial ability to buy myself a whole room of flowers if that’s all I want. I also can ask directly for flowers in my next relationship, but it’s just not the same.

So she decided to break up with me, despite me fighting hard to keep the RS going.
I'm still slowly trying to come to terms with this, and just need a space to let it out I guess.

My heart hurts. I loved you with everything, and tried to make life happier for you. I always told myself that I had to make you smile no matter what, when you were having one of those depresso moments. And i did. It always made me smile too.

I know you find it hard to deal with the fact that life together in the future is highly unlikely due to your condition, and also the more pressing factor of our families being of different religious backgrounds/race.

But I still love you, and you still love me. It hurts me to see that you've given up when I'm still fighting. But then again, I'm happy when you're happy. And I can understand why it might be easier for you to give up. It pains me to know that i can't be the person to comfort you whenever you feel down. It hurts me to know that we can't ever share the happiest experiences together again.

I cry whenever I see our photos together, when you and me were laughing and smiling. Why does life have to be so hard on interfaith/racial relationships when it comes to family? The depression just stacks on.

I can't find it in myself to give up on you. I don't know how to give up on you. I know you're still undecided on whether or not we could get back together as a couple because we still love each other, but you feel it's easier for you to break it off for now.
You cry whenever you see me cry, so I try to hide the sadness.

I have been with my gf for abit over a year now. We recently broke up 2 months back over some petty argument, but it was a clean and mutual break, which I didn't feel really bad about as I felt that the r/s is already nearing its end. However, less than a week she came back begging me to stay and she said she regretted breaking up and that she just kept crying and she can't live without me, so I got back with her to give it another shot. 

Within these 2 months, I really tried my best to be a good boyfriend and to spend time with her, we even had plans to go overseas during this winter holiday break (she's not from NUS tho). But right now, in the midst of exams, I'm wondering if i really did the right thing by staying because I really don't feel that I love her anymore, and by staying I just feel that I'm cheating her of her feelings. And I really don't foresee a future with her in this country due to her family background and problems, mainly money wise.

What's even more fxxked up is that I've actually fallen for another girl, she really reminded me of my gf when I first met her, but she's cuter, smarter and definitely better-looking. She's has those attribute that I want to find in a gf/future wife. Tbh, I never thought that I would be in this position where I would fall for another girl while I am still in a r/s (this is my first r/s actually), and I’ve always thought “why would people cheat?”. But right now for me, I just don’t feel attracted to my gf anymore, and I would prefer to be single right now so that I can chase this new girl.

At his family events, we would always meet this cousin of his - a few years younger than him and extremely attractive (my type)/also guy I would have gone for as well. And I do catch his cousin looking at me here and there and when we are left alone to speak, he seems shy/finds it hard to maintain eye contact and I feel such tension between us.

However, he has been asking me when I'll be coming over/where and how soon, repeatedly. 

I shared this with my boyfriend to see if I'm reading into things, and he believed his cousin asks out of curiosity. He senses nothing and I dont say too much as well. But I just canttttt stooopp looking, imagining and thinking if his cousin is indeed interested in me and if/when I go over...

231,"To OP #72798:

I actually have a differing view from most of the rest. You already mentioned that both of you have different personalities - you are extrovert and he is an introvert. Usually an introvert recharges by being alone, whereas you get more energised being around people. One of the common misunderstandings would be to think that there is a problem when an introvert keeps quiet. That is just the way they are.

Try approaching it from a point of view where you share about how you genuinely feel - that you are sharing your issues with him because you see a relationship as working things out in life together. I think what you shared here is very good and that it is something you should be speaking to him about (that you are confused, and would like to spend more time; and that you feel that if it is not fulfilled, you are worried about the relationship, but because it is important to you that is why you are speaking to him about it).

It is easy to give up, but every relationship will have its problems. It takes strong perseverance to work it out.

232,"Disclaimer: I am not a homophobe, I think people should be allowed to love who they want.

Would I be an asshole if I break up with my SO because they’re bisexual? I love my SO very much, we are in a serious relationship - discussed BTO, travelled with the families and even decided to get engaged in Year 4... Breaking up feels extreme, especially since there is no immediate problem. My SO has always been open about being bi and has slept with many people of the same gender before we started dating so I don’t think I’m crazy for being a little worried that they’re fully homosexual and not bisexual. I really have no problem with their sexuality - I just don’t want to be 45 and divorced because my partner has left me the minute same-sex marriage becomes legalised.

Am I a terrible person for feeling this way? I’ll admit my understanding of sexuality is limited (for now, really working on that). I’d like to ask for reassurance - what can I do to feel less insecure and to get my partner to help me out? I want to have THAT conversation but I don’t know where to start...

233,"I’m so mad right now and I’m not even from NUS. 

My best friend is in NUS and is one of the sweetest person I ever known, who would rather secretly stare at her crush than talk to them. Recently, she started seeing a guy - he was taking her out for dates every week, making promises of where to take her after finals, texting her... You know the drill. She didn’t tell me about him (I only found out about him when I saw them them by chance on a date), but she was the happiest I seen her in a long time. Suddenly, after sending her home... He one up and disappeared. No text, no calls, no replies, nothing. 

I didn’t even know what was going on until I called her and realised she was crying. After asking, she finally told me he disappeared, and was wondering what she did wrong (spoiler: probably nothing at all). While I was beyond mad and cursing him, guess what? She was still defending him, saying he might be busy, saying it was reading week, and being worried that something might have happened. We opened Instagram together and low and behold, he was alive and well, posting about studying in school with his friends.

I’ve known her for many years and this was the first time I’ve seen her so sad... And it’s all YOUR fault. I mean if you’re truly busy you could always send her a text telling her you gonna MIA. If you wanted to stop seeing her and end dating, just tell her it’s not working out. Ghosting her without an explanation is cowardly after all the time you spent together! This is why NUS science guys have a bad rep and keep ending up in scandals, after all, the lot of you seem to be the same kind.

234,"Who should I choose?
1. A local guy who really likes me, cares about how I feel, always initiates dates, misses me when I leave the country for a bit and is just an overall wonderful person. Although I don't feel physically attracted to him.

OR

2. A girl halfway across the world, who I have been dating for 1 year +. I love her so much even though we don't spend much time together physically cause of the distance but we speak on the phone every single night (midnight to 2am cause of the time difference). We have a lot in common and conversation is easy. But she has periods of time when she falls into these depressive episodes and pushes me away and makes me feel even more distant from her. But we make up within a day and she tells me she loves me very much too. Also, I'm 100% sure my family will not approve of me being gay.

I'm really at a loss on what to do. Should I continue my relationship with my girlfriend or end it with her and start a new relationship with the guy? Please help.

235,"I have a Japanese girlfriend and we have been together for about a year now. Most of my relatives have seen her before during CNY and family gatherings. I also sometimes bring her to meet my friends when I go out with my friends. Most of them tell me that she is very pretty, have big eyes, is mature and some seem envious too. One female friend was even surprised that my girlfriend is both pretty and have big boobs (which is rare in sg). 

However at the back of my head I was thinking that ya she is pretty and has a nice body but a lot of girls in Japan and Korea are like that too. In singapore she would be considered to be very pretty (because we don’t focus much on appearance I Guess). Why is it that many guys like to stick to singaporean girls when there’s better and prettier girls out there (and without princess syndrome)?

Just let me rant here. 

Sometimes i feel kind of tired of this relationship. My bf doesn't ask me anything, about my day, about my plans (whether I'm going out or anything), or what i am doing etc. Sometimes the whole day we would only converse not more than 5 lines, that wouldn't even be able to say it's 5 sentence. If i don't start a topic, he won't either. On those rare times when he text me first, i would be so happy. 

I spoke to him about it. He just say there's nothing special going on in his life. And next question i would think is 'then aren't you interested about my life? Or what am i thinking? Don't you want to know more about me, just like i would want to know everything about you.' Else, he would say that he isn't someone who is good at texting. Else, he would say that he is tired from work (which i can empathize to an extend). 

BUT when we meet in person, we are the other way round. He would be the one chatting more, while I'm usually the listener. He would fill me up on what he have been doing since we last met - sometimes in details, sometimes briefly. In person he is a bf that always make sure to send me home and is good to me and i alwayd enjoy being out with him. 

I thought to meet him more frequently, assuming that he is really not a good texter. But lifeshits makes us difficult to do so frequently.  The max was always twice in a week and it's difficult to do so every week. So it's kind of hard to test out this theory. 

Sorry for ranting so much. But in summary, girl is usually the one initiating convo in texts. Guy rarely starts convo. Guy reply girl but sometimes it's also a short reply which makes girl difficult to continue the convo. Girl can't do HTHT with guy frequently because guy thinks it's the girl thinking too much/being too emo and guy is uncomfortable expressing emotional stuff. 

Advice pls?

237,"*WARNING LONG POST AHEAD* 

This story involves 2 other people. For simplicity, I shall name them:

A - my childhood best friend
B - the love of my life 

I have known A almost my whole life, growing up in the same neighbourhood, going to the same primary, secondary & poly together. We would usually meet up most of the days since we only stayed 5 minutes apart. Be it for movies, meals, playing Basketball, hanging out at the park to talk about life etc. We were basically like siblings. He was blessed with good looks and I would always feel inferior to him. He could easily talk to girls as he was an extrovert, while I was completely the opposite. 

I met B when I was in secondary school, we met by an unusual situation whereby her best friend and my table partner had feelings for each other, so we would try to arrange for ways for them to meet after school. B was the first girl I ever talked to. We would then go on to be “text buddies” throughout our secondary life. I began to develop feelings for her along the way but never managed to express it due to the fear of rejection. She was the one girl I would talk to day & night, sharing our daily experiences with each other. Occasionally going out for movies and meals. We probably could have ended up together if I had a little bit of courage to ask her. (Bear in mind that I am the extreme case of an introvert, so it’s really difficult for me to express my feelings to others.) But I was contented with just being her friend at that point of time.

Time flew and we were eventually in poly, I was still in touch with B but our conversations would shorten due to being out of things to talk about. This is when things would start to get a little complicated. During my poly days, my friendship with A started to deteriorate as he decided to join the MLM craze happening at that time. He would occasionally ask me to join as he claimed that his company had good plans for high returns. My parents always told me to stay away from people like that and I would do so. But 1 day, I decided to just trust the friendship we forged over the years and had a go and invested in 1 of the plans he said was “fool proof”, hoping to get easy cash but just waiting out a couple of months. The time came when he promised me the returns would be delivered but of course, it never did. I decided to let it go by since he also invested in that scam scheme and continued my friendship with him, since he was also in the same boat. But of course, my friendship with him was not as solid as before, as I would decline to meet him as frequently as before. 

Soon after, A contacted B through social media and they started to chat. I was curious as to why A would suddenly want to talk to B, but I didn’t ask him about it cause he told me B was never his type since Secondary days. I decided not to bat an eye cause I wasn’t afraid of A ever liking B, since A knew how much B meant to me. At most, we could all become closer together and hang out even more right? Well, I was stupid to hope it was that case.

Fast forwarding a couple of weeks, A called me one night at asked “Hey if by some reason, I happen to catch feeling for B, will you get angry?” At that exact point I already knew, that he had feelings for her, if not why so would he even ask me that question? I of course responded with “Of course I will, you always knew my feelings towards her right?” He replied with “Yes of course. Alright see you soon.” 

I then saw through social media that they would “flirt” with each other through every tweet or post and began to think that they might actually already be together. But both A & B was reluctant to make it public as they were afraid it would hurt me. 

Following a few days, B suddenly asked me if I wanted to meet up and “catch up on life”. At that point I was sure that they were together and she wanted to break the news to be about them being together. I pretended not to know and proceeded anyway, hoping for a small miracle it wasn’t true and would favour me in some way. 

The day came when all hells would break loose for me. I met her at our usual meeting place and “caught up on life”, laughing and talking about the past incidents and the mutual TV shows we would watch. Towards the end of the meeting, I could sense she was a bit awkward, thinking of ways to break the news of them being together. Hence I just went ahead and decided to tell her, “Hey look, I know you and A are together...” She looked me in the eye for a few seconds, stunned and then proceeds to say, “Yes we are, I hope you understand and accept that. Hope it doesn’t affect our friendships.” 

Hearing those words, which I already knew to begin with, had affected me more that I thought it would. I was boiling with rage inside and in that heat of the moment, I said some terrible stuff like, “You know you aren’t going to last long with him right? He is a player and always plays with feelings. You are never going to be happy with him, and you can tell him that the friendship is over and he can go to hell. All the best to you anyway.” I immediately walked out of the restaurant after saying those words, without hearing what she had to say or what her reaction was, cause I was afraid I was only going to make matters worse if I stayed on. 

Once I reached home, I decided to block them both from all my social media’s since I didn’t even want to see A’s face. 

It was been a good 5 years since that incident. Recently I have been having dreams about B, all happy dreams such as us going out together, talking to each other again. I couldn’t help myself but to want to find a way to talk to B again. I can’t accept losing B in my life cause of actions done by A. Till this day, I regret blocking B and losing her. 

Oh and please note that A and B are not together anymore as I have mutual friends who would update me about B time to time. They broke up in that year they got together. I really miss B a lot, and am desperate to find a way back in her life. But I’m not sure if she will forgive me for what I did/said to her in our last meeting. 

So please, I need some advice on what I should do. Should I just let things be as they are now? If not, what should I do to get B back in my life?

239,"Since young, I have always been socially-deemed as unattractive. People always bullied me because I was damn ugly and fat. Also, my love life was literally non-existent, all the girls that I liked never liked me back. Mind you, I was really trying my hardest to get a gf, but to no avail. Due to my image, I had zero self-esteem. I was very depressed and sad most of the time, and I just felt very empty and I just wanted to feel something. 

After army, I got into NUS Biz. I didn't get the chance to apply for FOPs so I had little to no friends in school. I tried signing up for Aphrodite lately but after getting both matches, they immediately ghosted me after seeing my profile picture, why do people always judge me by my looks first...

Last year, however, I met the girl of my dreams. I went for NUS Bizad Charity Run 2019 alone last year. I wanted to motivate myself to be healthier and also hope the I could meet some new people. During the run, I accidentally tripped and fell at the basketball court area. Even though it wasn't that serious, I was pretty shagged out from the run and laid there for a while. Suddenly, this really chio girl who was in the middle of running stopped and approached me, asking if I was okay. I was super shocked because I never thought someone like her would approach me.

She helped me up and kept asking if I was ok. I told her I was fine and that I could continue running and wanted to finish it. She then offered to run the rest of the route together and wahhh I was literally damn happy but tried to look calm. She was wearing a pair of light pink Nike shoes with the blue shirt. And not to be creepy or anything, but she smelt really good too. She was chatty and bubbly throughout the run, and we talked about life in NUS. She was also from Biz. Sadly, the run ended and she really made 5 km seem like 1 km. Even though we talked for a bit, my dumbass couldn't bring myself to ask for her name, and she didn't ask me for mine either. I have never been able to get her out of my head ever since, I really wish I can see her again. 

 I hope that I will be able to find her through NUSWhispers and that she will be reading this. To that girl: I really hope that that you have signed up again for the upcoming BCR 2020. If you haven't I hope you will do it in hopes of being able to run together again. I will definitely be on the lookout for those light pink nike shoes at the starting line at 5pm outside MRB :')

In other words, you stand a chance, go for it. For all you know, her relationship may have already been rocky and on the verge of a break-up. Instead of distancing yourself away, while not stay by her side to render support when required?

So I’m still in Uni (Year 2) and he’s already working (just graduated from NUS). We used to hang out twice or thrice or even four to five times a week when we were both schooling but now I don’t even see him for two, sometimes three weeks. When I do, it’s sometimes only for ten to fifteen minutes when I visit him at home. When he first started working, we used to make the effort to meet for lunch or dinner often but now he's so busy with work (major events coming up) and I have exams and projects and I'm stressed and he's stressed and the distance makes me feel sad. Like I see the couples who crash each other's lectures or just hanging out 24/7 on Instastory and while that was never us, we led our own fairly separate lives because different schools, and the age gap but it still kinda makes me miss him. And I'm always so worried that he will meet someone else outside at work meanwhile I doubt I'll leave him for anyone in school because he's already TOP-tier husband material. 

I don't even let him pay, we still go Dutch and give and take during dates because I don't want him to feel like I am a burden. We also fight because I get jealous of him being so close to his colleagues (even his male ones). We also don’t have as much in common anymore, his problems are all so “adultish"" - he's even started talking about marriage and BTO and while I am excited by that prospect, I can't help but feel a little intimidated (I'm only 20!)I love him so much, what can I do to keep our relationship strong?

246,"My boyfriend (23M) and I (21F) have been going out for sometime and things are great. I've been with multiple guys in my life (sexually) and therefore have multiple experiences, whereas for him he has never been with any one sexually (although he is so hot). Anyway, I'll keep this short. 

So we both know what we like in sex; I am very submissive while he is very dominant. Once, when drunk, things got hot and we had a very very good time except that we couldn't fk properly because we were both too drunk. Well we finally tried to do it again once sober when things got hot and steamy again. 

I was mostly on top of him making most of the moves and I noticed from the very beginning already that he seemed to have not much clue as to what to do/ how to continue. It was a bit weird for me because I am not used to making almost all the moves and being on. top most of the time. But knowing that he might be worried about it as he doesn't have much experience, I just tried to keep things going and  kind of guide him at times. Then he began to do more and you know getting and top and all that but right before we were going to fk, I noticed he slowed down and there were moments he would just look at me for a really long time or look into space. 


Well, I started asking him if things were fine, etc but he just said things like yeah don't worry it's fine. But clearly there was something wrong because he continuedhaving this worried look. I slowed down and got up, looked him in the eyes and told him to not worry and that he can tell me anything. Finally, he told me that he was really worried that sex would turn out shitty, that he wouldn't be able to please me, thathe felt like a baby beside me because he didn't know what to do. 

I just tried to comfort him, telling him that it didn’t matter to me, to focus on himself, and that we can get better with practice. That the optimal sex between 2 different people is always different. However, no matter what I say, I can’t get him to stop worrying... 

Please guys, is there anything I can do/say to help him feel better? If you were in his position, what would help? Should I try to guide him more (initiate more)? Thanks in advance everyone. Will update. 

Tldr; great relationship but boyfriend worried to have sex with me because I have experience but he doesn’t.

This semester, I met a guy friend, whom I was friend with two years ago, very randomly in another lecture but we hardly talked. 

One day, I came to the lecture early and I saw him sit alone. So, we just naturally caught up with stuff like what the plan would be after graduation (we are both year 4). Then, he randomly mentioned a book that I liked as well, and I mean, for the guy friends I know, they don't really read books like that. 

Since then, I enjoyed talking to him more and I realized he had a great smile. He made me laugh a lot, and we seemed to have the same interests. Sadly, the semester ended and we would possibly never see each other again. 

You know the feeling when you have a crush on someone and enjoy being with him but at the same time you are afraid he might just treat you as a friend, or when you are so curious to know about his love life but you never dare to ask?

Not that i have a problem with that but i found out that he discusses our sex life with one of his girl friends. Recently, i scrolled through his dms (we have access to each other’s acc since forever), and i found out that that girl friend of his sent him a post of a girl covered in hickies. He then replied “just saw, wtf insane sia”

Not sure if this is already a red light in the relationship? She sends him girls who show cleavage and ass as well(she shows a lot of cleavage).. when confronted, he denies and says that they’re only friends. The horny sending of posts continues till today. They also send each other explicit sex position stickers on telegram.. To make matters worse, 5 months ago, I decided to stop having sex with him because i wanted our relationship to be build on passion before anything sexual. He talks about her all the time like how he’s worried for her studies and how she spends a lot of time clubbing and going on dating apps. But when i do badly for a test, he doesn’t even express concern.

Is this because we are already too comfortable with each other? I trust him but i think sending explicit post on instagram to his girl friend is ridiculous. He also does not see the logic behind where I’m coming from. Not sure if it is because he needed to satisfy his sexual needs that I no longer provide?

Since we see each other pretty often (due to work), my feelings towards him have been growing stronger these days. We text each other almost every day, about random thoughts and events. Most of the time he does not reply to my messages immediately maybe because he is busy with work.

He's generally shy and sometimes I feel this awkwardness between us. I wondered if he likes me or at least has some feelings about me too. So I sent some signals such as really light flirt messages and giving him gifts. But he didn't reciprocate to any of those. Eventually, I asked him for a movie. I could see that he put in some effort into dressing up and getting hair done. And he did look cute that day. Anyway, we just watched a movie. Nothing happened. After the movie, we walked along and chatted a bit on the way to the bus stop. And we went home separately. I really enjoy talking with him despite occasional awkward silence between us. And he doesn't seem to dislike me. Sometimes I feel frustrated because he took like one day to reply to me. And I was telling myself okay I'll cool down a bit and try to put everything behind. Then soon after I see him again, the desire of getting closer to him and more connections with him is back again. This has been really torturing for me. Due to the nature of work, we still have to see each other like 3-5 times a week. I'd like to seek for some advice here.  I really like him. What should I do? I'm not sure if he likes me? After so many tries on my side and no response from him, maybe I should take it as a no? Or should I be honest with him? But tbh, I have not thought about the realistic future between us such as age difference, different education background, family, and maybe income etc.? All these do not matter to me that much when it comes to a person's characters and virtues. But maybe he is concerned about those? What should I do?

259,"Hi everyone, OP of #72358 here. I've read all of your comments on my original post and am really grateful for the support from this community. Long read ahead.

Just recently things got worse again. Short backstory is that we will be attending a semi formal gathering with many others with banquet dinner and some senior staff involved with performances as well. The dress code is not stated clearly but hearing from other friends who will be attending, many are not wearing formal suits and just wearing button up shirts and formal pants.

As someone who does not like to dress up so nicely as my mentality was that fashion was never a major concern for me growing up, I felt that wearing a collared button up shirt and formal pants was sufficient enough. However, my girlfriend felt otherwise.

She has known that i am really not the type to dress up, all be it that i do dress up nicely when during the appropriate times such as going to a nice restaurant for our anniversary or to a wedding dinner. My schedule had finally cleared up for me to have more free time in the past week and she began asking me what i would wear to the event. She initially suggested for me to wear a suit and a bowtie to match colours with her dress to be cute couple matching kind of thing. I told her as kindly possible that i preferred to wear my original outfit as money is tight for me now while looking for a part time job, but would be open to match colours if i could find the same shirt with the same colour as her dress.

I believe that i was firm with my decision the first time she asked me about it, but i was asked several more times in the past few days about taking on her offer about wearing a bowtie or get a blazer. After telling her that her pestering was getting slightly repetitive since i had told her the same response each time she asked, she took offense to my response and got upset at me quite badly. She ended up sending me a whole string of messages (about 10-15?) but shortly deleted them afterwards and ghosted me until the afternoon of the next day (this took place around night time).

This wasn't the first time this had happened. I couldn't catch all that she wrote as i was away from my phone but caught slight glimpses of what she wrote in some messages. Some of them included ""goodnight this is what we've become i guess"" and ""Sometimes i dont get why its so difficult for you to do (this and that)"". I could get the vibe that she said all of that in the moment, but she had told me previously that when she's drunk or angry her filter goes off and she really tells the truth. Its happened before but this time felt worse than all the others.

The whole commotion ended with me agreeing to her request and got a blazer that matched her dress colour, which further worsened my financial situation now which she knows isn’t doing that good and i could do with saving cash and not spending it on certain unnecessary items. I crumbled under her pressure and gave in.

Side tracking for a bit, a family friend of mine recently passed away by suicide and i told my gf about it and how my family has been affected especially my mum who has teared up at random times just thinking of what happened. I've told her to really stop with the suicide threats and saying about suicide so openly as i believe those who truly feel suicidal tend to not show signs of it, yet she has still continued with the recent meltdown leading up the deleted messages part.

Back to the main topic, I feel that our relationship has been over for a while, but neither of us has taken the step forward to end it properly. From my perspective, it feels as if she would be better off as a person without me. She had previously told me that she would not leave me because she believed that people usually find their soul mate, and she could not understand how people could date more than one person after breaking up with their previous partner/s.

I have suggested taking a break from each other for us to grow and mature, to learn from our mistakes and become better persons for each other. She shot the idea down and said that it was either we were with each other or not at all. I think it is time for me to take the first step for what needs to be done for the better of her and the both of us.

And if you are reading this L, I’m sorry for our lows but thankful for sharing the moments we had with each other, you’ve taught me how to love someone other than my family more than i could ever have. I love you, but it is time for us to be apart and mature for the better of each other and our future partners.

So basically i feel she's kinda like wife material but damn hot kind. After chatting for a few days i initiated texting exclusively and she agreed. In the next few days, we talked about what we do to our families to our career plans and ideal family life. Our convos were also punctuated with quite abit of sexual tension. We would often refer to each other as bb, baby or babe and often drop miss you or love you msgs. 

In a week's time i asked her out for our first date and she suggested that I pop by her place. Well I am completely open with fwb ish rs and is in fact extremely excited that she is the other party. A part of me was planning to start out as fwbs and get the girl eventually - cause hot wife material damn. We made plans to meet and we both expressed how much we cant wait to be in each other's arms. 

The following day, however, she just completely deleted our chat and when I tried checking up her handle again I think she blocked me. 

Can someone tell me whats going on here? I am honestly feeling abit hurt cause our convos were really good - like both meaningfully good and fwb ish good. But at the same time im familiar with how im supposed to feel with regards to fwb ish rs. What is she doing/feeling all these while also? And what does that last move mean?? Maybe she had some emergency/unforseen circumstance that led to this sudden cutoff?? Or was i too agressive/desperate in showing my keeness that i scared her off?? Did we progress too quickly??

270,"Hi, I am evergreen and never had a girlfriend before. Before coming to NUS, I was from a predominantly male school so I have very few contact with girls. I have no female friends as well. Now, I am trying to find a girlfriend but I find the prospect of talking to a girl and hanging out one to one with her very stressful. I tried tinder before and went on a few tinder dates but I personally found those to be very very stressful. Before the date, I have to dress well (I usually wear T-shirt and shorts when I go out with my male friends), do my hair, put on contacts and shave. As such, when I go out with such attire, I feel very self conscious and not like myself. I feel like the whole world is staring at me and judging me, thinking why the hell is he dressed like that for? On the date itself, I would feel very stressed up trying to keep the conversation going and making sure I do not say anything that might potentially offend her or make her think I am a lowly creep. I tried getting a girlfriend in NUS but whenever I am in a one to one situation with my fellow female coursemate, I would feel very stressed up trying to keep the conversation going and making sure I don’t come across as weird and creepy. At times I would just feel like breaking down mentally and running away. Thus, I avoid asking them out even on casual lunches. Just asking them for lunch is stressful and I fear what they might think my intentions might be, which is why I procrastinate a lot before I actually do ask them out. I never had this problem with guys as I feel that they are less judgmental and more accepting of me. Compared to girls, I feel at ease around them and am able to say and do what I want freely without fear of social repercussions. Thus, til now, I never had a female friend, much less a girlfriend. But sometimes when I see pretty girls around campus, I really wish I had a girlfriend, although the prospect of dating seems very daunting. Even my coursework feels 1000x easier compared to this. What should I do?

1. Will your boyfriend dance for you for one hour just because you made him breakfast? Will he strum the guitar  while gazing into ur eyes, while singing a love lullaby, just because you helped clean the windows? 

2. Will your boyfriend say “love you” or “saranghaeyo” (the Korean version) daily? 

3. Mosst importantly, your boyfriend may ignore you. He may push you away. He may break up with you, block you on social media, block your calls, and even say to your face “I’m sick and tired of you. We’re broken up, please don’t harass me any more” while maintaining an icy cold glare. 

4. Will a male idol even bother picking fights? Will an idol quarrel with you? Will an idol block you on social media? Will he push you away, accusing you of being “too clingy and irritating” when you fly with him from  airport to airport, from concert to concert? 

5. No, an idol will never reject u or push you away from him. Unlike boyfriends who may get tired if you, an idol will only look at you with sweet puppy eyes and say “I love you”, and croon the sweetest sounding love ballads into your ears (if you have his song in ur phone, u can feel love any time u want!) 

6. And what did I do for my idol in exchange for all the affection? Why, I helped him clean his windows? I helped him wash dishes? No, all I did was to become his fan. 

7. Yeah, all these is fake. Then dating a real boyfriend is real? You sure? Look at the “real” boyfriends pretending to say “I love you forever and ever!” They don’t mean what they say obviously, see how many cheat! See how many abuse their wives and beat them! See how many subject their girlfriends to gaslighting, manipulation, and physical violence! 

8. On the other hand, chasing an idol never subjects you to gaslighting, physical violence, and cheating. Idols are always there for you, whether or not you bother to help them cook, clean and tidy the house.

People seem to have no problem when their friends stay in contact with ex classmates and ex hall mates, but they seem to get jealous instantly when their boyfriend/girlfriend stay in contact with ex lovers? 

So it means if I have a new professor in NUS, I cannot stay in touch with my previous form teacher in jc? Because now I have a new teacher and I must “move on” from jc? I am supposed to have a “clean break” from everyone who taught me in school just because I got a new professor? 

So If I make new friends in year two, I must “move on” from old friendships forged in year one? 

Did anyone say,you’re in NUS already, u should “move on” from poly and jc!! No. 
But people say, you should “move on” from past relationships, why? 

How does staying friends with people from my past (primary school friend /old neighbour /secondary school  friend) prevent me from being a good friend to other  university pals?  Do  I  have to cut ties  with former friends?!

If nobody says we should cut ties with former classmates after graduation, nobody says we should we cut ties with former teachers when we leave, why do so many people think the other way for ex lovers? Not ex Teachers, not ex colleagues, not ex classmates, but so specifically ex lovers?

When you are with him, you never respond to my texts. We stopped having long conversations. My phone stopped vibrating. We meet less in real life. I no longer have someone I can always be with, someone to cry to, and someone to spend all my time with. I’m lonely again.

I wish I can tell you how I really feel, but it would be rude of me to pull you away from your true source of happiness. I realise I am now forever second priority to him.

Meanwhile, I’ll just wait for him to be busy, then treasure every other time you have for me.

294,"Hi everyone, I’m contemplating divorce with my husband as I’m done pretending to be oblivious of his cheating ways. Honestly, this is something I’m extremely distressed about and I feel like I’m on a verge of a mental breakdown. There are days where I feel like I want to collapse but I have to continue putting up with the act. I know that if I want this divorce to work out in my favour, I would have to start collecting evidence. However, I am really distraught and am unable to start planning on how to do so. Anyone who has been a victim of cheating, could you kindly share some tips on how you manage to collect evidences and eventually confront your partner? I’m still in love with him which makes this so much harder but I know this is the right choice as his overcompensating acts of love are starting to disgust me. Also, are there any divorce support groups anyone could recommend me to join? While I know I have to deal with this, I feel like I could use a bit of emotional support. Everyday has been rough and I can feel my entire world crumbling before me.

296,"My gf and i have been together for close to 2 years. We started out as a pretty normal relationship, honeymoon phase the first 8 months then after this year started everything went haywire.

Since the start of this year she began behaving differently. I showed care and concern when she was at her lows but she still said that she didn't feel like i cared about her. She made demeaning remarks about herself which hurt me as well, i told her to stop saying those things but she never did. She made suicide threats and often said things like ""i should just go hang myself or jump off a building"", when she knows that i know people who have been in that situation but worse and it affects me closely. She had never trusted me with any of my friends of the opposite gender even after i made it official to everyone that we were together and distanced myself from other girls, even up to now. She didn't even trust her good friend from the same church to not try anything with me.

She started saying that i don't care for her at all, that no one gets her and that she is just a lonely person. I've been ready at my phone to listen to her and give her advice from her rants and be there for her, on some nights when she returns home late i ask that she send me a text to let me know that she's reached home safely. She still thinks i don't care for her. When i try to give advice i usually use my logic and common sense to give the best advice i can, yet it always seems to end up with her saying that i don't understand her at all.

Recently she also started talking about marriage, i told her that we should focus on our studies for now and think about it only when we are at a suitable age and can be financially independent. I was bombarded with questions of my commitment to her and whether i truly loved her.

What am i doing wrong? I know I don't express my emotions well similar to my family and my gf knows that side of me, she has a low self-esteem and this is the first serious relationship shes been in before. The only idea of how relationship works is from dramas which i've told her many times most dramas dont depict a true image of how a relationship works.

I'm tired of all this and I don't know if she will change. What do i do?

Basically 9/10 or 10/10 girls. It's easier to imagine it in doggie position, less so in missionary as I'm afraid my eyes will betray me with my expression or something. 

I love her very much that's why I married her anyway, but I can't shake off this guilty conscience during sex and keeping this secret for life is hard. Is this considered morally wrong? Or worse considered as cheating? I mean this how I keep my urge to cheat on my wife with other pretty girls in check, by using my imaginations during sex with my wife. Justifiable? 

Wonder if I'm the only one out there with this issue?

I have tried my best not to make any obvious advances as I know that she is in a fully committed relationship but it also sucks to know that I may have been already friendzoned. Honestly, now that the module we are taking together has ended, I can not avoid feeling slightly disappointed that I will not be spending time alone with her every week anymore. I tried to make small and imperceptible efforts like getting her food, inviting her for meals before CCA and accompanying her close to where her next class is. I know that I have to keep these feelings for her to myself even if I badly want to express it. I think and hope that such feelings will just disappear overtime.

He doesn’t really like to dress up - shirt, chinos and loafers kinda fashion, he’s more of the t-shirt, jeans and some trainers kinda person. I know he’s pretty thrifty when it comes to money, and we rarely dine at high-end restaurants. He usually invests most of his salary, and I’m a little worried. Do guys tend to not buy expensive gifts because they don’t know what females like? Or do they just not see the need to buy something nice for their partner once in a while? Does he not love me? 

I know it could be different love languages and whatnot, but I’m genuinely confused by this whole situation. He can spend money on getting a gym membership, going for upgrading classes and whatnot, but not spend some money just to get me one nice thing. All I really want is just something pricey from him though... I know it isn’t right to think this way logically, because he’s working hard for our future, but yet my emotional side is messing me up??

I’m afraid that my behaviour will take a toll on him. i m not sure if I’m toxic either.. i can’t help my insecurities. so yeah, do u think that i shld break up with him to let him find a girl not as problematic as i am? or shld i stick with him since he is willing to compromise w me? he is a very good guy, he is very proud and protective of me. however, because we r not official, on social media it seems as tho i do not have any boyfriend thus many guys constantly hit me up for my number, with that he doesn’t even make me block them he jus tells me to blow them off nicely… he’s a very decent guy and i love him so much so that i am willing to let him go and give him a chance to find someone better. not sure if its bc its my first time in love that i don’t know what i shld do and everything is by gut feeling? I’m scared that he doesn’t know what he is capable of receiving thus sticks w me :< tell me what i shld do pls and thank you for reading this :)

303,"I always thought it's attractive to see a guy who has some friends (like honest, healthy platonic friendships) of the opposite gender. Especially if you feel that his female friends are good people.

It's a great first indication that the dude knows how to treat a person as a person regardless of gender. It automatically makes me more comfortable around him because I would see that other girls are. I'd be more open to asking him out or to accepting an invitation for a meal, should he offer. I'd be more interested in getting to know him as an individual, basically.

Plus, I'd wanna met his friends. There's nothing more wholesome in girl talk than gushing about a guy whom everyone agrees is wholesome. Some people can say that can lead to complicated situations where multiple people pine after one poor sap. But that reflects more on the piners and their ability to manage conflict than on the person pined after, y'know? Not sure if anyone else agrees?

It's really mentally painful and depressing to desire what you cannot have. So, for years, I've been trying all sorts of means to suppress my attraction to good looking girls and to condition my mind to tweak my preference but nothing seems to work.

For example, i tried convincing myself that I'm attracted to a girl who actually isn't my type. Later on, I also told relatives and friends that I'm asexual in an attempt to trick my mind into accepting that I'm actually not attracted to the girls of my type, but that did nothing to help as well.

Since I am still halfway through my degree, I originally planned to elope after graduation in 2 years time. However, due to visa issues, my GF cannot stay in Singapore that long. In any case, her hometown is a small village so there are few jobs available for uni grads - even my poly diploma is probably overkill. I am confident that since everybody knows everybody in her village, there is no problem finding a job once I arrive. Frankly, I am not a snobbish like other Singaporeans, so I don’t feel the need to waste even more time just to get a useless piece of paper. The quality of education in NUS is not as high as its rankings suggest, so I wont be missing out on much. 

And yet... even though logic dictates that I should drop out of NUS, I am hesitating. Do I just not love my GF enough to make this sacrifice for her? Am I subconsciously being racist and judgemental like my parents? Or am I just a spoilt singaporean brat who prefers material comforts over true love?

I’m generally coping fine, I don’t really think of him much or miss him, and have no problems focusing on my work daily. But somehow after the breakup, I just feel like withdrawing from all social interactions and spending all my free time on my own. Even texting people feels like a chore nowadays and so I always take ages to reply, which I feel quite bad about. I lose interest to go out and meet people, even my close group of friends. Currently, there’s also this very nice guy who’s trying to get close to me, but while I’m trying my best to keep an open mind and just be friendly with him, I find our interactions very exhausting.
 I didn’t recall being like this after my past breakups, in fact last time I would try to engage in a lot of activities and constantly surround myself with people so as not to feel lonely and depressed.
Anyone experienced something similar before? Could this be symptom of depression that I should seek professional help about? I wonder how long it will take to be my normal self again, and whether it’ll get worse over time.

322,"Dear NUS students,

I am so happy that I discovered this NUSWhispers Facebook page. During my times at NUS 7 years ago, the page was called “NUS Confessions” (I remember that when it was created, it caused some controversy in conservative and prudish Singapore), and I was curious why the page had become inactive. I am glad to see that the NUS Confessions page has continued by becoming NUSWhispers.

I was an exchange student from Europe (I don’t want to give too many details about my country, as some people might recognise me) at NUS during the 2012/2013 academic year, and reading through the confessions makes me so nostalgic about my year abroad there. I wanted to share with you that this year has been unforgettable for me, probably the best in my life so far. I met some people who became my best friends, and met my first love there. Although we are not together anymore (thank you long distance relationship), we are still close friends and I still cherish today the memories of our times together.

I visited Singapore recently for the first time since I left in 2013, and it was such a pleasure for me to go back to the places where I had so many good memories : I saw that U-Town is now fully completed (and what an amazing place it is for students !). I also went back to the Foodclique food court at U-Town, where I had an Indian meal, which was my favourite. 

This meal was like a Proust Madeleine for me ; so many more forgotten memories came back to my mind as I closed my eyes and ate the fluffy and crispy roti prata and tasted the spices and textures of the briyani rice and flavourful curry and vegetables. Later on, I went back to the U-Town swimming pool (my old NUS card still worked, I didn’t expect that !), and watched with delight the sun set over the graduate residence towers and people chilling and playing together on the U-Town green, reminiscing myself with nostalgia that I was one of these people I was watching 7 years ago. I also took advantage of my stay in Singapore to walk and explore the hidden gems of the city.

Singapore truly feels like a second home to me, and it will forever be associated with the great memories of my youth years. I just wanted to share these memories with you via this post, and tell you that your country will always have a special place in my heart.

Sending you lots of love,

323,"I broke up 6 months ago with my one and only ex. We had a 4 years relationship. It has been smooth sailing until his time to serve NS came. I matriculated into uni, expanded my social circle a few times more than the one I had back when I was 18. Due to the lack of communication, meet ups etc, he started getting insecure which leads to his jealousy. But we still hung on till his ORD. Thought everything would carry on like how it did before he got into army and I got into uni, but somehow, things started getting worse. Even his mom came into the picture. She kept complaining about the number of male friends I hang out with. And although he always defends me, both of us knew that the relationship wouldn't work out if it continued this way so we came to a decision and broke up.

6 months have passed and I haven't gotten over him. My heart feels so empty. I miss his smile, his existence, his messages in the morning, his sweet gestures and all the effort he puts into the relationship. I still read his messages during my free time and look through our photos every other night. What made it even worse, since both of us applied and got into the same major, we constantly bump into each other on campus. He would be holding a cup of iced milo which I used to make him quit the coffee addiction he had during A levels. And every single time I take a glance, he would be wearing the watch both of us got for our 2nd anniversary. Since both of us separated on good terms, although we don't contact, he would still wave when our eyes meet but I'd always pretend that I didn't notice.

It's been 6 months and I still love him. The urge of getting back with him is really strong especially when I see him on campus, but my friends discouraged me from goimg back to him. I'm just really afraid he doesn't feel the same way anymore since it has been quite a while or what if he already has a girlfriend, since there is this girl who is frequently on his insta story. Or if we actually got back, the same problem would arise. I'm super conflicted. How?

Just needed to vent this out a bit

Quite a while back, I started dating this girl I met from Maplestory, but I recently found out that she was also dating some other guy in real life? I don't know if I'm over reacting to this but we even got married in game, and we talked alot even outside of the game, like on whatsapp and instagram. I thought that since we had something special even outside of the game, we were ""official"". But when I confronted her about it, she insisted that to her, in game relationships are a separate issue and that I'm not really her boyfriend?

I don't know why but I just felt so hurt by that because I always treated her special and finding out that she never felt the same way about me after all these months just hurts so bad.

Am I the only one who takes his relationships even in game seriously? I mean, if we never talked outside of the game I would maybe understand but it wasn't just ""in-game"" to me... I'm just so angry at myself for getting so worked up over something so stupid, and something that even she doesn't care about... I'm just so dumb...

Now we don't even talk anymore... maybe I should've left it as it is and let this carry on

In real life she pretends to be fine. However her replies are so cold to me now... Idk how to reply at all, or whether I should give her space, or continue the conversation as if nothing happened.

I'm so sad that I could have lost a close friend cos I didn't think abt the consequences of confessing :(

328,"Reading post #71864 made me feel very guilty, so here is a confession.

When I was 18 years old, I was horny (like many other teenagers) yet forced to stay at home to study for Alevels, so I started flirting with my domestic helper. Since her English was not very good, I was able to convince her to have unprotected sex. I was also able to convince her that letting me ejaculate inside her would be easier than having to wash the bedsheets all over again. Yes, I know I was wrong. I was a very selfish person back then. 

Eventually, her contract ended and she returned to her home country. Some time later, my family received a phone call from her saying that she was pregnant with my child. Imagine if you were a parent and a maid accused your son of fathering her child. Would you believe her? Of course not! I poisoned the well still further by making up false stories about her stealing money from my wallet etc.  Before long, my family was convinced that she had integrity issues. My family ignored her calls. Eventually, my father got fed up and scolded her over the phone, accusing her of lying, threatening to call the police and asking her to leave our family alone. The calls stopped after that. I was very happy and boasted about it to my friends and NS buddies. Eventually, everyone got bored with my story and I moved on to other conquests, so I kind of forgot about the entire incident. until recently.

Today, with the benefit of maturity and hindsight, I truly and sincerely regret what I did. As a married man now, I completely understand the difficulties involved in raising a child. I imagine that it is orders of magnitude more difficult to raise a child as a single parent. Originally, I intended to fly over to look at the child and confirm whether he is indeed mine before taking further action. However, on second thoughts, I realized that it dosent matter whose child it is: I had done a grave wrong, so I should make compensation irregardless. In addition to a significant lump sum payment, I intend to also sponsor the child’s accomodation, air fare and tuition fees if the child manages to get a place in NUS in a few year’s time. And I will NOT do any paternity testing.

This post is a reminder to all the other guys on NUSWhispers to do the right thing and treat their women well.

329,"My friend had just experienced a break up last Saturday with her boyfriend of 3 years. He cheated on her and dumped her but why isn't she sad? In fact, she is abnormally normal and I'm worried. The reason I say she is 'abnormally normal' is because other friends who have also been through a break up would either confide in me or rant about their ex without me asking, but as for her case, she functions absolutely normally. If I were to nitpick on her behavior, she laughs and smiles even more, talks even more, and she has a totally different vibe and I'm worried she is just putting up a facade so that people won't be worried.  Furthermore, I can see her puffy eyes even with those makeup. Whenever I asks if she is ok, she just shrugs it off casually. Or if I were to bring up the topic, she changes it immediately. I've been friends with her for 9 years and I know that she treats this relationship very seriously, and she has always been the kind who likes bottling up her feelings. So in this circumstance, I don't know how to comfort her or should I just pretend everything is alright.

331,"Mu parents have been overly sensitive about things. From banning me to get in relationships, putting curfews on me (1am), not allowing me to go drinking and on. This got me rather stressed and restrained and I'm not sure what to do. Even a simple meal with someone of the opposite gender will get them raging, thinking that I'm in a relationship with the other person and will reprimand me. 

Some might say since I'm living under the same roof as them,I have to just follow the curfews and stuff. I'll just let that be and in addition to that I even inform them about my whereabouts. But i find it constraining that I have to not go out with friends of opposite gender. Like hello I'm in university and I would say it's nearly impossible that you would not interact with people from opposite genders. I had no choice but to lie quite often, but there are times where they see me eating with my friends (SG is small so...). I cant even go drinking in peace. 

How can I convince them that I'm mature enough to decide my life without them interfering? 

I'm in a relationship as well, but I want to date my partner openly without having to hide him from my parents. If I were in his shoes I'll feel pretty upset about it.

332,"In JC, I came out of the closet as a gay man. At that time, I faced alot of discrimination from everybody: my parents were very angry with me, many of my friends left me and even random acquaintences whom I barely knew started giving me wierd looks. 

Since then, things have changed for the better. My parents are now accepting of my lifestyle, I made new friends (of course, my very best friends never left me) and I no longer care about what strangers think. I don't have the statistics to back this up, but I think that in recent years, Singaporean society in general has become less judgemental and more welcoming. Also, I would like to give special thanks to my very wonderful partner who has been very supportive during the past few years. Thank you, everybody. I couldn't have survived the past few years without your help.

The problem is this: I dont feel attracted to guys anymore. I have no problems performing in bed with my partner, but emotionally speaking I am just not into it anymore. On the other hand, I find myself attracted to girls around me. I also started a new cmb profile and matched up with a girl.  We may not have not had penetrative sex yet, but we have already progressed to the stage of kissing/heavy petting. I really want to pursue this new relationship further. To be perfectly honest with myself, I think that I was straight all along, and my homosexual inclinations were just part of my attention-seeking, teenage rebellious phase which I have since outgrown. I am sorry for all the emotional trauma that my parents and ex-GF had to suffer on my behalf. I am sorry for all the drama within my social circle. I wish I could turn back the clock. 

Should I come out of the closet again as a straight man? I really like this girl and I do want to take my new relationship to the next level. On the other hand, I am worried about what my friends will think. Also, in the past few years, I have helped out with advocacy efforts for the LGBT community in Singapore/NUS. I have also given advice to some of my juniors about LGBT matters. Today, even though I now consider myself a straight man, I still mantain close ties with the LGBT community and I am afraid of the community backlash if they find out the truth.

If true love does exist, then why do people fall out of love so easily? Why do people just willingly let go of everything in the past just like that? Is there even a point in trying to love anymore?

340,"Hey everyone, I am really at a loss in this relationship and I need your advice on how to move forward.

Let’s call him/her G. We have been together for a little more than a year. But it has not been smooth sailing. Back to the beginning, I met G while in my CCA. As time passed and we were practicing for our performance, I unknowingly fell for G. To find out more about G, I went to ask some of my mutual friends and their advice was that we are not suitable for each other. G was deemed as someone that is quite needy and needs much more attention and I’m considered to be the kind of person that is more independent and wants instead of needs in a relationship (idk how to explain also). 

Fast forward to after the performance, I was about to spend a semester overseas for exchange. At this point we are still not together but things were complicated where we went out on dates (guess we’re dating?) and flirted with each other quite a bit. But G is already quite possessive and does not like that there are two people that are opposite gender of mine in the group of friends i’m going on exchange with. I promised that I will not get too close with them even though i was close with one of them (Lets call him/her H. and H was a SA in a group where I was MGL). So off I went to my exchange and so the start of my hell (note that i was not together with G at that point). when my exchange started, G was behaving very bizarrely and getting upset at every little thing that i did. During the orientation party that my exchange school organised for all the exchange students, H got very drunk and could not get back to the dormitories on his/her own, other friends of that group were also not available because it’s either they went for second round or that he have to go back to the dorms earlier. So it was only H and me. The whole time our buddies and I only hold H until we reached the roadside and H just sat at the curb and fell asleep while i was looking everywhere for a cab while still making sure that H is safe. It was just entering spring and I have gave my coat to H so H will not catch a cold. I believe what I did was just being a good friend helping another friend out. But i was scolded and flared up upon by G for all the things i have done. Am i supposed to have left H there or what is another thing that i should have done because i really don’t know what i should have done.
Another time, the whole group of us went to get some street food and not wanting to spend too much money, the group decided to share some of the street food. In the end I shared my food (which is not even like a corn cob that kind where you have to “share” saliva with the other person) with H. I told G about this incident and even assured that nothing happened, yet I was bombarded with all the toxic scolding, it was like mental torture. I cannot really remember the exact things G said but I remembered that i was forced to keep my contacts with the two of them at the minimal. 
Then, there were even times where the whole group was deciding to go somewhere together but i just faked illness or tiredness to not go. Due to all these incidents, I have to cut all the contacts with H unless it’s for work or like formal stuff. Which i found ridiculous and like absurd. But in the end I obliged with it...  

Another thing happened during exchange that forever scarred me. While all the above were happening, G dares to say that G wants to go and meet with someone that G has a crush on. (I know, even i find it absurd when i read back what i typed). That incident ended with G saying it's his/her way of finding out whether he/she has feeling for me (like WTF). I was so sad when this happened that i went to a quiet place and cried while calling my close friend back in sg.

Another incident is that G went to visit a close friend at that person's hall (opposite gender) and the two of them drank in the room alone. Yet I am here having to cut my contacts with other people when I am hanging out in a group.

But i admit that i have done things that i promise i will keep my word but not kept my word. Things like keeping in contact with G as much as possible. Skyping G almost everyday for as long as i can. Im not saying that i dont want to do those things, but i dont think i should be scolded for not doing that sometimes, because of just how much i am already doing it.

By the end of the exchange, I realised i have only remember all the quarrels and scoldings and arguments and nothing much about the actual exchange. But i thought okay it will finally be over and yeah maybe G is just very sad that i go so far and for so long.

We eventually got together after I came back from exchange. But G started having issues with my other friends. particularly my closest friends from uni. In this group of friends, we are always without filters and always joke about very inappropriate things and thats how our group dynamic is, and we understand that what everyone in the group is joking about are just joking and no real intentions behind it. But G cannot take it and wants me to cut contact with those friends that i have hang out with since i started uni.
We already have a post graduation trip planned within the group and when i asked if i could bring G along, the group was not very fond of the idea because  they want the exchange to be with people they are really close with and because of what they have heard about G and how G treated me while i was on exchange. Again, the grad trip was a nightmare and much worse than what happened during the exchange. I was not happy at all during the trip, and many times i just stayed in the airbnb all day instead of going out with the rest, I hardly interacted with everyone and even when I went out with the group, I have to constantly take pictures to show that i am way behind and away from the group and not participating in the group conversation of whatever. I was in agony and it was the worst trip. 
Long story short, right now I have still not contacted them or met up with them since after graduation. 

G has always forced me through various ways that i am the one that f-ed up and G is the one that should the priority. I was made to make many promise about things that i dont even believe in if not the argument and quarrel will never end. I am so so sick of all these things happening. 

Right not, I have not contacted that group of friends. but recently I got interested in an activity and have been meeting around once a month with two other very very close friends of mine whom i knew from secondary school. Yet when i told G about this monthly meetup, G told me that it is a bit excessive to meet once a month. I was speechless. 

Another thing, I am currently working at a small company that hires quite a lot of interns. And when i tell G that i went for lunch with the interns, G will get so upset at me and ask me to go and have fun with them and dont talk to G. I am again at loss at work to do about . I am afraid that this will be problem that will just be there forever since i will have to work for another 20 to 30 years.

Another thing is that during my lunch, i am expected to reply G's messages straight away and must keep talking until my lunch is over, even if G is not replying me when i text. 

We are also have a lot of personality clashes such that G is always annoyed with the littlest things. I dont even remember what are the little things.

I am writing this long ass story because i am really really at a loss at what to do from here on. I really love G and I really hope things will become better but I am really feeling bleak on this. I hope the kind community here can give me some advice to steer me towards a decision instead of being stuck in this limbo now. 

TL;DR : Got together with someone, many problems, need help.

I realised as the time goes, the interest sort of died, and since there no indication of a romantic relationship (I am not sure how he felt as we have never discussed this topic before), I moved on.

I got to know guy B (2019) also on CMB. The chemistry was great. We aligned our values and I indicated that I was interested to give it a go (of course with marriage in mind). In fact, we got together within 1 month. 

I am not into those draggy relationship. I will indicate if I am interested, and I also don't play around with many guys to indicate interest as well.

As the old saying goes, if it doesn't work out, we can still be friends (but I know it usually don't work this way). Guy A still asks me out for dinner randomly, and he keeps sending me random pictures when he is on a holiday. The thing is, since he also never ever indicated interest, it is also kind of weird to reject him. But how can I put it in such a way so that it is clear that there is no chemistry between us?

You see, she isn't exactly independent and is rather reliant on her family for many things. Lucky for her, her family is well to do and the community around their Balmoral condo gives her a sheltered but happy bubble to live in. She has made known her desire to stay near her parents after marriage many times.

Yet, I am of the more independent sort and would rather we live away from both of our parents. Even though both of our parents are rich enough to buy us a condo, I would rather we use our own money (not much on her part since her job isn't very high paying) and get a nice cosy BTO. Her parents agree with me, but my gf doesn't. When I told her about applying for the Bishan BTOs that were mentioned in the news this week, she kicked up a fuss about how that would be so far away from her friends living in Balmoral and Bukit Timah. She was also daunted by the prospect of leaving her current sheltered bubble, which was exactly the reason why her parents and I think we should get a BTO. After all, she isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer when it comes to dealing with people outside her sheltered bubble.

Needless to say, this housing issue is causing a strain in our relationship. She has also hinted that staying in a BTO is a line in the sand for her. After much persuasion, she was open to the idea of living in Bishan or somewhere equally convenient, but she insists on it being at least a condo. I love her very much, but I am afraid I am at my wits end dealing with her princess syndrome. Is there any way I can resolve this problem without jeopardising our relationship?

355,"Hi I’d like to get some advice from you all. 

I’ll make it short. I’m a NUS alumnus. One of the (possibly) best things about my Uni life is meeting with this guy, who later became one of my close guy friends, whom I can confide in, especially when it comes to business, finance, relationship, life and stuff. Btw, we were from different faculties and we became friends after we first met for a CCA club. Later we found out on Facebook that we have quite a lot of mutual friends and our social circle is well connected. We had CCA meetings, gatherings, group outings, dance practices, and got closer to each other. We stayed in a NUS hostel (different blocks) and both enjoyed cooking. So, we didn’t run out of topics to text each other almost everyday during my year 1. We did more texting than meeting outside for just two of us. I could feel that he gradually showed some interest in me. Btw, I’m just an average looking lady but I think I’m sharp, hardworking, capable, kind, forward-thinking and very sociable. He is also smart, capable and average-looking (but I see him as a handsome guy). At times, he shared with me his past relationships. Maybe it was my mistake that I didn’t show him any obvious clues in return that I was also interested in him. 

So, he thought I didn’t like him and our texting became less frequent for a couple of months. We gave each other cold shoulders. Then I noticed he was chasing another younger girl and soon got into a relationship with her. We were still good friends but his then gf always speculated me and him whenever they quarrelled. To keep it short, they broke up after 2 or 3 years. (Disclaimer: the reason of their breakup was not related to me as I kept myself a distance from both of them. But he and I were still on talking terms as we had common activities.)

Some months later after his breakup, he texted me and we happened to catch up each other, and I could feel the same good old vibe being restored again. From that day on, we texted almost everyday though we were all occupied with our works and crazy schedules. Most of the things we talked about are no longer flirty, but rather sharing of each other’s life goals, career plans, family plans, finances and things that transformed us into mature individuals. Basically, both have turned into more capable individuals and started thinking about marriage — one of our common life goals. So, both are looking for a potential life partner to start a serious relationship with. He knows that I have some traits that make me wife material, and I also know that he is husband material. But we never talk it out directly to let each other know that we are the missing pieces for each other. We only show signals suggesting we can be a right match. 

So, the texting went on for a couple of months and I enjoyed it thoroughly. And just recently, I notice he’s become so caring towards me. He views my insta stories everyday and use them as a starter to chat with me. If he doesn’t initiate the conversation at our usual time due to his busy schedule, I then use his insta story to start chatting. 

Recently, he subtly hinted that we should meet up and catch up over dinner. So, we booked a date in advance for what both of us are available. 

Tbh, I’m in dilemma right now. Coz I’m not as hot as his ex-girlfriends, I want to know if he is really interested in me. If so, I’m ready to upgrade our relationship and go extra miles to fulfil each other’s goals. But if he is just flirting with me, I don’t want to waste my time for the wrong man. 

So, as a bystander, do u think he is interested in me? If so, in what ways should I deliver my signals that I’m also interested in him? Coz I heard that a guy tends to lose confidence and interest to pursue further if he doesn’t get any sign of assurance that the girl also likes him mutually. Btw, thank u in advance for any valuable advice ☺️

360,"I’m together with my boyfriend for 2.5 years but he has not shown me to his family members yet. They do not know about my existence. He claims that he is afraid, he doesn’t know what to do. And if I really insist of doing it myself by going up his house uninvited or whatever (damn extreme but just an example), he said it’ll damage his confidence and haunt him forever? He’s an introvert and I’m an extrovert. I really like the idea of spending time with his family together. I’m very family orientated and is very close with my family. My parents have already met him a few times but I don’t know how to get him to bring me to meet his. He kept insisting “next time” but how long do I need to wait? I asked him how long more, he just kept saying “don’t know” and kept changing the subject. I kinda want approval from his parents. Like a validation that this relationship will be long term, stable, real? Any advice? Am I the only one that thinks it’s important to meet the parents? Or is it not necessary to meet and I’m just stubborn? How to compromise to this?

Initially, I could go out on weekday nights to meet him for dinner, subjected to his availability as well. However, we are both getting busy, hence we are only able to meet each other on Fri after he books out till Sunday before booking in. Sometimes, I feel sad, especially when I'm alone studying in school, that he is not around with me. And also when I look around at other couples in school, I get a little jealous. Even when we meet during the weekends, I would be studying while he would be using his phone/computer. I feel like we no longer have a proper time to just simply enjoy each other's company and just do nothing.

Can any guys tell me what is the best way to let him know that it's not going to work between us, and preserve the friendship? (Better cut it short than giving him a false hope)

It doesn't help that we don't stay/work at the same area which means I would have to ask him out first in order to tell him this bad news. But I can't go 'Hey, thanks for coming out. I just want to tell you that unfortunately it's not working out for us. So uh, yeah. That's all. Bye ya'.

363,"I really need some advice here. No troll comments, please.

This girl and I met during camp. She had a bf then, but we still texted and met quite often. One day, I confessed to her and she broke down. She felt happier with me and had feelings for me. But what was holding her back from her ex was time(they were together for 2years). To be honest, I was prepared to leave because I dont want to be a third party. 
For the next 2 months, we spent almost every day together(except Saturday and Sunday). The time we spent together, we did share intimate moments(kiss, hugs etc). When she was sick, I would buy medication for her. I would also often buy her favourite food etc. Even when we eat out, I would often pay for our meal. During these 9 weeks, she eventually broke up with her bf. 
So, after 1 weekend, everything changed. Her replies got slower(this was not the same week she broke up with her bf). We had a lot of quarrels about texting etc. She didn’t care as much. There were a lot of red flags, but I chose to believe what she told me. Another week past and I went to find her (she stays in school). The usual bought her favourite food etc, hoping to surprise her. I was in her room for about 40minutes (which she knew cause I texted her) before she came back from her friend’s room. I confronted her about the whole situation and if she liked someone else. After much hesitation, she said yes. My heart sank.  
Till now, I still cannot comprehend the situation. How can someone change of heart so fast? After all the vulnerable moments we shared together. She barely knew the guy, but she already chose to forget everything that happened? I had so many plans; her birthday, after exams etc. But I guess it’s all a waste now. 
I know that time will heal everything but as of now, thoughts of suicidal are constantly in my mind, especially since I know she is enjoying her time with him. After everything that happened, I just feel like I was being used. I tried distracting myself by studying but I cant concentrate. I often skip meals these days cause I just don’t have the appetite. Sometimes I feel like being the nice guy doesn’t get you girls.

But I'm just wondering if there any truth in either of these? What should I do? 

Some of the habits that triggered this discussion was the dirty toilet sink, sleeping with the aircon at 18 degrees, walking around half naked, not keeping games immediately once done with them.

Sometimes I wonder if you ever felt walking away was a mistake. We cared for one another and loved another deeply, albeit through vastly different forms. I can confidently say we still love one another, but perhaps in a more mellow, subtle, distant manner now. 

Sometimes it's tougher to get over someone when there was no dramatic ending - no cheating, no falling out of love. Rather, a clash in personalities and perhaps life goals and timing. Anyhow, hope you've been well, love. Stay healthy and happy, please. That's my greatest wish for you. xx.

370,"I met this charismatic guy back then. He always knew the right words to say, be it to advise, to comfort, or to reassure me. Perhaps it was because he is a lot older than I am.

I fell in love, and so did he. He was straightforward when confessing his feelings, and I was blown off my feet not knowing what to expect in my first relationship; because of our age gap we hid our relationship. We could only meet in his home, or drive around aimlessly, & what else can you do in these places....

This went on for a year until i found out that i was a third party. I was shocked, and betrayed, but mostly found fault in myself for being so gullible to a man’s sweet talk.  

I avoided him for weeks but my determination to stay away wavered as he confessed that he was out of love with her - and only stayed due to her suicidal tendencies. Well, who am i to stop someone in a situation like this? Yet my heart still longs for him. 

It didn’t help that we still met occasionally due to mutual friends. In the silence and distance, i would still grab his hand whenever he holds it out to me. A cycle of attraction, guilt and heartbreak - at least for me. 

At the back of my mind, i was always suspicious of his real intentions. Was he lying to me? Was i being used? How many more secret relationships is he hiding?

Eventually i couldn’t take this overthinking and completely shut him off my life - even after a year, when he reached out to say he has finally been freed from his relationship. 

Not long after, our mutual friends told me that he wasn’t ok, almost depressed even, and they didn’t know why. All this while, i didn’t dare believe that it was because i left - because he had so much going on for him, and i really didn’t feel like i was much of a priority in his busy schedule. 

This all happened a few years back. I’ve mostly moved on but once in a blue moon, certain events still trigger memories and erupt unpleasant uncertainties in myself. I guess i never got the closure i needed, nor know for sure if my first love was an unfortunate love story or a miserable lie. Maybe the worst part is, i could never breathe a word about this to anyone i know. 

I have zero intent of getting back together, yet i don’t know why this bugs me so much... genuine thoughts & advice appreciated.

373,"I just don't really get the concept of modern dating. Especially with the emergence of online dating apps, there are just too many options and many people are dating more than 1 person at any one time. 
Having gotten out of a few bad relationships in the past, I went to on to experiment with online dating apps, thinking that maybe dating / talking to a few people at a time would be kind of fun and would allow me to form better judgements since I would not be blinded to only one person that may be a bad fit. However, eventually I decided that the concept of ""dating a few people at once"" doesn't sit well with me. I don't get how is that will work out cause I think it gives the illusion that you have so many other backup options that you needn't put in much effort in any one of them? And it eliminates the fear of failure?
So I deleted the app after finding one guy that I decided to focus on. We went on a few dates and we do like each other, though we are both not ready and not sure enough to commit for a serious relationship yet. But the problem is, even though I am dating him exclusively, he is dating a couple of others because he too, had a couple of bad relationships in the past and now he is not sure of what he wants yet and doesn't want to settle down easily. I understand what he means because it makes logical sense but I couldn't help feeling upset that I am not the only one he is dating. It's like I am feeling special at one moment, but the feeling disappeared and was replaced with a heartache when I  remembered the fact that I am not the only one! 
I am having so many inner conflicts between my heart and my mind now. Should I stick around with him and date other people too (I mean that's practical right?) Should I continue dating him exclusively, give my best shot to it and accept it if it doesn't work out in the end, or just drop it and find somebody else who is willing to focus on only me and give me a shot?
I really think that this modern dating world is kind of screwed up. People nowadays are getting more picky and afraid of commitment to the extent that it's so difficult to find a partner now, isn't it? Or maybe I am the delusional one who is willing to put myself out there to get hurt.

I have a HUGE problem. I am constantly horny and I can't handle my urges that well.

So I am in a 1 year relationship with my boyfriend. He is a nice guy, gives me attention as much as he can, because he is working most of the time, I would then go on and hang out with my friends a lot. Didn't help that most of my friends are guys.

My ex at that time was manipulative although loving but i didn't want to continue being with him. Fortunately, managed to break things off with him.

So back to my 1 year relationship, i almost cheated on him with some other people but i really held back because this time I thought maybe I will indeed feel guilty so better not cheat.

But then I still feel like cheating because it's what I had been doing all this time. I feel like shit. What do I do?

I never thought of myself as a 'love at first sight' kinda person but we locked eyes and just knew. Immediately. The most memorable moment was when there was a night when everyone else was distracted doing something and we sneaked off to lie on a field together looking at the stars.

Since then it has been four great years. We both recently graduated this May and have just about embarked on our careers now. Of course with beginning real adult life comes all the usual considerations about moving in together, how and when to start a family given our circumstances, where to have our wedding outside of Singapore, etc.

I guess the honeymoon period is over of course and now is the time when real considerations take over. Like S. is Muslim and I'm Catholic, so any kids we are able to raise eventually we'll have to think hard about how to educate them on religion. We both also have different countries in mind that we want to emigrate our to-be family to eventually...we'v'e debated this for years and argued about it many times with no conclusion.

I really love him but lately it just seems like all these problems are stacking up one after another. I think the biggest wedge issue at the moment is that he really wants me to convert to his faith. I've not been super devout in recent years (long story) and I'm almost willing to convert just to be with him, because he means that much to me. There's just one problem: I'd have to cut my manhood. You know as it's sort of part of the rules. And I'm not sure if I can through with all that, and how much compromise I'm willing to make. Compromise after compromise until when?

386,"Early last year, I met this guy through a mutual friend and we clicked instantly. Back then he just moved back to Sg after working overseas for a while, to help out with his family business. We eventually got together, and that was when he opened up more and I started noticing that I wasn’t comfortable with his lifestyle and habits. I found out that apparently he wasn’t doing much for the business and pretty much bummed around the whole day. He also spent many sleepless nights playing poker and boasted to me how his few days of earnings from poker can even exceed my monthly salary. He’s from a very rich family and basically behaved like a spoiled kid even at his age (late 20s). He bought me expensive meals and gifts but I knew it was either using his parents’ money or from gambling and it made me feel uneasy. I broke up with him after a few months for all these reasons and he was furious, as he accused me of not loving him enough to give him chance to improve before dumping him. Vicious words were exchanged, and the immature way he handled the breakup (he even threw my phone across the room) made me hate him even more. 

Few weeks after the breakup, he started contacting me again, thanking me for teaching him an important lesson despite all the hurt and he said he’s working towards becoming a better person. Soon, he shared with me that he had secured a decent job. He stopped gambling completely and spent the time working out and learning new skills instead. He sent me gifts on my birthday and souvenirs from his holiday trips. Again and again he expressed his appreciation to me for inspiring him to lead a more fulfilling life and saying how badly he wanted to see me now. However, never once did I respond to him. Even when we happened to bump into each other once and he called my name several times, I pretended not to see him. My heart was still cold remembering the spoiled kid that he used to be, I refused to believe that he indeed has changed.

Fast forward about 1.5 years to today, he still contacts me from time to time. I guess time really heals, I no longer have bad feelings for him now. In fact I felt kinda guilty for ignoring him all these while. So I was just thinking whether it’s weird if I suddenly respond to him now (he just texted again recently), apologise for my lack of response so far etc and try to be friends with him? Should I be open to the idea of starting a relationship with him all over again if he’s still keen, now that he’s a changed person? My worst fear is that he’ll go back to his old ways one day and disappoint me again, am I thinking too much here?

390,"I feel extremely lonely. I have friends, close friends, with whom I hang out. I am reasonably social. I take part in CCAs and stuff.  But I crave for something more than friendship. It’s not sex but more like intimacy and exclusivity. Even when I am in a crowd or hanging out with my friends I feel lonely. 

Background - I have only been in one relationship that lasted a couple of months in 2016. I am a virgin and I haven’t dated anyone since. 

My issue is even when I hang out with my friends, especially female friends, I always have this feeling that we will never be more than friends, since most of them are already attached. I feel like I am the only one with nobody in my life, nobody consistent. That my life has no stability because of it.  And that makes me feel miserable. 
I’ve tried to distract myself from this feeling by focusing on studies, hobbies etc but it does not last. I can’t keep it up anymore. This loneliness is killing me. 

Sometimes I even contemplate taking my own life and when I think of that the first question that comes to mind is ‘would anyone really miss me if I did it?’ and for a long time I’ve tried to convince myself that there are people in my life who would miss me but I am not entirely sure I can keep up this lie. And if the day comes where I can no longer convince myself that someone would miss me then I am fairly confident that, that is the day I will end up killing myself. 

My question is what can I do about it. It’s a very specific problem. I just want someone in my life who I care about, who cares for me, with whom I am exclusive with. I want to feel loved and secure, something that cannot happen with just friendship. 

I have tried dating apps but with no success. I find it so meaningless and tiring and I hardly get any matches and even those who do match hardly ever reply. I don’t even know if getting into a relationship is the right move at this point, even if someone ever wanted to date me, because I feel like now I am more in love with the idea of a relationship than with the person I would be in a relationship with. 

What do I do? I want to stop feeling this way. I can’t go on living miserable like this.

Seeing their lovey dovey pictures in Instagram just make it worst for me. So I started using Tinder. A lady started chatting and we went out. She is older than me by like 10 years and is a divorcee (no kids though). After the second date, she invited me home to watch Netflix shows. As you know we did everything except watching Netflix. Soon we didn't even go out, usually straight to her house (she lives alone with her aunt, I am still living with my parents). Long story short, I had the intention of proposing to her to be my girlfriend. Age is just a number though. Just when I am having such thought, she asked, ""do I mind if her aunt join in"", in one of our ""sessions."" Now this is weird, I always thought relationship is to marry and settle down but it seems now there is no true love. She is just interested in satisfying her sexual needs. Just feel sad whenever I see my uni friends are marrying their uni sweethearts. If only my ex didn't meet her Ang Moh colleague .......

So, here's the thing. He is more high drive than me. I have no qualms giving it to him when he ask for it. And when I say no he respects that. 
The thing is, because he is more high drive, he initiates it more often (like 99% of the time?) and I rarely initiates it. Not that I don't have a desire for it. But, Because the frequency (of his initiation) is already higher than my frequencies of desires, that’s why I rarely initiate it. 
So, for me sex is not as exciting now cos it is done without me having an internal ""desire"". We just do sex but I am not able to give my best because internally I am not “fired up”. 
I don’t think he would like it if I reduce the frequency, but I honestly think it wld help with that part of our life because it would get me more excited and involved and perform better?
Does anyone have a similar problem of varying sex drive and how to deal with it? Am I right to ask to reduce the frequency or shld I just continue with the flow?

407,"I matriculated in NUS earlier this year into Biz and like many other freshman,  I was eager to meet new people. I joined several camps and rag but I realize that I could not really click with the people around me, for whatever reasons, but I still made ""friends"" nonetheless. I also really wanted to meet more girls and hopefully find some who were down for some fun, casual relationships but to no avail. So I decided to use tinder instead. I was swiping one night and I matched this girl who was down to netflix and chill, but I did not stay on campus so I prayed that she had a place. Lucky enough, she was alone in singapore as she is a malaysian studying at a private uni here and so she rented her own place. Staying in the west, I cabbed all the way down to the North East Region. We carried out the deed and before I left, I caught of glimpse of her phone (unintended) and I saw that she received a message from a guy asking what she is up to etc. I did not think much about it and just left. 

This casual relationship carried on several times and I started to get suspicious as she would often peek at her phone to reply messages, even in between the deed. So I decided to ask her whats up, and she tells me that she is actually in a relationship with a guy for quite some time. Here are some of the details and this is where it gets interesting.

1) She previously stayed at a hostel near her uni and would meet up with other guys, even though she was attached to the boyfriend. Till this point, they have not slept together.
2) She decided to move to stay near the boyfriend and that was when they started being physically intimate.
3) The boyfriend matriculated the same year as me, was also in biz (I told her I was in Engineering), and also did rag. 

At this point of time, I tried to keep my cool and just left after knowing it all. Firstly, I felt bad for sleeping with someone who was attached even though it was consensual. Secondly, there might be a possibility of knowing the person (even though biz is quite big). I am no saint but I felt terrible. 

Then one fine day when I checked my telegram, she blocked me. And I forgot about this whole incident till I saw a familiar face on instagram. It was the girl and her boyfriend. And I knew the guy.

So should I be a bro and tell this friend of mine? Or just let her carry on cheating behind her boyfriend's back?

tldr; hooked up with a girl who was attached and the boyfriend happened to be in the same year and major as me. help a brother out or nah?

Actually frankly speaking, that girl I date, she is looking for the same thing like me. Someone that loves her for life and not just for sex. She is way more traditional than I thought 

Only if she has really seen me someone she wanted to be for life and not just her money tree, I am willing to accept her. Despite I sit with her for so many months, I still did not get this trust for her that I wanted her just for sex 

Anyway, she has gone back to Thailand but my stance and feelings has never changed at all. If she can be more openly trusting to me and I know she do cares for ppl, my time spent with her is pretty incredible. I never used to think so much on family and on my income but eventually, I want her to see that I am serious of being with her and she can open her heart in telling me everything

I’m the ex gf that was contacted by a friend who knows his supposedly most recent gf. My friend came to me for help to persuade her to break up with him. So we contacted and managed to uncover the lies and his cheating doings. We officially broke up on 18 August 2019 and he was together with her on 21 August 2019. He started dating her in May 2019 (believed to be the period when I was overseas). I was together with him for 6 months (19 Feb’19- 18 Aug’19) and he told her that his last relationship was 2-3 years ago, when it was more like 2-3 days ago. 

In summary, the main “issues” of the relationship revolves around:
1. Monetary issues - Over paying of meals, the wear and tear of his prized possession a BMW 335i that he doesn’t pay season parking for on some months and tailgate other cars out. And I even paid for his season parking for 2 months cause I couldn’t bear to see him having to wait and tailgate other cars out. 
2. Staying over at each other’s place 
3. Physical touch because we didn’t sleep with him thank god 

He mentioned that he hate cheaters and that he will never cheat because it’s low and just not his style. So apparently if what he said was true I assume he hates himself then. The relationship went downhill apart from the usual quarrels over the 3 main issues when I wasn’t able to help him achieve his goal of the 2019 to get a Rolex Hulk. He wanted me to use my credit card to get him the Rolex and he claims that he will pay me back. I didn’t agree to it and he started making a fuss, verbally abusing me for being selfish. Eventually, I couldn’t take it anymore and I broke up with him. 

After we broke up he still IG message on and off saying that he miss my dogs and me, despite being attached. Asking if he is still my dog’s dad while I find a replacement. He also tried to ask me out a few times to “thank me” but honestly thanks but no thanks. 

Breaking up with him was the best decision I made this year. Through this incident, we come out to be bestie having been through the same torment.

So this all started from my group of friends who have teased me about liking this girl, from here on referred to as Susan, since the beginning of this year. I have only talked to Susan a few times in the past 2 years but from my very limited interactions with her I feel a strong desire to get to know her better as a person, and I do hope that something romantic arises between the 2 of us. 

However, she is currently studying in abroad in an elite school and I fear that I am not good enough for her as I think she is going to be very successful in the future whereas for myself, I feel that I am unable to hold a candle to her in terms of academic achievements. In addition to this, I feel like may be unable to adequately provide for her in the future should anything happen.

We do share some hobbies though, so I think that that is one of the ways in which I could approach her when she eventually returns or when she comes back on spring break. Unfortunately my friends would also be around on such occasions and I feel extremely uncomfortable approaching her around all of my friends. 

So how should I approach her?

Just a update, we broke up, and he tried to patch things back by saying how I’ve left the relationship too early, and I was being selfish because he was always there fighting for our relationship while I was complacent. Despite all my friend’s advise I felt guilty and I wanted to go back to him. That was when my friend noticed that he looks familiar, and my friend actually knows his ex gf. I reached out to her, and she actually told me the real story they broke up. He told me that he was single for 3 years and the reason they broke up was because he still had feelings for his first GF, and he wasn’t ready to be in a relationship and that’s why they broke up. 

The ex GF side of the story: They also had monetary issues, about how he was always paying for things while she didn’t. But the actual fact that she paid for their trips, payed for his season parking and his insurance. How he also asked her to buy a Rolex watch for him. And how he blamed her for not pulling her weight in the relationship, and how he was always the one holding the relationship. He also mentioned to her that “in a relationship it was important to be physical, and if there wasn’t, he was pretty sure that the relationship will not last.” (He said the same thing to me too, but thank god we both didn’t sleep with him) he also told her that he hates cheater and he will never be that low life that would cheat. She also told me how he would always guilt her into buying things for him. And into staying in the relationship. 

He told the both of us that his last relationship was 3 years ago. Here is the kicker, they (the ex gf and him) broke up on 18 July and we officially started dating on 21 July. Which means that he was still attached when we started seeing and getting to know each other. 

Needless to say I didn’t feel guilty for dumping his sorry ass. AND, after all of these drama at least I came out with a new bestie who knows exactly what I’ve went thru. <3

I'm content with my single lifestyle, having hobbies that I can immerse myself in and a small group of close friends that I usually hang out with. 

However, I am starting to wonder if I am missing out on major milestones. A lot of people in NUS seem to be attached, and from what I know, many people of my age have dated at least once. Sometimes my friends would share stories of their significant other, while I would quietly and cluelessly listen (because of obvious reasons. lol).

While I am open to the idea of dating a girl while studying, I am not actively looking for a partner (not that it makes a difference; I don't club nor drink so maybe people would perceive me as boring? I don't know how clubbing is fun but that's a separate issue altogether). I did try Tinder just for the sake of having dating experience, but I deleted the app the next day after downloading it because it felt way too toxic for me (I don't know why sugar daddies are so popular among girls there but... sure).

Is anyone experiencing the same thing as me? I wonder if I would still be single till I die...

434,"Long story ahead(p.s not good at writing so sorry for my mistakes) : 

4 years ago, I started a relationship together with  this wonderful girl, she was kind, caring, compassionate and always by my side. 
However back then I did not know how to love, I have never really loved anyone in my life before. And throughout the first half of the relationship, I have cheated on her mentally and physically, been on tinder, flirted over and over, I was also abusive back then when we argued very badly. I am considered a class S Jerk? (At least thats how I feel about myself.)  All these young dumb and stupid mistakes were made and its going to haunt me all my life.

Throughout the relationship she found out about all of the above and wanted to break up, but I managed to convince her to stay and she always forgave me and stood by me no matter what and before long, I finally learned to love her with all my heart, not a single day goes by where I dont regret what I did in the early parts of my relationship and I really genuinely wanted to change for the better, she shaped me into a better person and I kept trying to be better because I want a future with her so badly.

Fast forward to this year, I got injured and so it was rather uneventful, we couldnt do much together as a couple, but despite that she always stood by me and I wanted to make it up to her after my surgery, I planned 3 surprises for her birthday, looked at overseas trips, planned christmas surprises and was actually saving up for an engagement ring on the side so that I can propose after NS (by then it would be 6-7 years in the relationship) and I honestly felt like this year was one of the better ones, we were happy or so I thought.... 

Then we started working part time together, during our time there, one of the guy was very friendly with her kept chatting her up and they texted excessively as well..despite me  expressing my discomfort, it didnt really change things. A few weeks later, we argued and honestly this arguments wasnt even one of the biggest we ever had and that very weekend I had to undergo surgery for my injury, and the week after, she still cared for me the same, but before long, I got the cold treatment, I could tell something was off but I couldnt put my finger on it. 

The next weekend, during one of the days she was out and mia-ed for hours, from 7 - 12 am, I was so worried something wouldve happened to her and I couldnt do anything because I was recuperating at home, when she texted again at 12, I was so relieved and mad at the same time, I chided her for going missing and before long she broke up with me saying the past 2 arguments was the last straw for her, I didnt want to break up so I arranged a f2f talk the next day and wanted to convince her to stay, but she was adamant and breaking up isnt a 2 sided thing, when one side decides its over, theres often nothing you can do about it. And so I tried the next best thing, I asked to stay as friends because even if we can't be together, I still want to be happy with her, share her upsets with her even as a friend, I want to stand by her and I know I will be content and maybe I could still execute all the surprises that I had planned.. 

She agreed initially, which was something good, but I was in misery, I was distraught, depressed.. Iam glad we were still friends but the fact that we arent together anymore killed me.. I wanted to talk to someone after the breakup so I went onto dating apps and tried to talk to people, get different perspectives from strangers who made it easier to ask for advice because they didnt know me.

She found out that I was on those apps again and she instantly blocked me off all platforms saying she wants nothing to do with me ever again, and so there goes my chance of even being her friend.

I tried asking her to meet again to talk, in hopes of salvaging something but she wouldnt see me, she agreed initially because my family contacted her and backed of last minute... So I tried, I went to get some of her favourite cake and travelled all the way down to her work places in my crutches post surgery in hopes that we could talk over the cake and still be friends at least, but no she didnt want to see me at all and had her friend send me away.. 

Before long, the guy which I mention from work told her that he is the right one for her..kind of a low blow if you ask me, but coincidence? I dont know, but I knew I was right to be uncomfortable and now, they are out together a lot.. Then again who is to blame other than me? I was the one that caused the cracks and created the opportunity to exist in the first place.

But even so, my love for her doesnt change, I will always love her even if I cannot be by her. Until today, I still cry my heart out each night (kinda serves me right dont you think? Karma comes around. ) But my heart only has the capacity to love her and I dont think I will ever love again unless its her and right now all I can do is to respect her wishes and stay away from her, as long as shes happy, I guess its worth it. 

Whats the point of this story? Well recently, I have been diagnosed with depression and had a few rough episodes, truth is I dont really know what to do, I guess maybe by confessing my past sins and sharing this story on this ""confession"" platform might help me deal with it... Like how people always confess their sins in their religion..

But I also hope this story would also help all of you out there in a relationship, hold on to it dearly like each moment is your last, love each other like theres no tomorrow and dont make foolish mistakes that will haunt you.. And to those not being in a relationship, only be in one when you are ready... Because love can go away so quickly in a blink of an eye and by then it will be too late for regrets. Trust me, I learnt it the hard way. 

I know this story has more than enough details for you to identify that I am talking about us, and in the small chance that you happen to read this post, I apologise in advance if it makes you feel uncomfortable or upset that I am sharing it, it is not my intention to add to your discomfort. Also I havent seen you in a while and I hope you are happier, bear in mind that I will always love you though we are no longer together and that you are always my first and happiest thought whenever I need to produce a patronus

435,"I have been in a relationship with my bf ever since half a year now. I've understood that he is a goal oriented and intellectual man and those were the things that made me love him even more. On our first few months he was quite agressive for being sweet and attentive to me. Always making sure he replies to my messages and attends to my concerns. He is a very sweet guy hence I fell even more. We matched when it comes to intellectual conversations as well as simple ones too. And we've travelled to quite some places already around asia and will be planning to go to a lot more. In fact have booked our upcoming holidays too.

But just about 2 months now, he's been indulging himself with so much studies and stress that I still try my best to cheer on him. He's on his university studies and while I'm working, I am fully dedicated to waiting for him to finish studies and we can start building our lives together.

The thing is, he is so busy. Straight up ???? % attentiveness now to just 10%.. I don't know what happened to him but he often just seenzones my messages for the whole day, and he still wouldnt agree to post our photos online... Its been months since we started dating and I would always wonder why he wouldnt post our couple photos. He does say he love me and is pretty invested on me. And I would like to just believe it. Cause requiring him a lot would mean additional stress with his studies right?

I have tried to fit myself to him and his standards as per his request, but now that he's busy, I only asked for him to post our photos as a sign to let people see he is busy + committed. Something to make a girl feel secure and happy. I even reinstated that I wanted to be posted on social media as for various reasons but he really just doesnt wanna do it. I feel so broken and felt like an option only...


Correct me if I'm wrong but, most girls would want to be shown off on social media too isn't it? Am I giving too much to him since I've changed my interests and tried to understand his university schedules? I even go find him a lot of times when all he does is just to call at night to say goodnight. His reason is that he will just make it up to me on our travels but still insist a silent treatment on not posting our couple photo on any social media platform. No attention + hidden relationship = total anxiety eating me. 


If you were the guy, would you rather compensate just so you wouldnt loose your girl? How will you make it up to her on your very busy schedule? Any tips? I'm trying my best to save a dying relationship and all he say is we don't have a problem and I simply have to believe him. Is that enough to stick by?? Pls. Help. 


P. S. I would like to disclose that I often get compliments about how pretty I am and how people used to wonder why I'm single a year ago. So I don't see any point of him rejecting me or feeling cold towards me.

P. P. S. Considering my looks and university degree plus my attentiveness towards him, I don't know if he is just making me an option or is he already cheating on me?

437,"My first apology for I am not a native English speaker. I just had a crush on someone else while dating my girlfriend.

I have been in a relationship for 2 years and my GF went to study abroad lately. She is overwhelmed with assignments and we hardly talk to each other, maybe once a week, sometimes less. We will still be in this distance relationship for a couple of months more. 

I was okay with that until I came across another girl lately, she was warm and caring and that just made me realize how not fulfilling my relationship has been. The chemistry, the emotion is not there like in our first days. I am not thinking of breaking up (yet) but I am not sure how long I can keep up with these issues unsorted out.

I intend to be honest with my GF about my feelings, the coldness of our relationship and see how we can fix it together but I am afraid I will hurt her. I tried to open this up indirectly a couple of times but she was not very interested to find out what I am really feeling.

I know my GF is very busy with her schoolwork and we both have a plan for our long-term commitment already. And the crush I am having won't last long anyway, I found out the other girl is relocating to another place soon (needless to say, I am sick of starting another distance relationship). Yet, having a feeling for another girl teaches me how my relationship does not fulfill my emotional needs.

Anyone in the same situation before? What did you do?

440,"hi guys, i need advice to REALLY get this message across: birthdays are important to me and when he doesn’t celebrate mine, our relationship takes a serious beating.

i’ve told him those exact words over the past 3 years but it’s really clear he doesn’t get it. we’ve argued over it and i’m always the first to let up because he has a knack of wiggling his way through any convo. 

some background:
over the past 2 years, my birthday has been less-than-ok because of him. the first year a failed gathering which i didn’t even know it was for my birthday until only after when he told me (no one wished me, no cake etc.); the second year, i observed him do nothing at small gathering w fam, he didn’t take charge or help out or contribute in anyway, just existed there where convenient. it rly made him look like a bum.

and this year i thought maybe things would change? not really. i had already lowered my expectations alot. tbh it was really as simple as cutting a slice of my favourite cake with him, or eating something new tgt. but i received a grabfood uncle with two slices of melted cake, which melted even more throughout the day. we both had classes that day so we didn’t plan to meet (apart from a 1 hour class in the morning and aft, i was actually free and i guess low-key waiting for him to show up), although turns out he didn’t even go for his, he just kind of lazed around at home.

he’s part of those ‘birthday-is-just-another-day-and-somemore-i-already-do-thing-for-you-on-other-day’ kind of people, which i really can understand. but if you know i ride alot of hopes on this day and literally any sign that u put in some effort into appreciating me will have 10x multiplier effect today, why is it so hard to just bring me out for nice dinner? or agree to do a small thing that i like to do that u don’t really like tgt?

i believe love is a verb and even though i know he loves me, i don’t feel appreciated or loved.

it’s such a stupid thing to get worked up over and i’ve been trying to supress this disappointment i feel. i guess NUSWhispers is where it resurfaces. so thanks all for listening.

We’ve been sitting down talking about expectations very often as both of us are in a different life stage; I’m working full time and studying night class and she is currently studying. Despite laying expectations and understanding, the debate and quarrel usually is about the same thing and for our case one quarrel usually leads to another and it gets worse sometimes.
Sometimes its about replying about 5 mins slow, which is consider slow for her. As my timing is spread out for work,study and personal life,  its very hard for her to understand that most of the time despite sitting down talking about it. 

i have to admit sometimes i do want some time off just to sleep which will also affect her. We do meet up to sleep but weekends are fully planned and all out for dating and all but its still insufficient. 

Frankly speaking its quite tiring to always apologise and coaxing her when she always pick on tiny bits like replying slow of 5 mins. I want the relationship to continue but at this rate, how to accomplish better goals together when all this small matter is always there?

In the first month of dating we had issues about me having a curfew (i used to need to be able to go home by 11pm-12pm), but we settled this issue now i can hang out till 2-3am no issues. Second month of dating, issue was on money, he feels like he is always paying for expensive meals (which happens maybe once a month), while i always pay for cheaper meals like drinks, desserts and hawker center food or cafe and lower end restaurants.  To be fair if he pays for dinner i will pay for dessert vice versa. And this month we argued about we not being able to stay over at each others house, how i cant be spontaneous and meet for supper on weekdays or be physically there when he needs me. To give a little background, we are both working adults i am getting a fixed salary while he is doing freelance, i do try to be supportive we will always talk over the phone on each other's bad days till late at night, and will meet 3-4 times a week. I do try to plan activities for us, like date nights or even asking him to come have dinner at my place or me going over to his place to have dinner after work. Is this me not putting in effort?

446,"It is concerning how our society treats porn as a normality. I have been an avid user of porn or in stricter terms, a porn addict, during my younger years and was disillusioned about how sex should be. I started objectifying women and developing weird fetishes such as feet fetish. Like a chain smoker who feels crazy withdrawal symptoms every few hours without a cigarette, I feel an uncontrollable itch to start searching for stimulation on the Internet every time I was alone. The ability to get different stimulations easily with a new tab each time only made my addiction worse. After the usual gets boring, there would always be new fetishes to help me finish. After about ten years, I find myself numb from sex and unable to even get an erection with real women because my mind has become so accustomed to the unreal stimulations of porn that sex felt like a huge disappointment. I was diagnosed with erectile dysfunction about a year ago and have been on a nofap routine till now. My current partner has been very supportive and am really glad the abstinence paid off when my willy finally responded while we were making out last weekend. What I want to say is that for men who are currently having problems getting stimulated from your partner, the problem may not be your partner but rather your unrealistic expectations of sex formed from years of porn addiction? I also hope that parents of the newer generation would take the time to educate their young about sex properly instead of treating it as taboo and have their young learn about them through social media or porn which over sexualizes everything.

Day in day out he faces the same few issues of route march, field camps etc that saying ""jiayou you made it proud of you"", just don't seem to cut it. I am the kind of person that hates people telling me all will be fine when it won't but now I am the one saying these words. I feel like my words are very superficial as he's going to go through the same things tomorrow, but I don't know any other ways to make him feel better when he's stuck in camp. I would just like to ask those that been through army, what are words you that bring you comfort when you're upset inside? Any way I can show to him that I'm here for him without sounding so fake?

The problem is, my partners have all been Asian while she's an ex-spg. When she first told me I was the first Asian guy, I felt physically sick and nauseous but kept it to myself and thought could get over it but unfortunately I can't, hence the sexless relationship. It's gotten to a point where I find it physically impossible to get sexually aroused by her and brush her off telling her I'm not in the mood. She hasn't brought it up or been affected by it yet as she's very understanding and thinks I've just been not in the mood. I haven't cheated on her but it's getting really frustrating.

Sometime this year, I realised that the frequency of intimacy has decreased. And when we do, the sex isn’t as mind blowing as before. I do still love my boyfriend in every way and I would never want to “look outside” to satisfy these desires.

However, after seeing my friend go out with her a few times, I decided that I had to act, and went to confess to her directly, and that’s how we got attached. 

Now, me and my gf stopped talking to my friend altogether, and my gf kept assuring me that it was the right thing to do, because she eliminated him fair and square, and I have already fell out with him since.

Just a couple of months ago I've met this guy that I consider a friend to me, and I'm sure it's likewise for him. He's been really nice to me (not sure if I should take those as hints), however, I want to take things a bit further, but I'm really scared right now. Should I take the first initiative or take a step back and see it goes? Any advice from the guys? :(

474,"Hi I need some advice, please help a girl out. Soooo there's this guy who's interested in me and he has asked me out a couple of times. He's a nice guy but I feel no attraction to him whatsoever and I don't want to lead him on, so I've been subtly rejecting him each time (saying I'm busy, keeping text conversations short etc.) I do this because I don't want to hurt his pride (I say pride for the lack of a better term) and I think it truly takes guts to ask someone out, which I admire. But in part it's also because he's my friend's friend and the three of us are in the same class together and we're desk mates and I don't want to make things awkward. That said, he just asked me out again and I'm getting tired of this so should I just make things clear to him once and for all? What is the most diplomatic way to go about doing so? Sigh, is he just that dense or does he not want to get it?

I have been on dates before but they usually end it after the second date and tell me they're not attracted to me because of my height. I take care of myself by going to the gym, maintaining a good GPA, learning the piano, playing sports and already have a job offer before graduating but all my achievements are diminished because of my height. My female friends and relatives have even told me that they wouldn't date someone my height ever.

During my internships in the CBD, I am easily the shortest male, barely at shoulder level of other males. Women without high heels are already taller than me, let alone those who wear them.

478,"After 3.6 years of relationship, I recently broke up with my boyfriend. In the first few years, I was really into him and serious about the relationship. I wanted to marry him after 2 years of dating and hinted to him but he didn’t take any action. I was quite disappointed with him, especially about our financial plan and savings. 

As the years go by, I realised the things we want in life are no longer the same. I love challenges and travel around by myself (because he doesn’t want to join me or not interested) , and he is an idle person, stay at home and like a coach potato, not keen in exploring new stuff. I know something isn’t right in the 3 year of relationship and asked my friends whether is it normal that sometimes I didn’t miss him and forgot to text him when I was traveling. My friends told me it’s normal when you are busy and don’t think too much. I tried to find back the love we had but unable reconnect to him. I just hold on to it....I didn’t realise “it is the time to let go” until I met someone else who is younger and fun who I can connect to. We chat and talked a lot stuff (he flirts with me but I didn’t take it seriously). In a way, the existence of this new guy makes things clearer that I have grown apart from my bf. So I broke up with my boyfriend and I told him I need some time to rethink of this relationship. Breaking apart would make things clearer. After breaking up with him, surprisingly I feel relieved and guilty at the same time. Guilty because I hurt him and wasted his time. He tried to chase me back but i rejected. Things didn’t turn out nicely as he was quite a jerk, took back some expensive stuff he bought for me... Anyway those fancy stuff doesn’t matter to me, so that’s alright.

My friends know him as the “Mr Nice” and my friends think I betrayed him for someone else. Because the existence of this person and I broke up with him? I still feel bad for him and friends think I am a bitch, heartless. There is nothing much I can do, as I can‘t explain and don’t think they would understand. 

I still chat with this fun guy I met. He knows I broke up and decided to chase me. My friends (not-so-close) advised me to find someone who is financially stable - build a family and stop wasting my youth and time on this guy. He is 5 years younger than me but somehow we can connect and I’m genuinely happy when I’m with him. He asked me out for dating and I’m still hesitating. One side of me want to hang out with him, know him better but another side worried that i might hurt him. He might think that he has chance. I worried that if I let this continue and we might not be compatible in the end (maybe because of age gap and financial status) then I will hurt another guy. 

Should I accept him to go dating or look for someone who is stable? I’m very lost, all the time. Am I thinking too much?

Fast forward, in one night we became fwb and every time we saw each other we were suuuuper horny. He did ask me if we could try dating. I said no almost immediately. The ending was so bad, that he rejected me in bed. He said the guilt would eat him alive as he still likes his crush. Wtf reason is that? The rejection in bed killed me. I was so so so so so sad. The most painful thing is, we are in a clique and we have to pretend nothing happened.

Our relationship is not the same anymore, we don't text individually anymore. Even kinda awkward when we are put together alone.

480,"My thoughts on dating apps.
We're at a time where modern dating is complicated. Right now especially, we are objectified by people via social media. We post on instastories because we want people to say what we're doing, we post pictures on instagram, waiting for likes and comments. Deep down we're seeking for external validation. We're in an era whereby we swipe right because this person is good looking. Hopefully has a fun , interesting personality and hope all goes well. We get out, meet this person, have fun and hopefully, we'll be going out on a 2nd date, 3rd date and so on. But in the midst of all these fun conversations, it's become normal to date others. It's normal to say ""hey, I really had a fun time with this person, but let me get more swipes, go out for more dates and see how it goes."" When either party finally expresses interest, the other says ""I'm not too sure. But let's just hang out and see how it goes."" 

But in other words,"" Hey, you're a pretty fun person to hang with, but let me just date more people, if I find a better person, I'll stop dating you."" Isn't it pathetic that we've been objectified by others who we have interest in and vice versa. Since when are we not enough but want more because of the plethora of dishes that is laid in front of us. Why should we be objectified by others. Why should validation be expressed by others, hoping that we're good enough when they're already interested.

Just found out my 1st love had a baby girl and she's turning one soon... so happy for her family :) <3
Sadly, she cut all contact with me. Maybe I was stupid, maybe I was egoistic back then. She confessed to me before leaving for further studies using an alias name, but back then I had no clue and army had made me even more stupid. If only she could know my feelings, that I wish we can still be friends forever.

We broke up because of intense family pressure. Long story short, her parents are not supportive of our relationship and every time she went out with me her parents will give her hell. We thought we could eventually convince her parents but the pressure from them broke us first.

As much as I tried to make her happy everyday I could tell that every time when she is out with me she is thinking about how to handle her parents when she gets home. Even though she is smiling and laughing all the time when she is with me, I can tell that she is not truly happy. Seeing that side of her breaks me and it slowly eats me up from the inside. I felt like the most useless bf ever and bit by bit my self-esteem got chipped away. we broke up because we both knew that it was for the best. She did the extreme and cut off all channels of communications from me. she blocked me on all platforms. She told me that's the only way she can ever get over me.

Standing by the exit of A1E just past 9am this morning, that dark moppy hair only served to further accentuate your smooth, fair skin. I guess you would be what others conventionally call a pretty boy - the only thing that could be fairer than that radiating skin would be the cream white jumper hiding your broad shoulders lean frame, nicely complemented with your dark grey (or olive green? or black?) bermudas that showed off those legs which deserve every attention.

But what was most attractive was the look of brooding - first on A1E, then at The Deck - your lonesomeness only served to make your more endearing. I suppose you are one of those who will always be swarmed by aunties and neighbours with extra snacks and a pinch of your fair cheek.

1. While I was doing my industrial attachment in year 3, I happened to meet a senior who had just graduated and was working at the company for about a year. He’s the kind of guy who has his good looks hidden behind his glasses. He has a calm demeanour and is really nice and friendly. He’s quite buff and strong, and i heard from colleagues that he still goes to nus gym to work out. I didn’t approach him and just treated him as a crush. I regret this so much. I should have approached him but i don’t know how and what to do. We were in different departments so i would occasionally pop by the floor his department is on to look at him. I decided to try to work out at nus gym maybe to see him and strike up a conversation. I went almost daily to try to find him but he only goes on saturdays. Every saturday i will try to find him at the gym but recently his disappeared. and i’m no longer on my IA at the company. here’s my first question: How can i find him again?
2. i usually am quite active on snapchat. the people who add me are close friends and they know about my crush on the senior. One day i went to a department store and saw a girl being quite close to my crush. I don’t know if she’s her girlfriend but my heart was crushed. i knew i stood no chance because he looked very happy and she was quite pretty and tall. i took a photo of them from far to post on snapchat to say that i have officially dropped out of the race to get him. After a few hours i realised the posts on my snapchat were screenshotted several times. i panicked because it was something quite private. and i felt so stupid for putting that online. I found that it was girl A who had screenshot and decided to go on her instagram to see if she posted the screenshot on instastory. long story short, i found out through some stalking that girl A was actually a close friend of my crush’s girlfriend.

Then, he started texting me because he wanted to ask me something about what we just discussed. Our texting continued for  4 days talking about random things and he also asked me what I usually do and stuff, just simple messages you will send to your friend. But he did say things like he was thinking about me etc, but I just replied with a HAHA because I did not know if he was joking or being serious. Also, time was a factor as I felt that it was weird a guy would say such things when we only knew each other for 5 days. I took him as a friend and found no harm sharing, and asked him how his weekend went and stuff. Then, on fifth day of knowing him, we left the event location together when the event ended. Then I realised that while talking, he kept standing very close to me and tugged at my hand in the process. I felt that he's trying to have some physical contact with me and did feel a bit happy, but I didnt shoo away from him. I am not sure if he is using that to try to test if I am interested in him? Then, after that day, he stopped texting me and when we met again during follow up event, he did not talk much to me and did not leave the event location with me anymore. I could feel the change in him, but what I am vexed about is why that sudden change? The change was really huge and sudden that I can’t even find any reason for it. Looking back, did I do something that irritated him after that day of physical encounter? I don’t think I did because it was within such a short period of time. Or is it that he is just trying to find physical comfort in someone? Anyways, I realised his horoscope is Aries and not sure if this is how Aries guys act around girls.

Unfortunately, I was young, naive and didn't really think through my actions. Also, Atticus was a teacher in my school, so it was logistically difficult to meet. Eventually, the pressures of having a secret relationship stressed me out too much, so I decided to break up with Atticus. 

Since then,  I have gone out with various guys: some casual flings, some serious relationships, some FWB arrangements. Some of the guys that I have dated include a famous-ish youtube celebrity and the son of one of the crazy rich families in Singapore. Surprisingly, even though many of the guys that I dated have better stats than Atticus, none of these relationships ever lasted for more than a few months. I just never felt anything for any of these guys. 

It took me way too long to figure this out for myself, but now that I have, I am completely sure of this: Atticus is the guy for me. I was foolish to break up with Atticus. After all, we lasted well into my fourth year, which is way past the halfway point of IP.  I should have endured just two more years. I should have given our love a chance. True love conquers all, but I was not brave enough so I threw it all away. As things currently stand, it is difficult for me to get back together with Atticus, but it is also difficult for me to find happiness with any other guy. In theory, since I am now certain that I love Atticus, my mind tells me that I should try my best to get back together with him. Unfortunately, my heart is too cowardly to make the first move. I guess this is the story of my life: because I am stupid and scared, I am fated to continue one meaningless  relationship after another until I eventually die alone.

My ex-boyfriend and I parted ways exactly 2 years ago while he was on an exchange. It was that one fine day when he decided that our lives had turned boring and he doesn't sees a future in us anymore. Prior to that, we were together for going 7 years. As much as I wanted and tried to hold him back, knowing him, and wanting the best for him, if that was what his heart wished for, I'd let go because I want him to be happy and I believe that love come in many ways. 

The immediate 1 year after the break-up was a lonely and self-recovery journey that I was forced to undertake. Earlier this year, it has come to my realisation that I've put everything behind me, even though I'd still think of him from time to time and have been constantly reflecting on what I could have done better for my next relationship. As I'm introverted and do not meet new people in my daily activities (I'm already in the working society), I've turned to cmb, hoping to find that someone.

Throughout the past 1 year, I've met a few and have ghosted a few (I'm really sorry), it became more apparent as times go by, as to what kind of guy I'm looking for and want to spend my time with. However, I'm still single today and am still in the search for that 'perfect' guy even though I know nobody is perfect. Honestly there are a lot of desperate guys out there, if I have wanted, I'd be attached right now. However, I don't want to get into a relationship just for the sake of being in a relationship. I hope the wait is worth it and I hope the guy I'm waiting for comes soon :(

Have recently met this guy (from the app) which my heart pounded a little for, even though I've never met him in person for interactions yet (actually not entirely true because we both recognised each other at the start of the convo as we were in one of the same tutorial classes back then when studying in uni). However I felt that he doesn't feel the same for me. He'd normally replies after a few hours (eg. at least 4 hours after my last reply), even though it was a lengthy one (like what they say, sometimes hot, sometimes cold). Based on my experience of such convo, I know that he will one day stop replying soon. That brings me back to my starter question, do you believe that I should resign to fate?

508,"To OP #70401:

I was in the same boat as you a few years ago and ended up initiating a breakup with my then bf. Perhaps our circumstances might not be exactly the same, but let me just share some thoughts based on my experience.

Texting other girls might seem harmless, perhaps they are really just friends, but do look at the bigger picture as well. Has he been giving you the same amount of time and attention as those girls? For instance, my ex used to claim that he’s perpetually busy at work, and that he’s no big texter. He hardly texted me, so I felt really cheated when I found out that he has been engaging in a lot of casual  text conversations with other girls.

Perhaps he is not telling the truth about them just being friends, who knows maybe they knew each other from dating apps, which are so easily accessible nowadays? Especially since you mentioned he has new girls to talk to every now and then. Very suspicious, how is it possible that he can make so many new friends (and all girls) within a short period of time? Since he said they are “friends”, maybe you can try asking him how he got to know those “friends”, then observe his reactions. You can even jokingly ask him to introduce you to them one day. If he sounds hesitant, turns defensive or blame you for having trust issues, most likely something is going on. At this point, if your insecurity bothers you so much, and if he’s not cutting down on those texting habits despite knowing that you feel uncomfortable, I suggest you just leave already. If you choose to stay, just pray hard that you will somehow find out the truth (if any) before it’s too late. In my case, one fine day my friend saw my ex bf’s profile on a dating app, alerted me, purposely initiated conversations with him and asked him out to test his reactions, and the rest was history....

I think the biggest red flag is that he hit on other girls while giving the impression that he is single. Once you know of this, it actually no longer matters that he claims that he is serious with you, having introduced you to his parents etc., because hey, his behaviour totally shows otherwise! Please don’t just accept his words of reassurance blindly. In my case, we’re already discussing marriage and I was just waiting for him to propose. When I caught him cheating and confronted him, he told me it was because actually he still wanted to explore and not ready to settle down! Well, why would your bf market himself out there as single if he’s ready to commit to you and only you? Seems like he wants the comfort of having someone to always fall back on, while at the same time still wanting to fool around and perhaps looking for better options out there. Please don’t waste your time and youth on him, there are still a lot of guys out there who are more deserving of your love and care and will treat you as priority and not a spare. You might be tempted to stay in this relationship due to the fear of being alone etc, but once you let go, it actually feels very liberating. Been there done that, and eventually met someone who is better in every way, able to address my insecurities and never leaves me wondering whether he truly loves me. 

Apologies for the long post, I wish you all the best in making up your mind and hope you will eventually find your happiness.

I am not the prettiest girl but don't think I am particularly unattractive either (I do dress up and put makeup when I go to class). I'm not usually bothered by my singleness because I do enjoy it but sometimes I do wonder if there's something wrong with me because I've literally got no romance going on in my life (all the people I text frequently are my girl friends I don't even have many close guy friends).

Many arguments happened between us and at the start of this year, she asked for a breakup and i begged her to stay even though in between the rs, many ppl including my parents and disapprove our relationship simply because of mainly personality. We “got back tgt” but she lied behind me regarding her using tinder even though i showed her clear evidence that she did. Call me paranoid but i just wanted to find out the truth. In the end, we called it a day one month later. A few weeks after that, i used my workplace’s duty phone to text her pretending to be my friend demanding for my jacket, which she claimed that she alr posted it to my house. From then till now, which is about 8 months alr, i still havent got it back so pretty sure she still keeps it. I wonder why she still has my jacket even though after me, she dated 2 other guys and now she’s alr in a rs. Im afraid of what she will do to the jacket. Is she holding on to the hope that we will get back tgt? If so, no way will that happen. She ruined my life. But why would she keep my jacket nevertheless?

Same! Convos between me and my crush are mostly academics stuff... I usually want to try to keep the convo going but as she is from a different clique as mine, I'm not exactly sure what she likes to talk about, so it's hard. Partly also because when she asks questions, I assume that she's studying so I don't really want to disturb her too much with my replies (especially that it's recess week now)

Might be similar for your case (although the roles are swapped). I think it's possible to tell from his replies if he finds it annoying. Maybe initiate a non-academic convo if you know what topic you both have in common. It might just be that he doesn't now what else you want to talk about and can't get the hint.

517,"Thinking of having children but just can’t trust your man that he won’t meander into another woman’s arms? Here is a practical advice that would pretty much gurantee he won’t deviate cos he risk losing too much. The more he is experienced, the more he will be afraid to lose you. 

If you like a man and you don’t want to lose him, hold on to him using your third hand. For life. 

Pre or post marriage whatever. The cert should hardly matter to you if you find the right man. The strength of your relationship will be determined by your ability to grab and hold him with your third hand.

Forget abt all the preaching of “holy” people who talk so much but in the end are hypocrites with secret affairs behind their “holy” significant other. Nah, I already have it distilled down to a science while people still think sustaining marriage is some kinda wishy washy hoping with faith. 

Guys are like kids that needs to be held by the third hand all the time so that they don’t lose their way. 

Also forget about all the crazy techniques in bed you saw as video and all the nonsense you ever saw or read and thought, ‘that would please a man in bed’. Those are like hollywood action shows, it would be a painstaking effort with little return. 

The only technique in bed that u shd be concerned abt is tightness. You are on the right track when it becomes clear that he would sell his soul to live another day with you on earth. Doesn’t matter how experienced he is before he met you.

Jade pigeon eggs. 

Your ancestors can thank me later. I need all the positive karma I can get to meet my wife the next life too. 

-from a guy happily married to a wife for ten years with a kid and have literally zero interest in any other woman. All that confidence. All freaking plastic bags. 

P.s.- YMMV, since attitude in life and character must match first or his life will be a perma BDSM of “hate her mind but love her body too much to leave”

518,"“I was like an ‘incel’ kid.  I’d never had a girlfriend.  I’d only had sex with prostitutes.  I was very suicidal.  Then one day I was standing next to a cute girl at a bus stop, and I googled: ‘How to approach women.’  

That’s when I came across a forum for pick-up artists.  It’s exactly what I’d been looking for.  It seemed like a cure for my autism.  I watched all the videos I could find.  I started working out at a gym.  I’d spend all day approaching women.  Soon I was only hanging out with other pick-up artists.  They respected me.  They wanted to learn from me.  Finally there was something I was good at.  

Right now I have over one thousand numbers in my phone and had sex with 20+ woman.  It’s a bit like gambling.  Sometimes it goes well.  Sometimes it doesn’t.  But you always have the chance for sex.  There are so many tricks to learn.  

Women have emotional brains.  They get addicted to feelings.  You can use that to your advantage.  The first time you meet her—tell her she looks amazing.  But never give her a full compliment again.  She’ll always chase that validation.  It’s like a drug.  Tell her ‘she looks beautiful for her age.’  Tell her ‘she looks good in this lighting.’  Keep her insecure with half compliments.  Keep her feeling like there’s something wrong with her.  Like she’s not good enough for you.  Like she needs sex for validation.  

Of course it’s manipulation, but why should I care?  I’ve been manipulated so many times in my life (bankers, sales, MLM, corporate boss etc).

Everything was perfect at the peak of our friendship. We stayed up texting through the night sharing our deepest secrets and spending our day in school like two peas in the same pod. We did literally everything together, we were like a couple but better - We were besties. 

However, things started to fall apart after our finals. You formed a new clique, I felt insecure and jealousy grew. Was I too boring? Did I do something wrong? Fast forward to this week you refuse to even go out with me alone. I then understood everything when I looked at your new clique. You found the bestfriend you wanted, a girl. The only issue you had with me was that I'm a guy and you're a girl. No matter how hard I try, no matter what I do, I will never be able to match up to that new bestfriend you found simply for the fact that we're of a different gender. 

To my Ex-Bestfriend Lynn, it's simply too tiring for me to try anymore. It's becoming unhealthy for me to constantly have you on my mind. I fought hard with you and for you but sadly I have lost the battle. I'm sorry for being a difficult guy to deal with and I thank you for all the time you spent with me. For now I will go back to being that nerdy virgin who will be forever alone. Waifu for laifu I guess. 

I love you bestie, take care, farewell.

Back then, I used to hang out with this pretty attractive girl. Different girl from my previous post. Slender body, nice smile, and fair skin. We’ll head out to movies and dinners. Frequently in movies, she will ask me if I’m naughty or not. She likes to place my hands on her thigh, inching closer by the minutes, when it’s not even a horror movie. Thereafter we went to take a stroll, she pointed to me an inexpensive hotel, asked if I would like to spend a couple of hours there. She wants to do ‘it’ with me. I looked at her in amazement, in disbelief that this very day arrived, not on a stormy night wherein the movies, people seek shelter but a freaking random weekend. I joked that there isn’t a 7-eleven nearby, so it’s not going to happen. But in fact, I already spotted one while we were strolling. I can sense her disappointment, her urge, that she can conquer the night, she was more prepared and mentally ready than me getting pumped up for a 24km march. You tried being pro-active, hinting me with your scantily clad attire, of how beautiful your legs and body were. It’s not that you’re not pretty, or not attracted to what you have to offer but it’s just that my ‘Guild’ needs me. Still, I’m sorry…glad that you found someone you love now

We hit off quite well in no time, since we share similar hobbies and similar tastes in japanese things. We also spent a lot of time having deep conversations and met up regularly to eat. Surprisingly, he agreed with me on a lot of topics I thought was controversial and not many would agree with. In no time, we became best friends and whenever there is a jio we will only go if  both of us are going. 

The next thing I knew, he got attached, I wanted to be happy for him and I congratulated him but i was quite upset and  angry that i wasnt the first to know about it. He didnt even tell me anything about girls or that he had someone he liked. Because of this I gave him the cold shoulder. Not like he actually cared, since he has a gf now. But barely a few days in, I kinda missed his presence and how we used to share with each other our deepest secrets. Seeing him and his gf flirting around so much also made me really uncomfortable. 

Anyway, I made some other friends and this girl N showed me some BL manga. At first i was quite shocked at the contents, is this how hardcore bl is supposed to be? But i found myself enjoying the manga and even asked for more recommendations. And when i met J again, i couldnt help but visualise him and me together. I think im gay for him. But he is a hetero and i dont think its going to work out since he has a gf. So i gave up on him. 

But now, he broke up with his gf a month ago and came back to me for company and we started talking alot again. I told myself that I need to stop this toxic r/s cos my feelings are growing even more as i spend time with him. But I cant help it whenever our hands touch or he pats my head when I got a A for my essay.

I've just graduated last year and found a job related to my degree, receiving a salary of 4.1k, which is the average salary of people with my degree.

So, my fiancee and I have BTOed, currently waiting for our flat and our wedding ceremony will be held a year later, after she graduates from uni. Since I came from a much humbled background as compared to her, my family and I would usually take the public transport, or at most grab/rent a car on rare ocassions. Since I'm currently working with a decent salary, I've decided to purchase a car so that it would be much convenient for everyone and I can bring her out on dates more often too. However, when I told her about this plan, she doesn't seem to understand things from my POV. She mentioned that we will be spending lots of money on our new flat, wedding dinner, honeymoon, my tuition loans etc and the car would be a financial burden. Basically she hates the idea of me owning a car, despite giving in to her by choosing a cheaper car. She mentioned that owning a car in SG is equivalent to burning money away since it's COE only lasts for 10 years, hence the depreciation.

Okay, so everytime we get into this topic, she just doesn't seem to give in and we have been in this conflict for about 2 weeks. And I'm honestly so fed up. She knows that I love cars since young and owning one is my lifetime dream. I'm super lost right now, how should i convince her to let me own one?

She became cold towards me lately, even coaxing her with food doesn't help like how it does in the past. Although she doesn't ignore me, I can tell that she is very unhappy by her attitude through the phone or irl. I did not expect her to react in such a way since she grew up from a rather wealthy background and travelling by cars were her go to. But she mentioned that she didn't want her parents to support her after we get married. I really don't like to see her being unhappy, but I really want to own one car.

We still keep in contact after my internship and we went out together as friends recently. I wanted to make the move to ask him out but he told me he is not ready for a relationship. Now I'm not sure if he is just replying my texts to entertain me or to keep the conversation going. Well since he is not ready to be in a relationship, I can only keep him as a friend.

549,"Hello, 

I’m in NUS year 1 right now. 

However I’ve been feeling down lately for quite a while. My Girlfriend broke up with me almost two years ago and we were together for 4 years. 

I’ve been going out on dates for a year post breakup but it’s not helping.  Most of the time there will not be a second date afterwards. It’s difficult to initiate a second meetup when the girl I’m out with doesn’t seem like she’s better than my ex.. 

It’s been almost a year since I last went on a date, I don’t think I’m bad looking.. I’ve not been able to bring myself to kissing another girl/sleeping w them. 

Deep down I still love her but she’s not ready for any relationship ( I’m not sure if she meant it ) at this moment, I’m diverting my attention on work and studies.

It’s really tough, it’s taking a toll on me. I’ve to agree that I’ve crushes here and there and it will probably help me move on if I’m able to date them but I do not have the courage to try - I fear rejections and I know for a fact that I shouldn’t rely on flings as distractions.

But whatever it is, I still love my ex and if I could I would still date her and accept her for who she is. 

Please advise me on what I should do. My savings are not that high hence I’m unwilling to  go out on dates with other girls unless she’s my ex, because she’s the only girl I’m willing to spend whatever cash I have to see the smile on her face

Thank you for hearing me out, apologies if the sentence structure isn’t up to standard. I just poured whatever was on my mind

Lastly I believe I’ve changed for the better. I’ve been more understanding, open minded and loving.

So, my best friend is interested in this one guy thus she invited him to hang out with our clique and he kind of clicked with everyone so he's now part of our clique. As time passes by, I'm starting to develop feelings for him as well as he is really a fun and interesting guy, he's smart and he takes very good care of people in general and he has a good sense of humor too. Sometimes when I think about it, I think I'd make a greater pair together with him comparing to my best friend but I don't know if I should confess my feelings to him because I have known my best friend for a really long time and I don't want to lose my best friend. The thing is, even though my best friend has been clear that she really likes that guy (to us only), but she has never confessed to him or told him anything about it which means the guy is still available right? I'm pretty sure if i confess and end up together with the guy, my best friend will hate me for life but I really like him as well, what should I do? 

Tldr; I like the same guy as my best friend and she has no idea, I don't know if I should confess because I don't wanna lose my best friend, but I really like the guy too.

Just a few months back when I was given a new project, there was this drop-dead gorgeous guy who came into our office for a meeting. He looked so handsome I was swooning as I made him a coffee. Our meeting turned to lunch and when we finished up I told him, “Ring me any time if I can help you with anything.”

One night he called to ask me something trivial but then he said, “Look, I’m sorry to call you so late but in all honesty, I couldn’t stop thinking about you.”
I cut the call short as my boyfriend was at home with me but the next morning I called him and we arranged to have lunch in a hotel.

We ended up having sex in a hotel room after lunch and the it was so amazing! 
His body was ripped and he really appreciated what I had to offer.
We’ve been meeting up for sex for months now and we even did it in the back of his car before. 

It was just great chemistry at first but now I have feelings for him. I feel guilty and don’t know what to do. Any advice?

556,"I've been together with him for almost 5 years. As much as I love him, I can't get rid of my insecurities that derived from his past wrongdoings. On good days, we are a loving couple. I choose to see only the good side of him, and he treats me well too. On bad days when I start to suspect he is going back to do things that would hurt me. I get paranoid, because it is not a one-off incident. Over the years, I've tried my best to trust him. But whenever I have flashback of what he did to me, I would question his actions, check on him and his phone - not because I want to pick on him, but I just didn't want what I fear most to happen. To me what he did has cheated on me emotionally and I just needed that assurance that it won’t happen again, ever. He doesn’t quite get it - he thinks I'm doing all these to picked on him. He said he has changed for the better. There were instances that I believe he did. But recently, I caught him doing something of that similar nature, which I can’t accept. The intentions, to me, were clear, and still the same. He claimed that there’s nothing bad or wrong. I disagree, because what he is doing it still fundamentally threatens the stability our r/s, and it breaks the trust I have for him or whatever that is left.

Instead of feeling remorseful for hurting me, he just decided that I should accept him for who he is, what he is doing, otherwise I should just leave. I felt that he just wouldn't give in anymore. And I can’t blame him fully for that. Because whenever I found out that he did something, I get more paranoid, and question him, even more. Our quarrels become more frequent, intolerable. I can’t sleep because I would have anxiety when the thoughts of him doing all those things behind my back comes flooding my mind. I tried hard to accommodate. But because the pain and hurt is still so fresh, and because I still have anxiety and panic attacks about the past incidents - I would become very very unloving and undesirable. He says he couldn’t smile at me or be happy to see me anymore. But he could, to others. No doubt he is still treating me relatively well when we are not quarrelling. But the way he sees me has changed. The way he thinks about me has changed. He sees me as someone that is unreasonable, pushy, overly demanding for him to change and every now and then I attempt to find fault with him and quarrel. But that’s not my intention. And I never want to quarrel with him. 

I try to find even more ways to prove to myself that he loves me, to make up to the part where I felt that he doesn’t. So whenever he’s with me, he’s nice to me – I’m okay. Cause I stop thinking. But when I realized he treat others somewhat better, or when he is not around with me, I will start to think otherwise. Cause I’m hurt from what he had done, I reacted because I needed time to heal. For hurting me, can’t he be more understanding? Why can’t he understand the pain he brought to me and the harm to the r/s for doing so. He said he is tired too. Tired of trying when he knows he can’t agree with me. And when these are the answers I get from him - I get more agitated, more upset. 

At this point, he would break it. He would get really pissed, at why am I always trying to find fault in him, and he would get really mad at me. He thinks I’m finding trouble with him, esp when he is tired from work. He would then block me off and get angry for days. Leaving me sleepless, paranoid and even more hurt. Even when I tried to talk it out nicely to him about my concerns – he would think that all these talks are useless.  It’s either I accept it, or I leave. 

Past few weeks was like hell. I felt the need to confront him about the matter that he was doing. I plead him to change because if he don’t, we can't move on. And I can’t sleep. I plead him not to do it, not to hurt me, but he can’t fulfil that promise. He doesn’t agree because he don’t see any wrong in it. I needed so much assurance. At the same time, because I decided to put faith in us and that he would eventually understand my pov, so I would raise this matter to him again and again, but every time – I get the same outcome- unhappiness, unsatisfied, unsettled. And he thinks I’m just looking to quarrel with him, not giving him any breaks week after week.

No longer does he want to be in this r/s, nor to change for us. But to me, even at the breaking point, even when I think that breaking up would be the better option since he couldn’t understand - I still decided that I don’t want to leave. Even when he doesn’t want this r/s anymore. Even when we can’t see where this is going. 

He says I’m selfish, selfish that I just keep wanting him to change. Is that really true? The change isn’t just a change in a bad temper – but an action that is fundamentally wrong to be done by someone who is in a r/s, who should stay committed and responsible. If this continues, I can’t stop being paranoid. I can’t trust him again and again if he chooses to stay like this. How to trust when whenever I trust him, but when I do check upon him – I get to see what I don’t want to see the most? It hurts, I feel that I’m torn apart. I can accept it as his past, but I can’t accept him not willing to change. Not because he sees it wrong or what, but it is affecting us. If he really wants the r/s, wouldn’t he put in effort too? He said he is tired of putting in effort when I can’t just give him some peace. But how to stop thinking when it’s not stopping.
Now, since he doesn’t want to change or hang onto this r/s, it’s just me – ultimately, whether I can accept his actions, and let it be there without ever turning to him and ask him to change. What should I do? I can't let go of a love that I hold so dear. I'm tired too. I'm not asking him to change completely, I just wish that he If he would compromise and try, I would try my best not to act up too. I really am trying but he can’t see it. And because it is true, we have been quarrelling nonstop in the past few weeks. What can I do if I want to keep this r/s? No trolls please.

561,"Hi all,

I've been in an LDR since June. My boyfriend and I had been together for only 2 months before he left for further studies in the US. While we were both in Singapore, he was extremely attentive and we talked everyday, even if it was just to chat about each other's day.

After he left, however, he became a lot less attentive. He would reply whenever I texted him, but he never initiated any conversation with me - I always had to take the first step. Also, we have Facetimed only once in the months that he has been away.

I understand that he is very busy in his course and the time difference is a huge obstacle, so I'm not sure if I'm asking too much. 

Given that ours is a young relationship, I'm not sure if it's reasonable for me to be so insecure. I suppose the fact that he's older than me (he's in his mid-30s) means that he's a lot more secure in his needs and wants, and maybe he's just not the type who needs that much interaction with his significant other. 

 I don't want to come off as immature and clingy, but a small part of me is also starting to think that I deserve the best (we all do!) and maybe it's not him.

Dunker is short guy who openly confessed to his love to his 7 years tall girl Friend. Finding ways to impress her and wanna be her bf. In my situation, although I am 181 tall guy and her height is about my shoulder length tall. But inside my heart, I felt so small and soft like dunkers in the movie. Cos she is always in the upper hand. She always told me we only can be friend and nothing else. I am happy to be her Friend rather than nobody. I spend lot of times and effort trying to win your heart. But all I get was a rejection. I know it is dumb and silly to do anything for her. But all I wanted is to make her happy. She is in a terrible situation and need to make big decisions in her life. The only thing I can offer is giving her more trouble and adding in more problem in the situation. I remember She once push me away, when I finally decided to set her free, she ask me back to her life. I was Glad and happy then but now I am confused. I always thought after she having a Long and hard day at school she will need someone like me to brighten her day a little. But I just not the right person and I think appear way too many times in her life. Start making her feel uncomfortable. But What I wanna her to know is I make time for her. Sometimes, I even make up stupid reason just to let her feel less awkward. In the movie, Dunkers know and  understand every little things about Jodi ( tall girl in the movie). E.g. her favourite Color, eye Color and etc. For me, to my knowledge maybe I know her at least 70-80%. There are a few Movie scenes really touches my heart. Showing unconditional love and care to her like the friends, family Jodi has. Note to her, No matter how dark and deep you are facing now I hope I can be the pulling you out. I might be the wrong guy at the wrong timing. But trust me, I won’t be the 1st to leave you till you are safe. Text me if you need me to be around.

So it was the first lecture of a particular module today and the lecturer was very engaging. She made us form into groups of 5/6s today to introduce ourselves to one another and since another guy and I were sitting at the far end of the table, we only form a group of 2, me and him. It was a little awkward as usual, as all of us were strangers. So he started the convo by introducing himself and I carried on.

After a short introduction, the lecturer started teaching and gave us some time to discuss certain questions after that. But girls beside me already form their own group since the ice breaker, so it's once again the guy and I. I was sort of awkward so I didn't look at his direction, avoiding all eye contact and any chance to discuss the question. So both of us just waited for the lecturer to continue. The second time this happened, he went out to get some food so once again, we didn't discuss.

After I reach home, I felt like I probably like him (ish). Maybe a crush? Or an eyecandy? So I started regretting how I avoided all the discussion opportunities.

So this woman here, is determined to reach the LT early next friday and strike a casual convo with him since i found out we had similar courses, which i forgot to ask which other mods he was taking. How dumb of me. Anyways, I just want to know if that guy would be freaked out by me. I'm just afraid he thinks I'm a weirdo who sorta ignored him the previous week but strike up a convo the following week.

P.s I'm only gonna do this if he is early for lectures because he was damn freaking early today. Im guessing he had a lesson way before the lecture we had. And if it goes well, I'll probably ask if he wants a study buddy for that module and the same module we failed last year. 

P.s.s yes, I'm an evergreen of 21 years and I'm sick of it. I want to change my fate this time round. How does my plan sounds guys?? Can give me some additional advice or encouragement. I scared i will chicken out eh how?? :'(

576,"This is a long post. My bf and I (both 21) have been together for 2 years. He’s midway serving NS while I’m working full time. 

I feel that my bf is being complacent in our rs. E.g. I’m always the one putting effort to make him happy and he doesn’t. He didn’t use to be like this.

I would understand if he’s busy with NS commitments and I thought that NS is a full-on tough 2 years. However, it isn’t much for him. He’s been very free in recent months and tells me he spends most of his day playing games and being on his phone. Isn’t it ironic: when he was busier during BMT and etc. he put in so much more care and effort towards me like texting me as much as he can and going out on dates. Now that he’s free, he doesn’t even drop me a text until to say goodnight. He’s not just free in terms of time, mind you, he can even leave his camp in civil clothes for lunch/dinner everyday which means he can go anywhere to waste some hours away in the day. I’m always wondering what he’s really doing with all his free time instead of giving me just a little bit of it. Is there someone else or he simply doesn’t care about me anymore? 

Not counting the times we go out to have meals because human beings need to eat, it’s been months since we went out. Every weekend is the same routine: I go to his home and Netflix, have sex and actual chill. Sometimes no Netflix even, just sex and chill. Am I just a bootycall or what? 

The only love I feel from him is all the sweet words he says like ily, I can’t live without you, I wanna marry you.... you get the drift. I give him everything he wants and my duty as a gf, time, intimacy, reassurance and occasional gifts and help whenever he needs anything. I’ve even jeopardised some important things to me just to make him happy but I won’t dwell into that.

I’m so envious of my friends and co-workers who are in rs and the gfs are being treated so well. I told a few close friends of mine and they react to my story with a look of pity. I’m not demanding to be treated like a princess, I just want to be treated decently like a gf. There are guys in my workplace expressing their interest in me and treating me better than my bf, but I love my bf and and I don’t want to give up on our rs. 

I wish he can reflect on our rs and change. This is a basic bf duty and I don’t think I should tell him step by step how to be a decent bf. Haiz... NSF guys, please don’t be like this to your GFs... We are the ones on the losing end if you waste our 2 years waiting for you just to be treated like this...

If you read this far, any opinion/advice would be greatly appreciated.

Btw if you follow NUSWhispers posts, I’m Carol mentioned in a post before. 

TLDR; I feel my boyfriend is taking me for granted. I give him everything he wants, he doesn’t put in effort like I do, and he makes me feel like I’m just FWB to him rather than a GF.

This is probably the first time she had her birthday overseas . 18th of June. Her fb didn’t have any birthday celebration or ppl wished about her. Kind of pretty sad actually 

Funny. I never took a liking of other girls except her. Cute, adorable, probably miss all those but anyway, I can still go Thailand to find her . Whether 2 years down the road she wanted to marry me, it really doesn’t matters now. Just hoped she lives well . To me, that’s my greatest happiness

Am I sick in the mind? I can't control it. I can't even hold hands with her in public without people noticing my bulge. She thought it's funny until the day I couldn't control my excitement during dinner with her parents. Well,  I tried my best to hide my boner when taking a family picture.

584,"Has anyone here experienced retrospective jealousy before?
My bf and I are in our late 20s and just got together a few months ago. Since then, to be very honest, I’ve been having difficulties getting over his past relationships and sexual history. He’s more experienced in this aspect than me, having had 4 ex gfs and a number of one night stands previously, as compared to me having only 2 serious relationships before I met him (and never been on casual relationships / one night stands before). Sometimes the thought of him doing romantic and intimate stuff with his exes randomly cross my mind and make me feel uneasy. Even when we’re going about our daily lives, I’m sometimes bothered by such thoughts e.g.while having nice dinner out, I’ll wonder if he has taken his exes to the same place that we are eating. Same goes when we are trying new activities together or travelling. I even went to the extent of stalking his exes on social media and felt even worse after seeing that some of them are relatively good looking, and some still keep their couple photos with my bf.
I haven’t voiced out this issue to my bf as I’m scared it might cause unnecessary arguments that jeopardise our new relationship. Moreover, I also feel bad for opening up to him, as he has been really nice and loving to me so far, always around when I need him, always reassuring me that he loves me a lot and that he is very thankful to have found me. 
I know this is unhealthy and I really hate myself for feeling this way but I’m clueless as to what I can do to get over this jealousy / insecurity. Please help me, I’ll really appreciate it.

591,"Hello there. 

I have been following this page for a while now and realised there are quite a few posts about people saying they are unable to find love. They sound like not finding love makes them the beta human. I would like to say that I was and still am a beta person according to their criteria. But let me give you ""beta"" people an advice. You must have a goal and a burning passion for something in life. Let me tell you that once you have found this goal, you won't have time to worry about not getting a gf/bf cause you will have a bigger goal now. I excel in my passion and im one of the best in my country. People ask for my autograph when they see me in conventions. (It's a gaming hobby that i picked up 7 years ago). People might say ""oh you are the best cause you are smart"". I'm not even smart, my CGPA is only 2.4 and I am slow in learning. but what made me achieve my goals is my passion and the attitude to never give up rather than me being born smart. You have to put your goal above everything else except family. I hope the ""beta"" people here takes my advice and try to work on finding a goal and purpose. It really will change your life and the way you look at things. 

Yeah sex is cool and all but have you ever tried achieving your goals and have people you don't know want your autograph?

One day there was this online gathering, and I decided to attend since I have many online friends there and thought it would help me get through life a bit. From there, I met this girl. It wasn’t love at first sight, heck I was even trying to stop myself from falling in love with her since you know, suicide and also I was never in a relationship. But we bonded so well, she knew all of my secrets, even those i never told my 2 closest friends. She helped me through my depression. Gave me support, hang out with me. Said thingd like “I love you” but as a friend. holding hands, kisses on the cheek. Those 3 weeks was the most happy I have been in my entire life. She gave me a reason to live. She made me want to live. 

However, in later time I realised, she suck at love. Cause a few weeks after that initial “Happiest time of my life”, she started saying she have feelings for another man. Which I can’t do anything about since we were never officially together. All I can do is wish her a happy life. But we promised to stay as best friends. However, slowly be depression started to deteriorate again, which officially ended relationship with 3 of my best friends. Those 2mentioned prior and the girl i was in love with. So I shut myself off from life for a period of a month or so. Come back to found out she found another boyfriend. Then i realised, she suck at love she cant stay commited to a single person. Because of that, many of her victims suffered. 

Im not going to lie, I still have feelings for her since she made me felt love i never had before. But is she really worth it? Cause i bet if im there for her when she breaks up she will just play with me once again.

I've known this guy for a year plus and we met in school. I find him cute and I was interested in him when I first knew him. But he just wants to bang me, like literally. He has been asking me to be his fwb for a year. 
I've always been rejecting him even tho I'm actually attracted to him both physically and sexually. He's soft spoken and has a super sweet smile. He doesn't mind doing boyfriend stuffs for me such as carrying my bags, lending me his jacket, sending me off to the busstop and stuff like that since we hang out often. It's cute but I know the motive behind all these things so I don't really have strong emotions about this.
Until that night, I got super drunk and spent the night with him. To be honest, his performance was meh even though I understand he was the one doing all the actions plus it was an unexpected situation so maybe he got too excited? Anyway, this is not the point. Even though his performance was average, he cuddled with me the whole night, sent me home the next day and acts normal as how we usually act as friends.
Here's the question. Should I continue doing this or just let it be as a one time thingy? Tbh, I don't wanna turn myself into  into a girl who has fwbs even tho there's nth wrong with being one. At the same time, I admit I'm attracted to him. And since I had bad experiences with relationships, so I've staying single for a while, I feel like I kinda need this pleasure too. So how ah?

604,"Hi. You are one of the few friend I truly want to keep. 

But there is something I really really truly need to know. Was there ever a time when you had something for me? The answer to your question was yes, every single you is you. You were the only one on my mind when I wrote it. I wanted to say yes. But there're other sides of me that you don't know about.

You are still the only person that I am truly comfortable being around. By the only person, I mean truly the one and only person. Not even my family gives me the level of ease I have around you. You're the only person to had seen that many sides of me. There's one and last side of me you've yet to fully see. The side which scares even myself. A monster eating away me from the inside. How could I bring you into all of this?

Have you ever discover something so precious to you that you'd do anything to preserve it? Keep it in the current state. Not looking for more. Fear of ending up with less. Knowing and unwilling to take the next step to pull you into my misery you know nothing of. The craziest irony is that you may the one and only to unlock whatever's drowning me. As I walk in the dark, I will not grab the hand coming from the light fearing that I'll drag you into my side instead. I'll sink in comfort knowing you've once extended your hand towards me.

How have you been? Did he hurt you? How I wish I can be the hands to pick you up when you are feeling down. I may not be the one holding your hands, bringing you to places you want to be. But I'm happy being in your shadow, ready to catch you if you ever find yourself slipping back. My hands are on your back supporting you, pushing you towards something better than me.

Will I someday reach your side to be the one to hold your hand into the future? A part of me is screaming 'yes', while another part of me drags me back convincing myself that I'm in too deep. Too deep to recover, I will only stain and affect everybody else's mind when I choose to enter them.

Back to you. Yes you, if I could choose it will be you. I shouldn't have lied that day. I shouldn't have let you walked away. If only I grabbed you, held you instead of letting you go, pushing you away. I love your 'crazy', it doesn't annoy me. I love your character, you have an opinion, you get it heard. I love your independence, you know what you want, you get it done. I love your love for your life, you get yourself out there, get to places you want to be it by yourself or with others. My days are getting darker by the day. The lesser I want to taint your life.

The more I think about you. The more I'm ready to go. Not everything comes twice in life. I believe I've found the perfect fit in you for me and I'm unable to grab onto you. I don't foresee it getting any better in the coming days. I don't foresee anybody else who can convince me out of this place ever. It was great while it lasted. Every memory of you will be buried deep in me and cherished forever.

I'm currently in a LDR. I'm so stressed because my boyfriend is a foreigner and I am trying to find ways to live and work in his country. But due to Visa difficulties (extremely difficult to obtain a visa as a fresh grad), I will most likely work in Singapore after I grad.

He has thought of coming over but it is equally as hard or even more difficult. He has a relatively above average pay from working and coming to Singapore with not so stellar CV will probably mean he may not be able to get the same level of pay. Plus given the high living cost here and the foreigner tax he has to pay, it is an option that is not preferred atm.

I gonna cut straight to the problem: 
Regardless how hard my gf tried to arouse my dxxx, I have no feelings; my d even gets soften when she gives handjob/ blowjob. 
At later stage, I decided to do it myself to have my d in working condition, then let her continue. However, problem is my erected d always got soften when she uses her hand/mouth or try to ride on me...

I was excited before the session but then so disappointed...

I am completely confused, I thought usually it’s much easier for woman to get a guy cum than the opposite.

We had foreplay and I was so surprised how easy my gf cums during our foreplay, considering that it’s just halfway and I haven’t clicked on the resonant frequency yet; also, I haven’t used my d yet...

Before you troll and think I have ED or other physiological or psychological issues, I gonna tell u that it’s unlikely the case.
My d works completely fine when I do it myself. It shouldn’t be size issue as well. I am not sure what the average size is for Singaporean, but since my gf cannot fully hold my erected d with both hands so it should be big enough, relative to her hands, mouth and v......

We tried again in the morning but my d still not responding to her... ????

Even if it should not bother me whether she had sex with somebody else before me or not, I have been thinking much about it recently. I even confronted my girlfriend and tried to ask her. But it might be the way I asked her, she got upset and we had an argument. But she is still insisting that she never had sex with somebody else than me. I know that it should not be my business whether she did have sex or not before me. But how usual is that girls don't bleed the first time?

We're not that close; bigger oh no.

I don't know much about her but she is always on my mind. In every aspect she is out of my league and maybe that is what makes her so appealing. I brushed it off as me simply looking up to her but I soon realised that I was just trying too hard to lie to myself.

Whether we are even a good match? Questionable. Friends say yes, but my brain is thoroughly confused. The few friends that I've even told about this crush of mine have said that I stand a good chance because of how she reacts around me. However I don't see how she behaves around me as any different from how she would usually behave? 

Am I dense or am I just realistic? I want to be able to hope but I don't want to end up disappointing myself.

626,"Sorry in adv for the long post but I needed to get this off my chest and I’m scared my friends will judge me if I tell them.

Ive been with my ex-boyf, let’s call him G, since the start of Y1. We study diff subjects but I always made time to spend with him no matter how busy I got during lunch or wtv (I’m from a fac where the schedule is very hectic). In return he would always buy me food and pay for stuff. We applied for overseas exchange tgt and we got our same first choice of uni (in europe), and we made alot of plans to go travelling and stuff.

Truth is that as soon as I got accepted I started thinking of reasons to dump him. I just really wanted a angmoh boyf. I know it sounds bad but it’s like, G already got to have me to himself for 2 years and I was very loyal to him the whole time. I never even looked at any other guy and never went out with guys alone. I only get the chance to go on exchange once in my life and I didnt want to be burdened with something I chose in Y1, especially since it was so long ago.

So 1 week before we flew over (we bought tickets tgt) I changed my flight to an earlier one and broke up with G. I tried to be nice and I even had sex with him one last time before I left his place. Afterward he kept trying to text me and beg me to patch back but I didnt reply him.

Fast forward a week and I was settling in at the uni (not going to say which one incase people guess who I am) and I met this really hot angmoh, let’s call him B. B had short blonde hair and blue eyes like the waters of Bali. He was also taller than G (at least 180cm – I’m only 167 and G was 172) and had a very muscular chest and shoulders. When I first saw him I was like omgggggggg I literally died and came back to life and died again!!

He started talking to me on the first day of lectures and we instantly hit it off. He was so funny, and he understood me so well. It was perfect. When he asked me to hang out outside of class I immediately jumped at the chance! One day we went back to my room and started making out. I felt this attraction Ive never felt with G or any other SG guy before. After a few days we had sex for the first time. I was so shocked because I had never gone to homerun with anyone so fast before but we had this amazing connection, but it felt so right. I have always been a feminist and I wanted to be more sex-positive. I came from a very traditional background and my parents always wanted me to save myself. In the end I wanted to prove that this is my body, so I did a lot of ‘dirty’ things with B that I never even thought about doing with G.

As time went on I started seeing B less and less, and when we met it was always me going over to his house for sex. Sometimes he didnt use protection and just pulled out. I started getting angry with him and demanded to know where he was but he would start ignoring me. I didnt want to admit to myself that he was just using me, so I tried using the same tactics I used on G when we were together.

Soon B started avoiding me and in my sadness I messaged G again, thinking he would be desperate to get back tgt with me (he used to talk about BTO and kids so often it really freaked me out). When he didnt reply my repeated messages I stalked his insta and found out he got a angmoh girlf! They post all these gross couple workout videos and seeing him with her made me feel sick. I dont even know why she would be with him. He’s slightly shorter than her and his dick isn’t that big (I should know). And its not my fault that I wanted to try something new. G was so boring and he cant compete with B’s looks. I didnt even think angmohs would be interested in SG guys (she’s really very pretty).

Should I confront her for stealing him, even though I know that I broke up with him first? I’m really very conflicted and I feel so stupid and used. When I first saw their photos I let my anger get the better of me and I messaged G’s parents telling them that he dumped me for some angmoh slut. He didnt tell them about us so they got very angry and scolded him (they’re also very traditional). He messaged me yst and said that not just was he never going to talk to me again, but he never wanted to date a singaporean girl ever again because ‘european girls are so much better in every way’. I now know I was wrong, but I dont know what to do to fix it and I still want G back.

Thanks for reading my blog post. If you have any advice please comment I will be reading them...

I can get her to do literally anything in bed and satisfies me to my every need. I unfortunately have this urging physical sexual crush on one of her girlfriends who is really hot and cute. I’ve only made small conversations with her, but I don’t know if shes being nice or just flirting with me.

As a man I cant stop my sexual urges, but when I fantasize about her friend in particular, it just feels amazing. I don’t want a relationship with her and she never bring any guys around us. She does like to party but doesn’t give herself to any guy.

The worst thing is shes been friends with my girlfriend for a long time, and they are like best friends. Its nice we all love the same music so that’s a great bonding and they are both very smart. 
I really don’t want to hold this feeling inside anymore but I also don’t want to ruin my good relationship.

I am really scared that if I say “Hey I think you’re hot, lets have sex” or something around those lines, she could immediately go back to my gf n bam, now I lost both women.

I need some advice on this.. How do you go about this situation? I want to be able to ask subtle hints to her and see how it plays out. As a guy I do think she likes me but may not ever engage in sexual activity with me because of the fact im dating her friend. I just want to ask her and make sure she doesn’t tell my girlfriend.

628,"Is it possible to develop feelings for a girl after knowing her for 20 years? I’m 22 and she is 20. Both of our parents are close friends and during our childhood, we always had gatherings and according to my parents, I even help her hand b4. But yeap, that was when we were super young. But I'm not sure why, when i heard this from my parents, I actually got hooked onto hearing more. As time passes, since her parents got busier with their jobs, the only time we meet are during cny gathering. However, we became like strangers due to the lack of gatherings and i would always stay in my room to game whenever people came to visit. 

Anyways, this time we coincidentally got into the same school and same course. I don’t know if it’s fated or what but we are currently in the same clique too. After spending almost 5out of 7 days with the clique, I could sense that she really liked another guy and I got sort of jealous. I could also tell that she didn’t want to let others know about our childhood as she doesn’t address me the same way we always did before school starts - she would always call me “(my name) kor kor”. But because of this, I purposely teased her and call her how I usually do - “Qi Qi”. This is what all of our friends and family call her since young. Although she got irritated and mentioned not to call her that name, I actually felt delighted and accomplished. Like the guy she likes doesn’t have that privilege to do so. But rn, I don’t know how to proceed. I don’t even know if this is how it feels to like someone. And if so, how am I supposed to hint that i like her?

629,"Hi Prof Ben (and everyone else reading!) 

I have been together with my bf since poly, and we have both grad from uni and are working now. I can say he is generous and sweet towards me — pays for meals, goes the extra mile to show interest in my hobbies (even when I can tell he’s not too keen haha), etc. Overall, it looks like there’s nothing to complain about, and there is the kind of stability you mention in some of your relationship advice. However, there are some times (like, almost predictably every 4-6 months) when he walks out on me whenever we have a minor argument, or if i say something that accidentally triggers him (even though i don’t think it is really offensive, just being honest with what I think). On top of making me feel bad (but I’m slowly getting more numb to it lately), I think these walk-outs are quite immature. If I try to have a mature conversation about this, he will continue to stonewall me or change the topic.I can tell that he is uncomfortable (rather than intentionally trying to hurt me), so I have been dropping it. My feeling is that he walks out due to his inability/too tired to deal with the situation.  I am not sure if these incidents are worth tolerating in a long-term relationship, especially since it seems that they can be predictable. Would like to seek your insight and advice for my situation! Hope enough info has been provided.

631,"Me and my (ex-?)boyfriend we have been together for 3 years. We loved each other a lot, and even have plans for our future, getting BTO etc. However, things turned for the worst ever since we hit the 1 year mark, where we started to see compaitability issues, different outlook in life. But we tried our best to resolve them, or rather we would just leave it to be. He would often MIA when we start talking about this problem, coming out with excuses to avoid these serious talks. And leave me hanging or upset for the rest of the night.

He went for his exchange earlier this year and mine started on the later half of the year. We had no chance to meet at all as it overlaps, and hence it increased the frequency of our arguments. It surrounded mainly on how I am not prioritising him when he is the one who had no time for me (we only facetime once a month or not at all). He started thinking about a future that is according to his goals, his interest, and not me. What is the most important is, he never provided me the emotional support and I find myself going to someone else instead when in difficult situations. We have very different values. He often say he love me, but never actually act like he do.

So I decided that we had to take a break, that perhaps we will both reflect and be more accepting of our differences, since after all we really do love each other a lot. I brought that up and since then, it was the last time we talked, there was no closure, nothing.

But rather than trying to find a way to solve this, he immediately started using all the dating apps, hooking up with girls and going out on dates searching for a new partner. This isn't considered cheating but to be honest, it didn't feel really good. I took the time to heal and hoping we can get back together or find a way out of this, but all he did was give up on the relationship.

637,"Been in a relationship for 1 year plus. I know its rather short for people out there, but small conflicts have started to surface. My girlfriend is a very independent lady. Since both of us are in uni now, though different schools, I always try to make and effort to study with her. She loves studying at the National Library in bugis as she mentioned that the table there is huge, lights are bright, many seats and its located near her house. However, i live near Pasir Ris park and travelling to bugis is rather inconvenient. I tried to compromise with her, probably going to a library where it will be more accessible for both parties, but she is too stubborn to give in. She even mentioned that she is alright to study by herself, as both of us are doing vastly different courses and we cannot possibly talk in the library. 

Anyways, moving on, we have been dating for more than a year, but she hasn't met any of my friends. Not even my best friends. They've only heard of her from me and saw her pictures on my instagram but none of them ever saw her irl. They thought i hallucinated on having a girlfriend lol. She just doesn't seem to be interested in socialising with my circle of friends. I mean she was like this all the while, even before we dated and I'm quite licky i got to be her boyfriend considering the number of people she interact with on a daily basis. Although she also doesn't interfere with my social life, which may cause other guys to be jealous, since i have a couple of close fenale friends too, she doesn't seem to be too bothered. She doesn't check my phone or get suspicious whenever i goes to the club etc. Not that i have cheated on her but it just seems like she doesn't give a shit about me. My guy friends would occasionally bring their girlfriends out for dinner but me, eventhough attatched, is always alone, being the 3rd wheeler.

Sometimes i wonder if I'm too clingy. Or is it because I'm too ugly (which i honestly don't think so), hence she feels too secure whenever I'm out alone as no girls would prey on me.

I've been logging into insta using the new account I'd made a few days after we parted, so as to check up on your daily stories etc for over a year. Sadly, nothing has been posted until today. A picture of you and your new boyfriend popped up my screen. I really dont know how I should be feeling, maybe sad? Nope, because i know you've most probably managed to walk out of the gloomy days and better days await you. Happy? Not really, because I realise that I still love you and regretted what I've done that hurt you in the past, when you were still mine.

But I guess simply seeing me would reminds you of out past memories which would be best to for you to forget.

I used to enjoy it quite a lot, I very much looked forward to it, but now, it's become a routine I don't particularly enjoy. I find myself rather playing video games than having sex, which is very, very weird to me, as I'm the type of guy that would travel 2 hours for fifteen minutes of sex anytime.

Ever since my previous girlfriend broke up with me in 2016, I have had crushes on 7 girls out of which none of them have been interested in me and I have been friendzoned by all of them and hence they haven’t evolved past the stage of ‘crushes’. 

My problem is that when I do have a crush on someone, this feeling very quickly develops into an obsession, a very unhealthy obsession with that person. And this results in a few consequences. 

Firstly, either when I get rejected or when I find out she isn’t interested in me or when I find that she appears to be more interested in someone else, my mental health really takes a toll. I get depressed. And it really affects my ability to function normally. 

Secondly, the obsession also makes me do things that I don’t want to do and wouldn’t normally do. Obsessively stalking people on social media, getting seriously jealous of other people around her. It also causes me to try and make her like me, which could potentially cause her to feel uncomfortable. I know these are wrong, but I can’t seem to control myself.

Thirdly, I get way too intense way too fast. I start dreaming about potential futures we might share together, romantic moments we might share if we were together and my mind runs out of control. This happens to the extent that thoughts of her would occupy my mind every moment I am awake and prevents me from concentrating on anything else.       

I need help. I can’t seem to control how I think or how I feel. There is only so much I can do to suppress these feelings and emotions. I don’t want to live like this anymore. These obsessions not only hurt me but also make the girl feel uncomfortable and I feel terrible about that. There is only so much I can do to control the extent to which I act on these obsessions.

For some context, I have been single for the last 4 years. I am someone who is emotionally quite empty. I have a void that I am hoping a relationship can fix (although I have been told that this doesn’t work). I have come to realise is that what I actually may be in love with is the idea of a relationship and not necessarily the person I would be in a relationship with. I have been told that the solution to this is to first love myself and to fill the void in me before I get into a relationship. 

But  my question is, how exactly do I love myself? What does loving oneself look like? What steps do people take in order to ‘love themselves’ 

Secondly, how does one fill the emotional void. I know people suggest things like hobbies or gyming etc but how do these things actually fill the emotional void? I feel at best they distract you from the fact that the void exists but even the distraction is only temporary. Hence it is a very unsustainable solution.  So ho do I fill the void?

Whenever I feel down and wish to cry I will control it. This is because you must always show people the strong side of you. In order to prevent people from taking advantage of you. 
But thing started to change when I met this girl. We know each other for quite some time. She is an introvert too. But when we hang out together, we sat there for hours talking about everything under the sun. I like who I am when I with her. I feel happy and safe when telling her about my personal life and my stories. She is a good listener. Her feeling is always my priorities. Whenever she is in a negative situation I will be upset too.

She might not realize this, but when she smile that is what completes every day of mine. And how I wish she was mine. Knowing eachother need days and years, I hope I can be the one taking care of you one day.

We have gone for 2 dates so far and there is mutual attraction as we both felt sparks.  We chat almost every day and our conversations flow easily.  The problem is that I am falling in love with him I am not quite sure he feels the same way as he has commitment issues. So, we had a small argument about that recently and he has not been talking to me properly after that. I asked him yesterday if he can see me as a potential girlfriend. His reply was ""You would make a good gf for sure (hugging face emoji)."" Now, I am super confused by his message as he did not answer my question directly. I do not know what he is trying to say. Guys out there, please help me decipher the meaning of this message. He is now overseas on a business trip and will be back after 2 weeks so I do not want to bother him.

I thought it would be some common couple tattoos where we would have one another’s name or some rs quotes on a part of the body or whatsoever, but no. This was the reply she gave me…

“You will tattoo, Dear (insert her name here), I love you and will be loyal to you forever. Your presence is like the moon in the sky and the cash in my wallet.

I matched with a guy on Tinder a while back. We hit it off quite well and met for dessert about two days after matching. He then took me back to his house to meet his dog as I casually mentioned that I was fond of animals. We ended up making out and doing more than just that. Continued to keep in touch and wanted to go on more outings but our schedule didn't permit us. He kept talking about how much fun he had that day and that he can't wait to see me again. However, he got attached soon after but we still texted and he was still very keen to meet up. We made plans but he canceled at the last minute saying he was very tired, which I accepted as he had just returned from a trip. We still kept talking after that and he split with his girlfriend but suddenly, he just cut contact and disappeared.

I actually got unhappy when he is with other girls. (But what rights do I have haha)

664,"I've been seeing all these posts about love life or crushes and wanting to be in a relationships. 

So here's my two cents on this.

If you ever ever want to be in a Relationship because you either wanna feel ""complete"" or ""have someone by yourside"" or feel loved everyday, my advice to you is, don't. 

Relationships were never meant to fill gaps in your heart and erase your solidarity in life. It's up to you to do this on your own for god's sake, don't expect someone to love you when you yourself, don't even love who you are. 

Love yourself first. Then improve on your own qualities not for that ""special someone"", but for yourself first. There's always this chinese saying ""愛人入己"" (Love others like how you love yourself) for a reason.

If you ever want to be in a relationship because ""Waaaah drama so sweet worr the guy and girl so cute together keep doing cute thingies together siaa, I wish I can be like them!!!!!"", don't.

Life isn't like your Taiwan or Korean or Chinese or ""The fault in our stars"" or ""Twilight"". They paint you rosy pictures of how relationships are. Don't you ever wonder why are the guy and girl leads always so free? They can do all these cutsy stuff together so often, gazing deeply into each of their eyes, smudging icecream on their noses, promising to love each other forever?

That's because dramas...they don't really show how busy a person's life can be and yeah, they don't show the responsibilities. (I'm referring to work or studying religiously for the exams)

No one have all the time in the world to be with one another 24/7 and do cute surprises every now and then, excluding the once in a bluemoon surprises for celebrations or popping by for surprises.

When you and your partner are busy working/studying, there's not much time for all these cutsy stuff or lovey-dovey outings almost everyday or multiple times a week. There isn't. 

Sure there can be surprises but don't ever expect love lifes to be as fulfilling as K-Dramas when you two reach adulthood.

Bottom line is, Love yourself first before loving someone or else you're going to depend on your partner for your own happiness, which shouldn't be the case. You're suppose enrich your partner's life, and they will too, not leeching onto each other's life to fill in a gap inside you.
And ohh. Keep love life realistically. Everyone have their own life going on, and your partner isn't orbiting around you 24/7.

668,"Back in my poly days, I fell in love with a guy. He was handsome and charming, while I was ugly and fat. I knew that I had no chance with him, so I just watched from afar with loving eyes while he hung out with all the pretty, popular girls. 

A woman's determination is a powerful thing. While the love of my life trained in NS, I did some ""training"" of my own: With a combination of exercise, dieting and slimming pills, I was able to slim down to a size 4, which is still fat by asian standards but a far cry from the baby hippo that I was in poly. More importantly, slimming down gave me a huge confidence boost and made me feel like anything was possible.

When the love of my life finished NS and entered NUS, I quickly found a mutual friend to introduce us.  That day, for the first time in my life, the love of my life actually gazed at me for more than 3 seconds. I could sense the hunger in his eyes.  I felt loved, wanted, desired. I felt like a woman.

The next few months were the happiest time of my life. We held hands together everywhere we went, as if our very fingertips were welded together by the burning fires of love. When we ate together, we would feed each other and every other bite would end with a kiss, not necessarily on the mouth. When we took the shuttle bus together, we would hug each other tightly and let the gently swaying motions of the bus bring us to paradise. The night I gave him my virginity, I remember how he ripped off my clothes like an animal and started kissing every inch of my body. Slowly but surely, my facebook feed became filled with the happy, laughing pictures of us together. It was as if the old fat and ugly me had never existed. 

Sadly, every happy moment has to come to an end. Several months into the relationship, I began to gain weight again. In response, I increased my intake of slimming pills, but the pills were ineffective. I was also starting to feel unwell: I was feeling drowsy and sleepy all the time, I vomited frequently, I felt frequent pains in my abdomen area, and I missed my period. At first, I thought I might be getting pregnant, but when I started bleeding heavily, I began to sense that something might be horribly wrong. Before long, it became clear what the problem was: I had indeed gotten pregnant but the slimming pills caused a miscarriage, as well as lasting harm to my body. I cried and cried that day in the doctor's office. My parents threw away the rest of my slimming pills. 

Today, I am back to my original poly weight. The love of my life left me. All that is left of the relationship are the medical bills and the frequent visits to various doctors. Apparently, the damage caused by the slimming pills was quite severe and even the specialists assigned to my case are unsure if I will ever fully recover. I am also warned by the doctors that getting pregnant in the near future may lead to complications.  

Given my present weight and the health issues mentioned above, it is unlikely that I will ever find another guy again, so the story of my love life probably ends here.  Yesterday afternoon, as I was taking the shuttle bus back home from UHC, I started thinking about my ex again. I had given him everything that is possible for a woman to give a man. Logically speaking, I should hate him. Yet somehow, I felt no hate at all, only love. After all, he was the love of my life. I would have gladly given up my entire life just to spend another minute with him. I only wish that my stupid fat body could have stayed slim just a little longer so that our time together didn't have to end so quickly. As things stand, our story was short but sweet, the most beautiful thing I have ever known, the most beautiful thing I will ever know. I am happy.

Was in the same position last year. I thought we were stable, independent, not too clingy and still loving when we met over the weekends. Towards the last year he outwardly told me he didnt like my family, but wanted me to take care of his mum as he was not able to. I kept going over to his place as he was tired. but during my working training phase, I was just as tired as he was in army. In fact I was always accomodating towards him during his army days. But my efforts didnt seem to work out. 

He initiated a break earlier on but regretted almost instantly. Yet he made no efforts to change for the next half a year and made excuses like ""Im like this, I cant change"". After I gave the ultimatium, he admited that he fell for another girl at his internship. He confessed to her, just so he can hear her rejection and then focus his attention on me. Which he realised he was being a jerk and thus agreed to end the relationship. 

Im happily attached now to some one who cares and appreciates me. Dont be in a relationship where you are the only one putting in effort. Youre tired, time to leave.

I totally didn't expect the amount of hate I got from my confession. Maybe because I haven't added more details. But here goes.

678,"I (M) started using CMB recently, and have been getting a healthy number of matches. For context, I’m average looking with an average build, have a decent professional job, and am looking for something serious. 

However, I’ve had a daunting and tiring experience. 

Most of my matches “liked” my profile but either kept completely quiet, or took ages to reply (e.g. 1 day). Several matches, though highly educated (e.g. some graduated with a FCH), do not bother responding to my questions, and respond with replies that display zero sincerity. Now while I do appreciate that we all have a life outside of dating apps, I still take the effort to reply my matches as often as I can - my work typically ends around 8-11pm or later, and I do not use CMB while at work.

Recently, I was offered a free CMB premium trial, and am now able to view the stats of all of my matches. This has led me to some interesting observations:

(1) Many girls reply to only around 20-30% of their chats.

(2) The better-looking matches tend to be more reluctant to start chats, and also tend to reply less to chats.

(3) Numerous girls tend to reply after at least 10-12 hours. These girls are also typically those who reply to fewer chats.

To all the LADIES out there, out of curiosity, why do girls return “likes” but keep completely silent / display a complete lack of interest thereafter? I find this very baffling because if you aren’t interested at all, then why “like” my profile in the first place?

For avoidance of doubt, I did not notice any fake profiles.

Slowly, I start developing feeling toward her. I do a lot of silly things for her. From care to love. I always thought I am cool about this, but things aren’t as easy as I think. She has a bf. In the beginning, I can feel how much she loves her bf. But now I feel unhappiness and disappointment from her relationship. Seriously, I wasn’t quite happy about how her bf treated her. Cos I always think if you are in a committed relationship, you must always care about another half. I wasn’t expecting much from her until recently I really couldn’t take it anymore. I think she deserves someone better; someone really treats her well and take care of her. 
When the feeling gets stronger, I became demanding. I want her to care about me as I do. In the end, we quarreled. I still remember that is one time we have this huge quarrel and I told her I don’t want to be her friend anymore. (what a wrong move). We used words to hurt each other like a weapon. And we stop texting and hangout for the next 2 days. During the cool-down period is really a hell for me. I couldn’t sleep in the night. All I think about is how is she doing today? Did she have any gastric pain from skipping dinner again? And many more. After 2 days of hell, I finally pick up my phone and sent her a text message asking her how she been doing the last 2 days. She replied was cold. After exchanging a few messages, she said she wants to stop all this drama as she couldn’t handle it anymore. I so afraid of losing her I keep repeating asking her is it her final decision. At that moment I realized I am losing her forever as a friend. I panicked but I handle it well. I told her I respect her decision as long as she is happy. And she told me she will be happy this way. 
On and off I will text her asking her personal life. Her replied is so short and cold. We stopped texting, and whenever I am alone, I will think of what I told her before. This is what I told her before if one day we ever drift apart, and for any reason, you can’t reach me by text, you can just pop by my house and tell me you are fine”. This is all I wanted to know from her. 
After I few days of waiting, she finally texted me. I was so shocked and happy at the same time. She asked me how I am, and my first reply to her is I miss her so much! And she replied she misses me too. That moment is unforgettable. 
Right now, although we remain as friend and hangout. But I keep my feeling toward her. I don’t want to give her any more pressure and I just want her to be happy. Sometime when I see her unhappy or sad about certain things, I will try my best to bring a smile back to her. Looking into her eye and tell her how gorgeous and beautiful she is. This way will make me happy too. And, I will bring her favorite foods, drink, and snacks whenever I can. I not trying to replace her bf or anyone else, I will just be honest to myself. Cos I really think she deserves all this treatment and also someone really appreciates her. 
I couldn’t sleep this few nights. Many things are going through my head. Time is running out for me; all I can do now is to treat her the best I could and make her happy every time we meet.
And I really hope one day I can be…

This whole month felt surreal. Trevor is the most caring and loving guy i've ever dated and i've never felt so connected with anybody before. However 2days back, his ex left me a message that she is pregnant with Trevor's child. Apparently his ex also told him the same and wanted him back. Trevor claims that they have not had any bedroom activities for at least 3months and it is impossible that the child belongs to him. 
What should I do? Wait 8 months to possibly find out that he is Father to another woman's child? I'm really into him but I do not want my child to share a Father with another woman's.

694,"Hi.

To put things shortly, I have been dating my partner for a little over half a year now. Yes, I know that to most of the relationship gurus out there, this may be an incredibly short amount of time. I'd ideally like to say that in this short amount of time, I have gotten to learn a lot more than about my partner, about relationships (this is not my first), and most importantly about myself than most tend to do. I recently (a couple of months now) have been having doubts about this relationship. I feel that sure, my partner and I have been decently happy and supportive of each other yet at the same time, I feel that this person is not the one. It's not a problem with my partner or anything like that, I just feel that we are not exactly the optimal pair.

The replies I get can usually be split into two categories; ""no couple is an optimal pair"" or ""don't give up too soon"". To the former, my idea is that sure we aren't optimal but it isn't difficult to find someone who would be a much better match for the other. To the latter, I'm ok with giving it more time, I just don't want things to be prolonged unnecessarily.

I've left out certain details like the genders purposefully. Advice is welcomed.

She told me that she would prefer guys with mature look. She also mentioned that her best friend thought that I was her little brother when she saw us walking together. *Almost Fainted* *Facepalm* How is it possible? We are of the same age! 

It was a very embarrassing moment but I do really appreciate her honesty. When I asked her whether it is possible for us to move forward into a relationship, she changed the topic (moved on with the conversation.) 

Before we left the restaurant, I told her that I would like to send her home (by the reliable MRT). To my surprise, she said: “Oh yes, if you don’t mind?” (Smile). When I was on the way back home, she sent me a thank-you text after that.   

Do I still have a chance with her? (Hi, I am a guy)

699,"I am in a committed relationship with my girlfriend. We have been going out unofficially since sec school and dating officially since poly.  I have already unofficially proposed to her and we intend to get married after I graduate.

Sometime last semester, I met Jenny. Jenny is an angel who was banished from heaven for distracting her colleagues at work. Jenny is pretty, sweet and charming. Unlike my girlfriend, who is the more ""homely"" type and chose not to continue studying after poly, Jenny and I are both ambitious and career minded people. I feel that I am able to talk to Jenny about my career aspirations and life goals, conversations which are impossible with my current girlfriend. Also, unlike my girlfriend, who is obsessed with unwatchable kpop nonsense, Jenny and I share more common interests and there is never a shortage of things to talk about. We did projects in school together. We went for career fairs/school events together. We watched endgame together. We even stayed up late past midnight at my place for football (and other nighttime action).

I truly, honestly, fervently believe that Jenny is my soulmate, the girl that God planned for me to spend my life with. Sometimes, in the middle of a boring football game where both teams are playing leg tennis, I start to imagine my future with Jenny: buying a condo and car together, raising beautiful and smart kids together, saving up for retirement and migrating to australia together. Sometimes, in the middle of a really boring football game where both teams are playing leg golf, I fantasize about actually going ahead and breaking up with my girlfriend to be with Jenny.  There were times when I picked up my phone, composed a breakup text, hovered over the ""send"" button, said a prayer and... did nothing.

In the final analysis, I just couldn't do it. My relationship with my girlfriend is way too deep: we recently put down a deposit for BTO. I may no longer feel any love for my girlfriend, but responsibility trumps love.

This is not a confession looking for advice. I know what I must do: in fact, I did it already. The last time Jenny and I made love, we hugged each other tightly till morning came and she left my life forever like an angel on a sunbeam. 

Jenny, Jenny, Jenny... you are my june angel, my gem among many, my joy and my end. God played a cruel trick on both of us by letting us meet only when it was way too late. We will never be physically together ever again, but my mind, my soul, my spirit is yours, now and forever, till the end of our days.

After the event, she invited me for the afterparty (free entry), cause she say doesn't like clubbing with people that she's not close with, but I was out studying and not dressed to club. And if I wasn’t going, she was going to go home.

We grew up together and were from the same sch throughout till now in NUS. So it started out in sec sch where we got closer and more comfortable with each other, theres this one cca basketball practice where we showered together and were very open with one another.
We became best of bros and everytime i go to his house we are naked studying in his room??? And he even initiated watching porn together(mind u, he is attached with his gf at that time). So i said ok and we somehow became more than best friends. So despite having a girlfriend, we still help each other mutually as we are bro fap buddies. Fast forward, i now have a girlfriend but she says im not forking out enough time for her?? Half the time shes always complaining that i spend more time with my best friend than her but what m i suppose to do when i alr know him for almost a decade??
My gf ever mentioned that shes opened to the idea of a threesome, im not sure if she will be ok with the idea of a 3some with my best friend, seeing that she gets very jealous of our strong friendship most of the time.
I too, am not very sure if i am alright with some guy penetrating her, i dont really like to share my girlfriend as im very possessive and i dont like the idea of her being used by someone else. Im thinking that maybe he can penetrate me instead? 
Besides these, my best friend is currently single and i dont want him to feel lonely on his own. I am thinking of proposing the idea of a three-person relationship with her, ill probably be more alright with my best friend screwing her if the 3 of us are in a relationship, but this is so uncommon in singapore n im not sure how it will work out.

I don’t know whether it is you who wrote the confession but I have been longing for you for so long. Ever since I started working in a new place for the past days and months, I had made alot of amazing friends who are more cheerful than you and gained alot of experience more than the place we worked together. To be honest, I am much more happy when I have new workplace, perhaps you are very happy too without me being working together with you anymore. 

This world doesn’t accept the lovely bond of both of us and you are the one who said that we are nothing but only as a friend. Only God know how hurtful my heart is when you told me such a words. 

We had fun alot to be honest, perhaps we enjoyed the time being together, along these years. But along the way, our heart changed and it makes for both of us having hard time to forget each other. Perhaps it is just a few stairs away from each other, but I am like you whom feel like it is million miles a way. 

You don’t need to force yourself to stop contacting me. I am the one who deciding to be away from you, for the sake of our hearts’ healing. You are never been as someone lousy in my eyes, no matter how much mistakes you did, I will always forgive you as you are always perfect in my eyes. 

Don’t blame it on our circle of life, as it comes from our own heart who decided to be separated like this. Perhaps because of our differences in preferences of feeling, we are ended up like this. 

Yes, we are strangers now, but I always peek at your glances whenever we passed thru each other, seeing unto your eyes who longing for being together with each other, where I have been longing for it too. 

Perhaps we are not ended well in terms of our friendship and relationship, but I always love you for the way you are but you are already have someone with you now and this is the time I will go away and forget your existence. But always remember, I will always love you. Maybe in 10 or 20 or 30 years in time, you will have a family and I might be still as a single star who longing for an Earth whom only looks at the moon, waiting for my own shine to fade.

He told me that he does have plans for us to be together, but it will not be so soon, and his wife also knows about the affair. It seems feasible for us to be together, but I can't bring myself to break up a family. My mind tells me to leave, because this is not my first time being involved with a married man, I know how difficult it is for us to continue the relationship. A divorce involves both families and financial issues, and I have to bear the thought of him returning to his wife after our every encounter. But my heart is not listening, somehow the thought of leaving him is worse than being a third party...

724,"Why do people always equate thinking about your ex as not having moved on? 

I’m currently happily attached in a 4-year relationship (this is only my second) but occasionally, I still see photos of my ex pop up on our mutual friends’ instagram posts. These photos trigger memories and sometimes my mind just thinks about her and wonder if she’s doing well, if she’s coping well in life because last I heard from a mutual friend was that, her dad got cancer. 

But I have friends asking me why do I wonder about her from time to time.. and they think that it’s because I have not yet truly moved on.

725,"This girl has been my study buddy and labmate for some modules for the last couple of years. Over time, my fondness for her grew. She is streetsmart, academically smart, caring, and good looking. She comes from a family with financial difficulties, and she works part-time to help her family. Lately, I got signals from her that my fondness is reciprocated. We just got into year 4 and I thought it is a good time to confess. So I did a couple of weeks ago. She said she likes me too, but she wanted me to know some things about her that I did not know, which of course, she expects me to keep secret. She told me that her part-time work is as an escort, which involves physical aspects as well. She added that she wouldn't have been able to maintain her social life, academics, CCAs etc. if her financial support to her family came from a normal seven dollar per hour part-time work. I am not one of those guys who expect the partner to have zero sexual experience even though I am in that category myself - I had voluntarily declined chances to be off the mark casually and am proud to have done so. I find it hard to come to terms with it and be with her, though in all other aspects she is too good to let go. She understands that it is not an easy decision, and has told me to take as much time as I want to think it over. She will keep her part-time work suspended in the meantime, and will terminate it if we get together. It is very easy to say “if you like someone, his/her past shouldn’t matter”, until you are in the hot seat yourself. Not really looking for advice, just sharing it here to get it off my chest.

726,"So I have had a lot girls, for whom I’ve had feelings for but they haven’t really liked me back or have just friendzoned me. The way I have dealt with these feeling so far is that everytime, someone has broken up with me, rejected me or I have felt that they don’t like me, I have suppressed those feelings, instead of actually trying to resolve them. The way I have gone about this is to replace the feelings and fantasies about that person, with fantasies about another person (whom I haven’t actually had feelings for). The fantasies are mostly non-sexual. Just mostly about what my life would be like if I were together with that person. Mostly just romantic. It has mostly been successful so far.  

So the situation right now is this. I had feelings for a girl, lets call her Person A. I liked her for a long time and I eventually confessed to her and she rejected me. So then I proceeded to suppress those feelings by replacing her with another person (Person B) in my fantasies. Person B is someone I know. The problem is that  as a side effect of this strategy, I ended up falling for Person B. I realise that Person B isn’t interested in me so I tried to suppress my feelings for her by fantasising about Person C but now I feel I am digging my hole deeper. Person C is a platonic friend whom I was never interested in, romantically. Now I realise that in the process of trying to suppress my feelings for person B, I have started developing feelings for Person C. (It’s a mess I know). So I halted the process in the middle.  

I don’t want to confess to either person B or C because they are both my friends and I dont want to sabotage my friendship, even though getting rejected might help me move on. So now, even though I eventually got over person A  I have unresolved feelings for B and C.  And this is seriously messing with my head and it is confusing me no end. I don’t think either of them actually like me, romantically and they are both out of my league. So what do I do? How do I recover my sanity again? How do I stop myself from feeling this way?

As much as we can, we try to have open communication and tell each other about our troubles and issues that we face. The problem is, sometimes the issues that either of us face, the other party can’t simply solve by giving advice. 

In the case where I’m dealing with some problems, I feel helpless about the issue at hand, and also feel hurt for making him feel useless. I thought of being less vocal about my problems and hiding my worries from him, but this forms the core of our relationship. He said that although having such an open communication leads to this kind of situations where we feel helpless and unable to help one another, in doing so we also share our burdens and it’s something we value and cherish.

I don’t want to hurt him but it seems like I will either way. Is this sustainable in the long run???

733,"So there is this girl I like. We became close fairly recently. I am not sure if she likes me back. Here’s why. 

Whenever we are alone, just me and her, she seems to be very affectionate towards me. She would lean against me, rest her head on my shoulder, hold my hand, hug me, whenever I put my arm around her she would reciprocate etc. However, when we are in public, i.e with friends (mutual friends mostly) she acts a bit more distant. She wouldn’t act as affectionately. Even whenever I would put my arm around her she won’t react. She doesn’t get very close to me even when we are talking to each other. Basically somewhat opposite to how she is when we are alone. 

What does this mean? Why would she act this way?

739,"I am the OP of #68663, responding to the comments suggesting that the CMB profiles I was referring to are fake. One Xu S Han, for instance, claimed that “CMB uses fake profiles to con carrots like you”. 

While I think there is some force in the claim that the profiles I had referred to in my earlier post are fake, I thought I should just highlight a couple of indicators that point strongly against that.

First, my friends and I had, in the past, matched with some of these bagels. These bagels in fact responded to our messages, at least in the first two days. They also typed in a colloquial, local manner. However, it usually became quickly obvious from their responses that they were not interested. 

Second, these bagels have, over time, updated their profiles, whether it be job title, descriptions, new photos and even the order of their photos. I am generally quite observant, and can remember these little details very easily.

Third, as some of these bagels are actually friends of my friends, I have incidentally chanced upon a few of their Facebook profiles (from group pictures and Facebook posts). Interestingly, the photos used in their CMB profiles are completely different from those they had uploaded on Facebook. Obviously, CMB could not have magically created these photos out of nowhere. They were not photoshopped. 

Fourth, and as absurd as this sounds, I think this is one of those situations where it is apt to use the phrase “you know it when you see it”. Feel free to disagree, but I think those of us who have used CMB will get my drift. 

Needless to say, I’m not suggesting that these permanent residents of CMB are doing anything wrong. Rather, the behaviour of these bagels is merely a reflection of a social phenomenon that has arisen with the advent of online dating (read my earlier post). 

On a final note, apart from the points raised in my earlier post, I think it is safe to say that for most of us using CMB, it becomes increasingly easy over time to sieve the chaff from the wheat.

741,"I (M) started using CMB again recently, two years after I deleted my account. 

Out of curiosity, I scrolled through the profiles of the female bagels in the Discover section, with the option “Active within the last 72 hours” selected. 

Interestingly, I spotted many familiar-looking bagels who I had “liked” previously, two to three years ago. Most of them are at least a 7/10.

Initially, I thought that these girls might perhaps, like me, have returned to CMB (for various reasons) after staying away from it for a while. However, this notion quickly proved to be wrong when I started seeing more and more familiar faces.

To be sure, I showed some of the profiles to a few friends of mine who are active CMB users (more so than I am). My friends unanimously agreed that they had seen these same profiles for an extended period of time.

I cannot help but wonder why so many pleasant-looking girls have continued using CMB for such a long time. 

Is CMB really bereft of decent chaps, so much so that this has left them to become permanent CMB residents? Or are people just overly caught up in the illusion of “choice”, to the extent that they end up spending so much time men searching for the elusive “one”.

In any event, as someone who’s using CMB to find something serious, I know what to do when these familiar-looking profiles appear as suggested matches.

The rest of them knew each other for close to 1 year except me, I might know a few of them but they are more like hi bye friend in school and we don’t talk much at all.

So moving on, I noticed that the club president (let call him A) tend to talk to me more than others during our weekly training, and soon these talks involve some physical contact eg scaring me by laying his head on my shoulder or hugging me from behind. I understand he is trying to be friendly to me since im new to the team. One day, we were just joking around and I took his phone and accidentally saw his phone wallpaper, a pic of him and a girl (she is also part of the team, but she is busy with her internship so she does not come for training every week, let call her B). I pretend I didn’t saw it obviously. From then, I noticed that he does not have any physical contact with me when B is around, but only do so when B is not around. There were many times he will send me home after cca (I stay at amk but he stays in hall btw), and when I ask him why does he do that, he always say he just bored and just want to accompany me. As time passed, he started to find me more often, like waiting outside my lecture hall and going lunch & dinner together at least 3 times a week.

Then somehow I found out from his friends that A likes me that why he told the team that he wants me in the committee team. Ofc I continue act normal in front of him.

753,"Hi all, I'm 23M. I, too, think I'm above average looking (I do get asked out whilst in the office and even by various genders in camp, but no, I do not get harassed). To describe my intelligence in less identifiable terms, I scored 1600 on the SAT, and got 50/50 for the PI LI/CA I took for this summer's internship process. I'm an INTJ-A and I'd like to think that I handle myself well socially -- I'm usually the one pitching/presenting ideas and projects, and my promoter friends regularly ask me to help with their guest lists. I don't have the body of a Greek god but I gym often and get comfortable IPPT Golds. I also keep myself well-read and up to date with current affairs.

The thing is this: I’m evergreen. Though unlike olive oil, I’m green but not extra virgin. This fact seems to bother those around me more than it bothers me: Guys assert that I’m trying to live a playboy lifestyle (I do go out on a fair bit of dates, but I have never led anyone on if the feeling is not mutual; Sex only after consent and trust is established), and girls think that I’m lying. Not having social media accounts only furthers their beliefs. 

I simply do not feel that I’m missing out on life by not having a girlfriend. Admittedly, some counter that by claiming that I do not know what I’m supposed to miss out on in the first place. While that makes sense, I’m more affected by what my middle-aged friends say: “Find someone early before all the ‘good ones’ are taken and you end up with one of those being ‘left on the shelf’ ”.

Some time back, I had the opportunity of talking to a qualified professional on this matter. After we established that I’m neither doubting my sexuality nor having hormonal issues, the only advice he left with me was to “just give it time”.

What do you people think? Cast all standards and doubts aside to taste the fruit that is a ‘steady’ relationship? Get some relationship experience before the lack of it becomes a liability? Live my life as before?

My chest basically looks like someone just punched my ribs and dented it. However, with my shirt on, I look perfectly normal and built due to my broad shoulders. Because of this condition, i used to avoid any activites that need me to take off my top. I have quite a low self esteem due to this and avoid getting into r/s for fear that girls will find it distasteful and break up with me after finding out about it.

Long story short, I met the love of my life (now my fiancè) through a friend. After dating for some time, we got together. However, i did not have the courage to tell her before we got together for fear of her rejecting me. I eventually decided to tell and show her my chest shortly after, to be fair to her. Shorter pain is better than longer pain. I am deeply touched when she didn't mind it at all and accepted me for who I am. 

We are now happily engaged and looking forward to our wedding and future together.

People often assume that I am perfectly healthy and fit( I looked like I gym a bit).

I was completely devastated and my self-esteem for find a R/S fell rock-bottom(still is). But, I understand her point.

Now that i am older most of my friends are busy with R/S too. Friday and Saturday nights is going to get more and more lonely. I sort of have a crush on this girl I met in the first two weeks of uni.

The problem now I am traumatize to ask a girl out now (like on a date.) I feel that I don't deserve love and to be loved (romantically).

what should I do? Anybody with facing the same life issues as me, Could you give me some advise?

761,"Had a friend in JC, we were kinda close and we'd just tell each other stories and stuff. She was going through a rough time one day with her boyfriend, mentioned that he'd hit her when they fought and whatnot. So as a good ""sister"" I advised her on stuff, and basically just was there for her throughout.

Didn't think it was my place to suggest they break up, but if and when she brought it up, I was there to objectively weigh out the options.

So recently they (finally) broke up, and think it became quite the debacle in our friend groups, even spilling out onto social media, Twitter and Insta and what-have-you. Nothing new, just them washing all those years of dirty laundry. Somehow I got dragged into it, and for some reason somehow I became the reason she even thought of breaking up.

I think - and know - that she's making me the scapegoat for this, and I don't like it one bit. She's pinning the entire thing on me, and I'm really just quite pissed off at this point since she's really trying hard to make it look like it's somehow my fault or my ""coercion""

Thing is, back in JC, she told me that one day after she and her boyfriend had argued, she'd hooked up with some other guy in school backstage - I'm inclined to ""help"" her ex by letting him know about this entire thing; she'll know it was me but at this point I don't really care.

I'm more concerned about the other guy in the story, because the real reason they broke up is something similar to this, and I don't think the other guy deserves what's probably coming to him by being dragged into the drama. He's personally one of my good friends too, and it's for that reason I haven't told anyone.

As far as I can tell, my friend and this other guy hasn't had any contact since we graduated about 5 years ago, and honestly I think she was just making use of him for her personal gain.

I'm still in some contact with him, and I think I should leave out his name from it, but I'm just worried that his identity might just come out eventually...

Don't know what to do, the leprechaun hats are strong with this one.

762,"My current boyfriend is a second year student in the same faculty as I am. Last academic year, since he was still new, I spent alot of time helping him with his coursework. I would explain the lecture concepts to him, show him how to do his tutorial questions and even complete his project work for him. I also helped him to create handwritten notes and cheatsheets for his exams. With my help, his year 1 CAP is FCH material, and both of us are very happy about it.

As the new academic year begins, he approached me for help with coursework again. As his girlfriend, I don't mind satisfying him occasionally if he really needs it. However, I don't feel comfortable with spoon-feeding him anymore especially since he is in year 2 now and supposed to be independent. It seems that our relationship is gradually turning into a ""sex for grades"" relationship, except that my boyfriend is getting both the sex AND the grades.  Just thinking about it leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

So this girl I have like for some time has been a long time good friend of mine. She used to be attached in a long term relationship and now she is attached again, this time to a somewhat toxic relationship (from the way she described it). Basically her current bf is somewhat suicidal and she is kinda forced to be with him as she is afraid he might do something stupid. She intends to continue the relationship until the guy is emotionally stable or can do without her. 
Knowing this, should I continue to pursue her? Or should I just move on for now? I felt that’s our personalities are very compatible and that I also care a lot about her. I worry especially her mental health because she’s been struggling with her past and present relationships. Any good advice for how I should approach this?

He enlisted in January and we maintained our relationship throughout his bmt period and after he's posted to his vocation. I've heard stories of ns breakups but I thought we could survive it. However, after I went to an orientation camp, one particular guy in my og caught my eye. He looks like an ah beng (I think he's hot, but this may just be my own opinion) but is actually evergreen, to my surprise. I've had an ex who was actually one, and he was abusive and manipulative for the few months we were together. I was too naive in secondary school and thought I could 'tame' his wild behaviour. After I broke up with him, in JC I got together with my current boyfriend who was the 'guai' type, focused on studies, no clubbing, drinking, gambling, whatever. I'm instantly attracted to his appearance and vibe, but pushed those thoughts to the back of my mind since I was attached. We talked during the camp, but didn't contact each other privately after camp. I can't stop thinking of him. When uni started, I hoped I could bump into him on campus. We did, he said hi and I said hi back and we went our separate ways, as we were in different courses in the same faculty. I don't think I'll call off my relationship, as I love my boyfriend a lot, but I'm not sure what to do with the obsession of my og mate.

Based on certain issues, I decided to let the r/s go and ended things. However, I started seeing someone after 1-2 weeks ish after breaking up. Is this normal? But to my defence I already wanted to end the previous r/s and have been emotionally letting things go before finally ending it proper. I have gotten advice from people that (the current one) it’s a rebound, it won’t last, it’s wrong, I shouldn’t do it, etc. I have also heard some nasty stuff that I wasn’t serious for my previous r/s and that’s why I got over it/him so quickly. And so I wouldn’t be serious about the current one as well. But things happens for reasons and no one can ever know what I felt then and there. Any advice out there? Greatly appreciate it.

Two week ago, after a night out at a pub, we tried to do it at his hostel and he revealed his reason for abstaining. His little brother is no longer than a USB stick. Of course I said it was no issue, but after an awkward 10 minutes of attempting to make it happen, he broke down and started crying. He said his exgf left him for this exact reason and he feels guilty for not telling me earlier on, and started begging me not to leave him. I reassured him that it's really not an issue, as I truly felt that sex wasn't all that important.

If you do not forget, you let her go. I cannot imagine if you continue to be with her, and you are being reminded of this incident over and over again. You will quarrel with her, you will belittle her, you will want to take a knife and stab her because you can never forget. Why make yourself go through such torture. Why make her believe you forgive her? Save yourself, save her, stop being with her. Imagine you married her, build a family and still be reminded of her cheating everyday. Is it fair for your child? By then, if you want to let go, you are hurting everyone else. Even by then, my advice will still be let her go, you are saving yourself.

769,"Do people change from being an extrovert to an introvert without experiencing any life changing event? 

I've (21F) been in a rs with this guy (21M) since JC2. And back then, before he got enlisted, I was rather extroverted, or should i say i was leaning towards the extroverted side of the scale. However, as i grew older, i realised that i really enjoy spending my time alone. I enjoy watching movies alone, studying alone, taking short walks/ bus rides/ grabbing home alone. Plus i take afternoon naps regularly these days. Its just my way of relieving stress.

Yet, my boyfriend doesnt seem to fancy my change and so, our rs has been going through some rough times ever since he ORDed. He mentioned that he doesnt feel like he is being needed and that i dont love him as much. But everytime i see him, i still feel happy and blessed just that it tires me whenever i need to interact with ppl/ go out for long hours. Even for friends, im also not the one who jio people out, i just wait for them to jio me, but it doesnt affect our friendship in any way. I also havent made any friends in my 2 years of uni, all of them are hi bye. Cant seem to find the energy and motivation to interact with others. Im quite satisfied with my current social circle. Not sure if this is due to his enlistment, im used to spending time alone and only seeing him once a week, hence im fine with continuing this pattern. Ive spoken to him before and already gave in by spending more time (having dates after school, allowing him to fetch me after school etc) as i feel like some of his points were valid. But whenever he starts to doubt my love for him, i feel like ive committed a crime. 

I feel so helpless at times as i cant deny that i enjoy alone time but it my bf doednt accept this change in me. Sometimes i even wonder if i should continue this rs.

771,"My girlfriend cheated on me during her exchange, having sex with a random guy and travelling all over the continent with him all while I was deluded into thinking that she was focusing on her studies. I eventually found out but chose to forgive her after months of quarrels, and she seemed remorseful and eager to change for the better. 

Choosing to stay together with her was a ridiculously painful choice, like someone was constantly shoving shards of glass into my heart. Every new loving memory crafted with her was clouded by the painful remnants from being treated like a plaything. While doing mundane things like brushing my teeth or commuting on the train, my brain would suddenly be flooded with memories of what happened back then, and I would be overcome with emotion and just break down. A very sorry sight to see on the train indeed. 

My emotional health is in pieces... But I still love her. I really do. I believe that I am willing to die for her. There are moments when everything seem to be back to normal, back to the days before she indulged in adultery and we were just a young couple in love. The illusion fades away as quickly as it blossoms. These emotional scars will probably never fully heal as long as we are still together.

But yet I do not want to leave her. I know that I’ve been majorly cucked, but I do not want to leave her even though I am in so much pain. A war rages on inside me between logic and emotion. A pyrrhic victory is the only possible outcome.

Dear NUSWhispers, have any of you stayed together despite your partner cheating on you? How did you deal with it? Are you still happy now?

I feel like I’m slowly falling apart. All that will remain will be a sad, empty husk. Pitiful wisps left over from a foolish romantic who just wanted true love.

772,"I am a current NUS undergraduate dating an older, married man. Lets call him Jerry (Not his real name). I would like to take this opportunity to address some misconceptions that many people here on NUSWhispers have regarding girls in my situation. 

1. Love

I love Jerry. I really do. In an alternate universe where Jerry was a NUS student, I would hunt him down during orientation, hold his hands and never let go for the rest of my life. Jerry is kind, sweet, intelligent and wise. I love it that no matter what problem I may encounter in my daily life, I know I can count on Jerry to provide me with a fresh perspective and good solutions. Girls on NUSWhispers: Imagine having your own personal Prof Ben who is available 24/7 to answer any of your questions and do naughty stuff with you. Doesn't that sound super romantic?

2. Money

Ours is not a sugar relationship. When we met, I didn't know that he was rich: All I knew when we first met was that he was on vacation with a naggy wife who didn't know how to appreciate the historical significance of the place we were visiting, and I was likewise on vacation with an immature ex-bf who was married to his iphone games.  

Now let us address the elephant in the room: the issue of money. I have two confessions to make. First, I admit that I find successful men attractive. Second, I admit that while I do not receive any monthly allowance or credit cards, I do receive gifts of jewellery, clothes, handbags, etc. As a matter of principle, I never check the value of the gifts I am given. However, based on common sense, I would estimate their value to be no less than the equivalent of $5k monthly as quoted in the previous confession. 

However, before you judge me, consider this:

A. Self-made rich people tend to be smart, driven, attentive to detail and have nonzero communication skills. These are all extremely desirable traits in a boyfriend. At the very beginning, if I am to be brutally honest with myself, maybe I was indeed attracted by Jerry's money. However, as we spent more time together and slowly accumulated the usual emotional baggage present in every relationship, it is ultimately Jerry's personality, not his money, that keeps me devoted to him.

B. My ex receives a monthly allowance from his parents of approximately $500 a month, of which approximately $50-$100 is spent on me. Jerry's monthly remuneration is a six digit figure, so $5k a month is not unreasonable. In fact, if you do the math, I am probably slightly underpaid in this relationship... 

3. The wife problem

I am probably unique because I have actually seen and interacted with the wife before. Overall, I think that apart from her constant nagging and lack of cultural awareness, she seems reasonably attractive and any guy would be lucky to have her. I do not hate her, neither do I love her. Sometimes, when Jerry has to cancel on me due to some family appointment, a terrible rage boils up within me and I think of doing evil things to her. Yet, these moments of rage are balanced by the quiet, introspective moments in the middle of a boring lecture where I pity her for her ignorance and feel guilty for being the ""homewrecker"" in her marriage. 

To be honest, I am not really sure where our relationship is headed right now. I love Jerry very much and want to marry him sometime in the future, yet I don't really want to see his wife's large stupid eyes filling up with tears. I also don't really want to be a stepmother to their children. A few months ago, Jerry brought up the possibility of divorce and we discussed it seriously. Unfortunately, Jerry's wife got pregnant again so our plans are temporarily on hold. We have not discussed this issue since then. 

For now, my relationship with Jerry is my beautiful secret: neither my family nor my friends in NUS know about this. I love Jerry very much. Perhaps the OP of 68088 is right and the best thing for me to do in my situation is to screw society and enjoy the happiness that I found in an unexpected place...

I know that it was ended up with a very bad condition where I didn’t even talk to him at all. And I don’t know whether he is bi or what, but to be honest, there is no such friend would do extra miles like the normal couple did. But in the end, he never admit it to me at all.

Sometimes, the feeling of guilt dominates my thought where I am always feel that I disturb his time and breaching his space despite he is the one did it most of the time after the confession. But truthfully, there is no single anguish came out from him except for copious cursatives he said unto me which is normal to me.

I love being together with him and I don’t need him to do alot of extra miles for me, just being himself present in front of me should be enough. But now, his presence makes me more angry even though he was not in the same dept as mine since I transferred out, because for all the things that he did to me which was ended up so badly. 

Perhaps there is abit of anguish came out from my own self due to all the things that happened between us, but my love for him never fade. That is the one last thing I told him before I transferred out from my old dept, I told him that I loved him. I walked away with a heavy feelings, looking at his glistening eyes that tells his own unspeakable mixed reaction. He knows that I loved him and he did loved me but only as a good friend (or perhaps, he didn’t want to admit it to me).

780,"I have a story that I want to share. It is rather long, but I hope you guys have the patience to read it till the end. 

I met girl A when we were both penniless students in NUS. I was the nerd with thick glasses, and she was the happy-go-lucky girl with a smile always on her face. We studied together, ate together, went for lectures together. We were inseparable. We were soulmates. I would write poems for her, and she would feed me the cookies she made herself. After graduation, we decided that it was easier to write poems and bake cookies for each other if we lived together, and so we got married. 

Today, 10 years later, things are very different. The smiley-faced girl that I married now only has dollar signs in her eyes. I didn't know it when we were still dating in uni, but girl A is actually extremely stingy and mean. Girl A also spends most of her time causing trouble with other housewives and rarely spends time with me or the kids. In her free time, her favorite hobby is finding fault with me and starting unnecessary quarrels for no reason. There are no more poems or cookies. She claims that she dosen't have time to bake cookies, but I recently found out that she had the time to amass a secret stock portfolio bought using my money. Frankly speaking, if I had the wisdom to sign a prenup, I would have divorced her long ago.

I met girl B when I gave an invited talk at her school. She emailed me soon after for advice regarding uni choices for a future career in my line of work. At first, due to my bad experience with girl A, I assumed that girl B had dollar signs in her eyes as well and decided to just treat her as a casual fling. However, on our first night together, I was surprised that she showed up at the room with a teddy bear from home: Apparently, she was very attached to that bear and couldn't sleep without it. That was when I realized that she was actually a really kind and gentle girl, and all my fears and apprehensions melted away that night. After a few wonderful nights together, I became her teddy bear and she is now only willing to sleep with my arms around her. Till today, I sometimes get texts from her in the middle of the night, complaining that she has trouble falling asleep without me.

All the while, unlike girl A, girl B never once got into any arguments with me about money. When I brought girl B along with me for a business trip, I didn't want my secretary to know about our relationship, so I gave girl B her own supp card for her to handle the usual logistics. Based on my bad experience with girl A, I was expecting girl B to max out the card by the end of the trip. I was right: girl B did indeed max out the card, but she spent the money not on herself but on me: Apparently, she saw that my suit was old and worn out, so she secretly took my measurements while I was asleep and arranged for a new suit to be made. When we returned to Singapore, I trusted her and let her continue using the card. Even today, as the new NUS term begins, girl B continues to take time off her busy schedule to spend time with me, and we are creating wonderful memories together every day, every moment. 

Dear reader, if you are still with me, I have a confession to make: I am actually the author of post number 67924. Please be my judge: If you were in my shoes, which relationship would you cherish more: the relationship with girl A, or the relationship with girl B? Society seems to think that one of these relationships is more legitimate than the other, but as I drift off to sleep beside with a girl who hugs me the way she hugs her teddy bear, I imagine that maybe society is wrong for once and that happiness can be found in unexpected places.

By loving, you embrace the difference. By loving, you share your life with your partner. By loving, you complete each other. 

Love, is not about finding fault, but about finding common ground. It isn't about winning, but about seeing from different perspectives. The objective of love, is not to wear each other down, but to build each other up. 

Love, is when you are willing to give without expecting to take, willing to go the extra mile even when it's not needed.

I was abit weird that why would he spent his time on me as he himself got a gf. So i asked him direct “how are you and your gf?”

He said “we broke up already straight after we finished school”. And i was like “Damn!”

I didnt even know how to say but we went for a meal quite a lot, we went to watch movie quite frequent, not to forget the couple seat. I dun even know whether he liked me back or not but all he did to me is like someone the couple did. But I dont want to think alot about as I prefer the latter to initiate the move. So at one point of time during christmas, we were asking each other what we want for christmas and apparently he said he wants me for his christmas and suddenly he act cute after. I said to him to stop it because he is meddling with my feelings. 

In the end, i told him that i liked him and i loved him. And that is where all the awkwardness started. I started to avoid myself from him and started to stop texting to him. After that he started to contact me again and started to talk with me again. We do the same routine over and over again, without thinking on that day. He never said anything about the day i confessed to him because i dun want it affect our relationship at work. 

Months by months passed, our relationship worsen and we argued alot on the phone. I didnt even talked to him during work. Only after 2 years of knowing each other, we did a closure tgt which was failed miserably. In the he told me he dont like me and only treated me as a friend. And what kind of friend who called me up for hours and bring me for a meal secretly without ppl in our workplace knowing about it.

In the end, I ended up requested to transferred out from my old dept and move to the new one for the sake of my own self to be happy during work without presence of him. Honestly I gave up alot of things to make myself happy again. But out of all things, I would never forget what he told me after all he did: He dont like me because I am a guy too.

786,"I need some advice. I have a boyfriend of 4 years. Since we live together, I cook for him and occasionally help him with his homework. He also helps me with the dishes and stands up for me when I get bullied.

However, he is very unaffectionate and unromantic. We don’t go on dates often, or celebrate anniversaries or birthdays like normal couples do. Although we share the same bank account, he is willing to let me spend our money on things that I want. But, we hardly ever hug or kiss on a day to day basis, let alone have sex, which happens once a month on a good period, and up to once every 3 months on a normal period. 

We have only been together for 4 years, but it already feels like we have been together for ages, somewhat like an old couple. It has come to the point where i feel like we are like best friends rather than partners. And i wonder how marriage life would even be like with him. I’ve talked to him about this before but nothing much has changed since. What should I do?

788,"I am feeling so hurt and confused right now.

Some background: I bought a jumbo pack of condoms and put it in my GF's place. Usually, while waiting for her to shower up, I would manually count the number of remaining condoms to make sure that she isn't cheating on me. Usually, the numbers tally up. Sometimes there is a small discrepancy, but then again I am not a math major so I give her the benefit of the doubt. 

It has been two weeks since I last went to her place. Yesterday afternoon, I was shocked to find out that there were 6 condoms missing. This is not a small discrepancy. I don't know which feels worse: The thought that she did it with 6 guys 1 time each, or the thought that she did it with 1 guy 6 times. I feel so hurt and confused right now. Apart from this incident, the rest of our relationship seems relatively normal, although on hindsight there were maybe some other warning signs that I was too blur to catch.

Should I confront her about the missing condoms? Surely there can be no other explanation right...

789,"Why do girls think guys should make the first move, and if they don’t, get a stamp on the face smack center that “guys r really dumb- giving subtle hints like crazy also dun get it”? Do guys deserve such short sighted judgement, if you think of all the teasing sg gals pepper on guys? 

Consider the following scenarios. Tell me why this would mean it is a hint for the guy to confess since gal is interested. 

1. Gal chats with guy everyday. Have lunch, meet for movies and find nice places to eat. Meets on weekend, even goes to ECP. 
2. Gal drops by abruptly out of nowhere, say hi and infront of ppl she dunno, she suddently squeeze into the coffee table to do small chats with that guy only, literally kicks all other convo with his friend out of the window and it is all about her feelings, then abruptly say she buy and leaves - but after presentinf little gifts for him- but not handmade. Same Gal tell the guy lets go watch a movie together in front of everyone but takes 100 messages just to pin down a day for the movie, which turns into a breakfast lunch dinner movie time that gets cancelled several times with more apologies and more small gifts. 
3. Gal makes handmade cookies and gives guy regularly. Many times the cookies are heart shaped. She does not appear to cook specifically for the guy, but gives the impression she does. She seems not to realise that it is possible to peek into her bag when she takes out her cookies to see more cookies in there, nicely wrapped. 
4. Gal calls up guy for lunch almost every day, but cancels regularly, saying got this guy with Ferrari want to buy her lunch, but he keep canceling. 
5. Gal who regularly meet for lunch suddenly confides about how her finances are in trouble because an “unknown” sponsor only gives her $1,000 a month and she cannot afford to go on studying like that and was wondering if the guy can chip in another $1,000. 
6. Gal sees guy in a bus stop opposite, walk over just to say hi, small chats and even takes the bus to an MRT in the opposite direction saying she got time. But till now still haven’t exchanged numbers. 

Well let me tell you: NONE of these girls are dropping hints to start a relationship. They are just trying out stunts to see if they can elicit some kinda response from a guy, anywhere from “hey, can I meet you again” to “baby, I can’t stop time but I can stop you from leaving”, only to shove a power move called *WTF-blush-and-nevertalktomeagain-kthxbye,next* move. 

So what does guy do? “Well that was fun. Another time. Cheers!” ... and maybe she will msg again, maybe not. 

I know how this works because... not to be flexing but I always had girls lining up to pick from, but I know they are all just doing their 어장관리. I am fine with that. Having lunch with nicely dolled up gals is always a better deal than eating alone. 

Let me lazer in here for the guys on how to know yr gal got some feeling. 

Here is the thing: money talks. If a girls buys the meal, she is interested in you, and if u want to confess, she may or may not reject but she won’t do a ego trip on power play to hurt you, and the friendship can continue as if the confession did not happen (but dun ever confess again, although she will confess if she wants later on, maybe long after). Reason being that gals will NEVER spend money on a guy who they have zero feelings for. You cannot guilt trip a gal to spend money on you. She will spend money on you because she likes you. Maybe not enough to start a relationship possibly, but definitely enough to care for your ego being broken if you confess. If she writes love poem or make handmade origami with something written in it and lots of heart sign, that is not hint alr its confession hor, even if the content is only abt the weather or poem like “mice loves rice like I love u”. 

Ah yes, I forgot. If you don’t have girls lining up to have lunch with you, please ignore this post and study hard for level 1 pak-tor modules, this is level 4 module tips on choosing girl to BTO. 

Btw just to clear the air on getting a BTO: if u r from a really rich family, u will be forced to get a HDB by yr parents so as to learn to live humbly AND so that money does not poison their grand children or yr wife. So stop being so shallow and write off everyone in HDB as ppl who can’t afford condos. I could pay the downpayment for a condo just by saving up my allowance for a couple of months. Yeah I take bus 95 like the rest of you and don’t waste money on depreciating asset like cars even when I can afford an X5, because having money to burn does not mean you should burn it.

Hi, how are you?
Did our remembrance from the past has been completely fading away?
Cos part of me urging to hold firmly to that memory

I always admire your beauty from the first time we met
I always want to get closer to you 
Hoping to hold your hands,

However.....
I understand that you have found your one
To scribble your heart with an unforgottable love story.

Am I happy for you?
Is the question that I am unable to answer in the recent clock-ticking
Am I sad?
I don't know...

For the regretful past keep knocking at the door
The memory of those beautiful moments
While you still walking at my side
With that picturesque smile drawn on your face

Forgive me if I was ignorant
To the fact that I like you
Holding the forces of change
That enable my lips to utter gently onto your ears
""I like you, beautiful girl""

For the time being
Hope you are grateful for the ""one"" that you have been looking for
Hope he will create a wonderful memories in your love life

Last Monday at around noon, was at Novena Square2 Koufu foodcourt when I saw this cute girl around 160cm tall. Was starving so brushed it aside and went to buy lunch. My food was ready but couldn't find any empty seats except the table she was at, so asked her if she'd mind me joining. Good thing she didn't and I happily sat down diagonally opposite her (personal space right?) We were both minding our own business, but it felt like there's a spark when we exchanged glances. Wanted to strike up convo numerous times, but the shy me didn't muster enough courage for fear of embarrassment should she be attached. Sadly, she left while I was taking a call and missed the chance to get her number..

I (21F) was together with my boyfriend (should be 23 this year) for 4 years and its was his death anniversary 1 month ago. He died last year due to sleeping pills overdose. Yes, he had depression. He was a awesome listener and advisor (but sadly, not to himself), loyal, compassionate, caring, funny, etc, but one day, he started texted me a whole paragraph in an apologetic yet loving tone. And that was the day he died. I was devastated. His family was devasted, so were his friends. Although it has been a year, my heart aches whenever i think of it. He was my first and only boyfriend to date, but he died. I cried myself to sleep daily for about 3 months. Nope, i dont blame him for anything, he was an awesome boyfriend, but instead, blamed myself as i didnt notice anything weird and hence, unable to help him as he was struggling with school and sky high expectations from his parents. 

Up till this date, ive rejected 2 guys as im unable to open myself up, his death left a scar on me. So please, if you dont want to ruin or leave your boyfriend broken to pieces, dont ever suicide. Overcome your problems together. I know its sickening for people to always say seek professional help, but really, please do. If one doesnt suit you, try the next one. Dont be afraid nor give up. Be a warrior instead and im sure he will be proud of you. It is a blessing that he didnt give up on you. Fight this war together with him and both of you will turn out stronger.

I like modest girls and have only mostly dated girls who are the kind who save sex for after marriage and I'm fine with that. I don't think of them sexually or fantasize about having sex with them. The same problem happen with crushes, I do not have sexual attraction to the kind of girls that I develop crushes on.

However, I turn to porn and pictures and videos of girls in skimpy, slutty outfits that they wear to clubs and masturbate to them instead. When I see girls post images of them in revealing pictures of themselves in skimpy/slutty outfits on Instagram, I get turned on sexually but turned off emotionally. When I get to know a girl and find her Instagram, I will check if she posts those kind of pictures and if she does, I immediately lose interest in developing anything more than friendship. This also has to do with a bad past experience when I dated a girl that had those kind of pictures and I thought that ""she was special"" or ""this time its different"" but it turned out that I was thinking with my emotions and we ended up breaking up because of our different sexual beliefs and thoughts on modesty.

I do not want to date or have sex with just like that, they are just masturbation material to me. I wouldn't cheat on my girlfriend or wife but I will masturbate.

So, what if im the only one feeling awkward but the guy played along with my friends instead? This happened in JC and i actually regret pushing him away back then. But oh wells, it was partially because im confused with romantic feelings and i doubted myself, thinking that i aint pretty enough to have him as a bf. Just to give a brief overview, the guy in particular teased me sm even after shipping, drawing heart shapes on glass doors; requesting for pictures on special events (even told me to be more natural by holding his waist), etc. Oh i even heard from my friend that he asked if i liked him, but my friends said no so... yup.

In secondary school I got close to this guy and we started texting a lot. We would text all night till late and continue in school (either teasing each other in real life or texting). We talked for hours about anything and everthing. He was so sweet to me . We were best friends but tbh we were close to crossing the boundaries between friendship and bgr. I really like him and I think he did too. But things got downhill.

Everyone started shipping us and things got awkward in real life. Whenever we talk or seen together in real life, friends around us would ship. It got so bad that even our teachers knew and people from different classes knew about it as well. Gradually, our texts also got lesser and we slowly drifted. We were still close but not as close anymore. After a year we stopped talking completely. My friends would tell me to move on, but I couldn't. I think it has been around 4 years since we talked, but I am still not over him. I heard he got a girlfriend now while I'm a single pringle all this while. 
Maybe you will say that was my own fault for not taking the initiative etc. I did, but we got so awkward because of all the shipping that we would be so cautious in talking to each other and became distant.

*Potential trigger warning*

Babe, I'm sorry for all the pain I've caused you since the beginning of our relationship. I sincerely appreciate how loving and doting you are towards me and I love you lots too. I notice every little tiny yet significant effort you've put in for me and from the bottom of my heart, thank you so much. There isn't any problem with our love. There's no doubt that we love each other so much but, in this love, it doesn't bring you happiness.
I know I sound cliché like, "" It's not you, it's me"" or ""You'll be much happier without me."" but that is what I truly feel right now. Yes, it's selfish for me. I know that in a relationship, we are a team. We need to work together to make this relationship work. However, before I can fight together with you for this relationship to work, I've my own battles to fight. I'm struggling and I'm losing the battle. I've expressed my agony fighting with my depression, eating disorder and anxiety to you and it breaks me to see you being affected as you hear me speak. I understand that mental health might be much too complicated of a topic for you and I don't expect you to help me solve the problem. I mean, even I can't find the solution even after battling it with it for about 5 years now. On top of my inner struggles, my parents are f**ked up too. I know you hate them for not responding to my cries and constantly venting their anger and frustrations on me. Babe, thank you. Thank you for being angry for me. It really mean a lot to me, honestly. It make me feel this warm fuzzy feeling in my heart because you're the first person in my life that ever cared for me. However, like I said, it hurts me to see you being affected by my problems. Yes, I know that we're a couple, it's only normal for me to sympathize and be affected when I see you suffering but no. I mean, since young, I've been constantly being 'abused' by my parents and it's a norm. But for you, it's not so you're not used to it. And now that I'm also struggling with mental illnesses, the burden you are probably feeling is 10times more than it already was. Although I am barely functioning, I can still fake a smile. But, it's a ticking time bomb. Suicidal thoughts is also a norm for me. So, attempts are always going to happen. Yes, it's stupid, I hear you. I am clearly aware of all the possible consequences I might face. I'm sorry but sometimes it's not about what I know, sometimes the urges are just way too loud. Babe, I know you don't understand why the hell I am doing this but, when I start to feel suicidal or depressed or when I know I'm relapsing, I start to push you away not because I don't love you. In fact, it's quite the opposite actually. I love you too much to see you get hurt. I know I say a lot of nasty things to you when that happens but that is because I don't want you to get caught up in the midst of the chaos. You've gone through enough already and you should just take a break. I'm a mess and I don't want you to see me like this. Maybe after the break you'll love me lesser....? So if I killed myself, you'll be able to move on much quicker and easier as compared to if you're still as madly in love with me like I am. (Ah yes, comments, I can hear people's knuckles cracking already) I know it's f**ked up for me to think like this but honestly does anyone relate? Is this something like a normal feeling someone else feel too or am I just an alien? Cheh, just kidding haha... 
Babe, sometimes I wonder if your life would be much happier if I died. Like, you no longer have to worry about me anymore. Like, this burden (me) will no longer be there. 
Sometimes I wonder if you'll be much happier if your girlfriend is a much more of a normal one. 
Maybe I sound like I don't love you, but I do. I love you so much. You're the first and last person I think about every day. When I at the edge of killing myself, simply thinking about you makes my heart ache so much. I hate that I love you so much that you can stop me. But I can't live on being like this anymore. I want to end this endless, torturous, bl**dy agonizing life but time and time again you stopped me. Why? I'm sorry if I sound ungrateful but it hurts. This is a living hell, stop letting me breathe...Stop loving me. Stop giving me a reason. (Okay, okay, I can hear people screaming through their screens already. Sorry people.)
Many of you may suggest seeking professional help but personally it is not an option for me. 
1. I did seek help and they said that they will get back to me in 2 weeks time. (Great, totally useful with the fact that I almost had a full suicide attempt today.)
2. My parents is very traditional so mental health is not a thing. They always say ""why are you sad? You got things to be sad about meh?"" Or they will tell me stories of how much worser other people lives are which makes me feel even worse for feeling this way. So every time when I suggest that maybe I should find help, they will disagree and oppose the idea.
3. I am terrified of the hospital. As much as people tries to sugar coat about IMH or whatsoever, I have heard countless personal recounts about how horrid it actually is. So, god, no...
4. Medication side effects. Medication for mental health are extremely complicated and each individual requires different amount of dosage. Or, many medication just have side effects and they sometimes causes new symptoms to pop out. Personally, I hate medicine too so, double no no.
5. Costs. (I think this speaks for itself.)

818,"Long post ahead.. I will try to shorten as much as possible.

Got tgt w very first bf, still less than 3mths. We're deeply in love and.. We're virgins. Been on the topic of sex rather frequently nowadays. Naturally, he wanna see a pic of me which turns him on.

Basically, I can take a pretty good picture because my deepest, darkest secret is that.. I have played online sex game and even PM with a number of guys before.. Or, quite experienced in sexting, for short.

So, those guys have seen pictures of me before (I shall not be explicit to what kind of pictures but.. It's for sexting so.. pretty obvious what pics I've sent and received before?) but has never seen my face or know anything personal about me at all.  Ever since I met my bf, I became less active and eventually uninstalled both that game and the chat app which I used to do sexting.

Clearly.. My bf does not know about this dark secret of mine.. So, i'm just really worried if my bf asks me how did I manage to grasp the angle for the picture.. Should I tell him about this secret of mine?

I fully understand that there is a high chance of losing him especially since his impression of me is that I'm extremely shy when talking about sex. Which I truly do, since I have never been intimate with a guy in real life before.

Now that I think back.. I truly regret my actions. I felt lonely since no guy ever likes me back.. Those sexting made me feel loved in an intimate way. 

I have no idea what a guy will think of if they hear such stuff from their gf.. Actually, i'm prepared to carry this dark secret with me to my grave. But as time passes.. I felt more n more guilty about hiding such a secret from him. Yet, i'm extremely scared to lose him because he might think how ""easy"" I am and that he isn't the first man to see my body.. Though, in real life, he will be the first.

So the question is.. Should I be honest with him about this dark secret of mine..? We all have a past of our own, but this is not an excuse for my actions.. I should just bury away this part of me, right? Not even my friends and families know about this side of me. Serious advise please......... Right now, i'm more inclined towards hiding this all the way even though we both said not to have any secrets between each other.. (heavy sigh)

When i first met this girl (21F) through a mutual friend last semester and she always gives off this cold vibe, which im strangely attracted to it. We've went out quite a few times with a group of friends and although she has a straight face all the time, she will be a good listening ear and only speak when needed, which is what i like about her too. We are in the same telegram group too, but she also doesnt reply often. Whenever i walk past her in school, she doesnt even say hi, or show any form of acknowledgement. I know this probably means she is uninterested in me, but i really cannot forget the smiles she rarely has, she is really a beauty.

Its been a month since ive met her and ive already made a decision to chase her but idk how. Any tips for chasing these kind of ladies? I heard from my friend that she's been a victim of toxic ex just a few months back, hence she may not be that into rs now, so.... how should i even give her any assurance?

But the issue here is that, she is my first GF. I have never been close to any other girls before. Personality wise I am a little bit more passive and quiet. We are getting along ok just that sometime as she is the more experienced and aggresive one, she gets on my nerve sometimes. I am not sure if I should settle down and just accept this normal route.

I hear people saying to try out other people and all sorts of things before settling. 

Im confuse as to moving on and staying on this normal route with my first GF. I do not like this feeling that I am having. Its like FOMO but also I do not want to hurt anybody else. What should I do? Has anyone feel or experience this before? Should I just accept and move on?

822,"It makes me FURIOUS that many of my fellow babes don't know the secret weapon to attract guys.

I present to you: Johnson & Johnson Baby Powder. Dab some of it on yourself before going out. Use enough such that you can just barely smell the baby powder beneath whatever other products you may be using. Also consider carrying a small bottle of baby powder on your person so that you can apply more as necessary.  

Why is baby powder super effective? three reasons:

1. Baby powder smells good. Its scent is mild, neutral and inoffensive, complementing any feminine odors that you may produce. When accidents happen, baby powder is a girl's best friend. 

2. Baby powder is sexy. The scent of baby powder makes guys subconsciously think of babies, and all guys know how babies are made. Regardless of whether the your target is a horny schoolboy with an oedipus complex, a salaryman looking to start a family or a tiko uncle with an underage fetish, it is undeniable that baby powder has a mass appeal that is unrivaled by any other product. 

3. Baby powder has deniability. Things can get ugly if a girl smells another girl's perfume on her man. On the other hand, the smell of baby powder elicits a response of ""Wow, my man takes such good care of our kids. He is such a good husband and father"". 

Best of luck in the upcoming semester :) Just remember to use protection, otherwise the baby powder that you bought will end up being used for its original purpose.

824,"I met her two years ago at the start of uni. We ended up taking a few modules together and we grew closer. I hadn't had feelings for her then. We were just platonic friends.

One year in, I started developing feelings for her. I told myself I'll confess at the end of July 2018. Lo and behold, she got dumped recently in a relationship that lasted 8h, when the guy went back to his ex.

I postponed my confession, and decided to wait it out and be there for her. Till this year, she suddenly told me I was not her ""cai"", but still dateworthy

We went out for a few dates over the past few months, and just a month ago, she just dropped me altogether.

Looking back, I realise I was some kind of rebound. We frequently hung out in school , and especially so where her ex will appear and she will appear to be really enthusiastic with me, as if to spite her ex.

She also liked to complain about her ex to me. I thought it was normal since she was still hurt. Gradually, she initiated fewer and fewer conversations unless she needed someone to speak to, or she was bored, or had an anxiety attack. I begun to realise I was frequently left on read, being ghosted or outright ignored until she needed something out of me. I was stupid and continuously held on. 

I don't expect her to reciprocate romantic feelings. That would be unreasonable for me to demand of. 

What angered me was that, I was dropped altogether. When I pieces the puzzle pieces together, I realised that once she has recovered sufficiently, I was of no use to her. She gradually ""weaned"" herself off me. Bit by bit. And now it's the end. She doesn't initiate anymore. And I don't wish to disturb her peace. 

Hope you're happy C. And I hope it wasn't intentional.

I was in the closet throughout my 4 years in nus, and because of that, I never went into a relationship while I was schooling. Instead, I was constantly wondering why god made me gay and not allowing me to experience romantic love like everyone else does. It was tough and at times, depressing because you simply don't know how the future will pan out for you and if you will be single af till you die. (And not to mention I was from eng so the work load really CAN kill you) 

Long story short, eventually I came to terms with my own identity, and came out to my parents after I graduated. Lucky for me, and they are very accepting of it (thank god for them). Fast forward a few more years later (along with many painful crash and burns and important lessons), I finally found my other half on a dating app and entered my first serious relationship at the age of 30.

For all of you singletons out there. Don't worry if he or she has not appeared. Work on yourself first. Get fit. Read more. Be nice to people. Groom yourself. Along the way you may get your heart broken many many many times, but don't give up and know that all these tiny episodes will make you stronger, and a much worthier person for the right one later.

Yes I know the comments are going to talk about high demand for girls and Low supply of girls hence the high standards. Or like how girls have a lot more matches on tinder. Ok but what about in other countries? There isn’t really such high standards for guys and the dating scene is more ‘fair’, even though some girls overseas can be better than sg girls in almost every way.

829,"I had a relationship with a Malay guy, lasting for 5 years. He is 4 years older than me, knew him when I was 18. Before the relationship, he told me that it would be okay for me not converting if things get serious between us because he does have a cousin who married a Mongolian without having the wife to convert (civil marriage). His family would be okay with me. Therefore, we started the relationship.  

I am a free thinker so I was rather open to know about Islam during the relationship. 

So fast forward to the stage where we’re considering marriage as the next step, it became a concern when my family did not know anything about me and him.
I was very selfish to hide the relationship from my parents all the way.  Because it was really hard, knowing that a lot of things would possibly change within the family, I did not want to risk the peace of mind of my parents. 

Why? Because I noticed that he changed his mind. 
He started to drop hints, wanting me to convert after we got together for two years. I know it probably because he wanted to be serious with me, he gave me the reasons like our kids cannot keep his name as father name, I would go to the hell after death, his father would not approve our marriage, or I would teach the wrong things to his kids.  

I did seriously consider convert. The real deal-breaker is when he kept repeating that I have nothing to lose after converting because I am a free thinker, it should be easy. I was really saddened by this comment from him. He did not see things in my position at all. He did not know I might be ended up going home every day to have my parents asking me if I am sure about my relationship, or etc etc. 

Therefore, I had second thoughts. He was upset. In his eyes, I was just choosing Pork over him (he literally said that) despite me explain to him all my uncertainty and worries during that life-changing phase. I told him I needed his support and guidance on the decision and I wish he did, instead of being extremely defensive.

The relationship became ugly and unhealthy afterward, having both of us to challenge each other times to times. “Why you love me when I was not a Muslim, but insist to change me now?” “Why are you so religious when you are the one keep asking me for sex before marriage?” He even said that I did not give him my virginity as I did not see him as the one I would end up with. 

I have a close Muslim friend of mine once told me that I should never convert to Islam because of a man, it should be me myself want to. I remember going to the Islam Beginner course alone, which he didn’t even bother to accompany me there. When the instructor asked me where my partner is, that’s the moment that really strikes me. I am on my own, this is a decision for my own life, should not count on that man at all. 

It has been 2 years since I moved on from the relationship. After all, I thought I owe him an apology for hiding the relationship from my family for the whole five years, especially after reading the comments from the other post saying that there is no reason to hide a 5-year relationship. For me, it was not because of what but I felt that we were not sure where we heading, therefore I should not have my family being so worried about so many things unnecessarily. I am sorry. It was my selfish decision. 

Also, congrats on your wedding.

Sometimes I also just laughed it off when he shared some memes I can't quite relate to. We both have different personalities and I have learnt to accept them, but it seems like he still can't. He would often want me to become more extroverted, but is being introverted a bad thing? He always has this misconception that being introverted is equal to not being able to hold conversation with someone, and thus is bad. He always compared me to himself, claiming that he is able to converse with a diverse groups of people. But I am the one who have more 'real' friends and who go for outings with different groups of friends more often. He would say that he wished for a gf who is more ""crazy"", less awkward, and ofc more kinky. I love him a lot, and trust me, I have tried to change whatever that I can to suit him, but I find it really hard to be completely someone that he wishes me to be. If some of my personalities are bad, I will definitely try to change them. But what he wishes for is not an improvement to my personality, but a drastic change in traits. Do you agree on this? We both love each other a lot and we are committed (we always try to solve our arguments no matter what). He would often said that he was just tired and he didn't mean what he said. I believe him, but the fact that this issue keeps coming up in our arguments shows that he still can't accept my personalities fully and it still bothers him at times. I would like to seek an advice here on how he could better accept the difference in our traits. (Please no breakup comment, it's not an option for us. An elderly couple once said, ""If something was broken, we would fix it. Not just throw it away."" And that's how they managed to stay together for 65 years.

Have a bf of 3 years and bto already. We are in our 20s and he is younger than me. I always thought guys got higher sex drive one but somehow recently our sex life has been very pathetic like maybe 3 times a month kind of pathetic. Might be useful to note that we have been staying together for 2 years. Always kena reject when I ask for it but I've never rejected him one lor.

Tried talking about it but he claims its entirely normal for couples who have been tgt for awhile and its a common occurrence among his friends. But right, my ex bf who is older than me (we were tgt for more than 5 years) always wants to do it until sometimes I pretend to sleep to get out of it so I am very confused like what is normal? So I asked isit I'm not attractive to him anymore. Then he say I'm still attractive of course but attractive does not equate to sex. Don't sound right leh?

Recently I found he has the stupid telegram wtf and you know what that means la huh. It's like the new SBF but on steroids. He claims is normal but I can't help but feel hurt esp since it seems to have an adverse impact on our sex life. 

My q is - is this cause for concern or is this entirely normal? Is it possible to love someone but not want to be intimate with them like minimally once a week? Should I reconsider this rs cos haven't married alrd so jialat I think it will only go downhill from there?

I'm a casual gamergirl raised by a bunch of gamer brothers. You name it, I probably have played it at some point in my lifetime. CPU games like first person shooters- (Counterstrike was my favourite, I was pretty decent) to LAN gaming, to more casual gaming like with the gameboys and playstations (Nintendo is amazing), then moving on to more super casual online games like maple or gunbound (which were kinda meh, looking back). I am active on gaming forums on reddit and my life revolved around gaming, memes and studies.

You'd think with all my wisdom and knowledge that I would be attractive to most boys as I'm familiar with everything that reminds them of their childhood. I have dated a few guys but nothing too serious from these online games.
You and I thought so wrong.

A boy caught my eye in school and the feels were mutual. It was okay that we didn't have much in common but we talk for days on end, however my gaming past and present never really surfaced. And then the ultimatum came- I realised he didn't know anything about gaming. Like. Nothing. How can a guy of my generation not know of the existence of pokemon?! He didn't even know any other alternatives (Don't be too happy digimon fans, he doesn't know about you either), he doesn't know that Zelda is a girl, nor does he know or heard of final fantasy?! The frustrating list goes on for this boy who lived under a rock. He doesn't even have any mobile games on his phone.

I mean- he does have his own hobbies. He's into cars and bikes, and abit of sports and music when he was a kid, but still. How can?! For my own sanity, I managed to convince him to pick up a few indie games on Steam- to which he was meh. We meet halfway and we talk about music from games instead of the games themselves, which I guess are decent enough. Other than that, we have nothing much in common.

Despite his lack of gaming flair, he makes it up in other aspects. He loves his family and friends, he would give anything to see me happy. And likewise, I would grow to do so too. We are getting very serious in our relationship and he wants to settle down. 

I thought I knew what I wanted in life, as all girls do. Some handsome guy with similar interests and understandings etc. Maybe a guy that I could spar with in games and jest. But I was proven wrong again. I don't know how this universe entwines two people so different, that they can come together and discover love. I am just very thankful that I get to be a part of something bigger than myself. Perhaps certain things do not need explanation, because there is none to begin with; it just happens when you least expect it.

852,"I'm in a great relationship with a wonderful girl but the only thing that bothers me is that she frequently hangs out with her ex. Like once every 2 weeks or once a month. I know they broke up on good terms and agreed to remain good friends. She says that she has the right to hang out with whoever she wants to and that they are only platonic friends now. I can't help but feel insecure and jealous sometimes.

Guys and girls, is it possible to be platonic close friends with an ex?
I know there are 2 'camps' of thought for post-breakup:
1) Cut and block the person because they are now a thing of the past
2) Keep them as a friend because better a friend than a stranger?

There's a certain nostalgia and sadness that comes with knowing you tried your best. On one hand, it means it wouldn't have worked out no matter how much harder we tried. Shouldn't that make the parting you initiated easier? But on the other hand, you only give your best when you genuinely care for the other person and are willing to invest that much in the relationship. 

Time and space provides us an illusion of healing - but that's all it is, isn't it? An illusion. My emotions may be more settled now, but that's only due to the distance we've maintained. I can't imagine pulling off a conversation with you while maintaining my composure and calm demeanour. How does one truly heal?

Aiyo boys, hate to break it to you. People are attracted to looks first, then personality comes later. Why you all so angry against what is just basic biology? You all expect us to put on makeup, dress nicely, etc, but when a girl just says that she wants a man with a nice body, you all get so upset. Brother, less rage, more gym. If you want a girl who stays slim.

Being sexually attractive to your partner is a very important part about most relationships and yall are just gaslighting girls when you challenge them and ask them if they ""deserve it"". Let the market decide that, ok? Have you seen the Tinder stats? It's guys that have to fight harder, at least in the hetero market.

864,"All those recent posts about past relationships and maintaining contact with the exes makes me reflect upon my own dating history.
I broke up with my ex-girlfriend of almost 7 years because of a stupid reason. Eventually I realised that I was actually deeply in love with her and was a fool for giving up a gem like her. I tried to patch back but it was too late, she had moved on.
Fast forward to today, both of us have found someone else. She still treats me as a friend despite all I have done and tries to stay in touch and care for me as a friend. However, I do not feel the same way as I still harbour some feelings for her. I just buried them deep down in my being so that I could rebuild my life. You see, I spent almost 8 months in near despair and misery when she rejected me last year and I do not wish to return to that horrible emotional state.
Nevertheless, I will always reply her message and help her even if it is at my own expense. I will just lie to her and myself that I am doing it out of friendship when it is the furthest from the truth.  I will then hate myself for being this weak as I will always sink into a melancholic state once she stops replying. This is despite me constantly promising myself that I should find the strength to ignore her forever so that I may truly move on and rebuild my life.  
In conclusion, I sincerely believe that exes can never be friends or should stay in contact once they break up because there will always be one party who cannot move on despite the passage of time and space

865,"I feel like I'm losing my physical attraction towards my bf.. Back in NS, he was in NDU so he had a very lean bod (super firm pecs and defined 6 pack and all) and I'd be lying if I didn't get turned on my his physique. That was probably one of the major reasons why I looked forward to our 'quality time' on bed once he booked out.

We were still quite active just after he ORD-ed (finally no need to wait until wkend!) but less active once uni started since we are both in courses with demanding workload. During this time, he lost his lean physique. I understand that he'll probably never reach back to the peak he was in NDU due to school and club commitments, but his diet of Koi and salty, fattening food isn't helping his weight either.

Almost 2 years since his ORD, he has lost that 6 pack I used to love touching so much. Now, when I do feel his bod, it's less hard and firm, more flabby and soft. We still do have sex of course, but I find myself not getting turned on as much as I used to.

What am I to do? I'm afraid of telling him directly cause I know that he's very sensitive and it might hurt him and his ego. Yet, I'm not enjoying our lovemaking sessions as much as I used to. I used to initiate sex more often last time, but now, it's always him.

Some of you here are probably gonna tell me that I'm being superficial and demanding and all. Don't get me wrong. I still love my bf. He's the sweetest and most sincere guy I know. And I'm not demanding that he gets back to his peak physique either. Just kind of saddened that he has let himself go and is getting quite a bit of flab on his bod already. I can of course keep reminding myself of all his positive points like his personality. But when it really comes down to lovemaking on the bed, I can't exactly force myself to be physically turned on, can I?

There’s a particular day where I’m not feeling well, he drove down to find me, ensuring I was alright etc. Considering that was the first time we met in real. We both hit it off immediately. Phew. Glad there wasn’t any awkwardness. 

He will never fail to give me a call whenever he reach home after a day of work even though he’s tired. 

Usually he’s busy at work while I’m still studying. So I will text him w random details of my day and add on: “Reply after you end work/ whenever you are free ” 
I don’t get angry whenever he double ticked me, rather joyful that he actually squeezed out a little time off his hectic schedule to read my texts. 

After every date, he will offer to send me home. But I‘ll say: “ Don’t need , I go home myself you go home yourself , both reach home just nice about the same time! + You can rest earlier!” 

He kind of “pampered” me like a princess, although I always strive to treat him the same way as well. 

I’m touched by the little things he do - from asking how’s my day to ensuring I’m infront of him whenever we are taking the escalator. 

I’m a person who looks at sincerity, actions over sweet talks. So those little gestures really means a lot. 

We actually have a lot of things in common as well.

I think he also wants to take things slow, perhaps it’s better  to express myself here.

If he ever sees this:

“ I’ll cherish every second I have with you, be it good or bad , I’ll go through it with you, because you deserve it”  ❤️

We hung out a LOT (I mean lunch practically every day for weeks just the two of us, as well as working together in the same team and often helping each other out) and I think we've become good friends. He's quite attractive, but we always hung out on the basis of being just friends. So we'd even talk about who's attractive in the office, crushes etc. Now that the internship is over, I miss his company so much; but it is hard to ask him out to just hang out since it's just the two of us and we've no reason to meet up so soon after end of internship - and it is driving me nuts. I have never missed anyone's company to this extent; I am usually a very independent person and I enjoy being alone. But now I am so confused about my feelings; is it attraction, a crush, or just wanting to be in a relationship and pushing it onto the guy I'm closest to. Also since he's from NTU, meeting up during school term will be really difficult, but I can't imagine waiting til Winter break to catch up. I have not told him about this either since I think it would be unfair to push this on him before I sort out my own feelings. Then again, maybe I am overthinking because my mind is too free before the term starts, and all this will sort itself out once I am busy.

Should I be concerned?

Im just wondering if its right for me to get jealous when my girlfriend kisses her brother on his cheek frequently (her brother usually kiss her on the forehead too). She has an elder brother and sister and all 3 of them shower each other with lots of love by kisses and hugs. Although they dont do french kisses (duh), it just kind of bugs me when i sees it. She also hugs her male friends whenever they meet up. I understand that it may seem normal for her since she has been living in the states throughout her teenage years, hence im always being quite tolerant. Furthermore, she always let me know who she hangs out with and her male friends have gf too, so they definitely dont have any romantic feeling attatched. I just dont know how to disregard this jealousness in me and it would be selfish if i restrain her from doing all these.

Ive been rejecting a few meet ups recently after the the first 2, not because i dont like him, but i just dont understand why he likes me. I wouldnt say that im pretty and i have a hot temper. Being stubborn, willful and lazy are also my negative traits. Not to mention, im also quite childish (probably why he says im cute at times ????????‍♀️) and ive been very transparent with him about all this but he says he doesnt mind. Hence i always ask myself, who in the world would like to deal with a girl like me? Frankly, I dont understand what he sees in me or maybe im just not ready to be in a relationship. Its really stressing me out and i dont want him to waste all his time, effort and money in chasing me when there are plenty of better looking, better attitude and cuter girls out there.

906,"My boyfriend recently ORDed from NS - during those 2 years he had to stay in during the week and so we only were able spent weekend nights together. It was tough, but everything seemed fine. Now that he's a civilian once again, we spend more nights together during the week, but many nights he ends up watching TWICE (the K-pop group) videos for a long time before he goes to sleep (after our intimate time). He never used to do this during his weekend bookouts in NS, but I messaged one of his camp friends on the side recently and found out that he used to watch such videos in camp all the time. I'm fine with him being interested in K-pop for the music but it makes me really uncomfortable knowing that he spends so much time thinking about other girls. TWICE seems to make him really happy and I know he had periods of depression during NS, but he's back in the civilian world now and I'm not okay with this. How do I bring this up with him? Of course I can't say he's cheating because they are celebrities but it feels like he's emotionally in a different place when he watches those videos...

It was a busy period but I did my best to meet up with her over the weekends. Throughout tough times and long outfields, she was always the one in my mind, motivating myself to go through all the shit so that I could see her at the end of the week. However, after a month-long overseas trip, I came back to a very different her. She was very not into it and the replies she gave me were very 'dead' if y'all get what I mean. Long story short, we broke up shortly after that. I am asking this as she is currently a student in NUS and I just want to know what happens when girls enter university, because we were doing very well before university entered our relationship. I choose to believe that it is not another guy (although I'm not dismissing that possibility totally), but instead it is other factors.

I got to know this girl through playing mobile legends. At that time, i was sourcing for a squad or active players to play rank games together through facebook pages. She's an extrovert, in contrast to me, an introvert so i enjoyed her company alot. She's also very cheerful and very well liked by people around her.

We would meet up often under void decks or malls to play ML together. There were also late nights whereby we will discord and play till early morning. I started to develop feelings for her and I felt like we were already an item. She would report to me where she was going and call me when i am not online on Mobile Legends.

This continued for more than half a year when i finally felt i had the courage to express myself to her. I purposely MIA for the whole day so that she would call me. And, at around 1am, i finally got the call i was waiting for. I picked it up and told her how much i liked her and i wouldn't want to see her with any other guys.

Unlike any other love stories, she just said, i was nothing more than a ML friend that brought her to mythic. And that was how my world fell apart again.

Everyday i wake up in fear that idk today will be a day we grow closer or more distant. I don’t even know the closer we grow is a mirage or we really are closer. I don’t even know her feelings to me are borne out of guilt just because of how nicely I treated her or cause she pity me.

I’m guessing she’s probably confused too and i really want to give her time. But you see, I can only guess, but how can one not have doubts when he lives each day with her with only guesses? Sigh.

932,"I graduated from NUS a few years ago. Since then, I’d been sporadically reading NUSWhispers.

I just wanted to get some nostalgia off my chest.

Dating post-grad was not the easiest experience. I experienced a failed relationship, and also dabbled in a certain dating app. Online dating almost always resulted in either me not being interested, dying conversations, or ghost matches. One pleasant match I had 2 years ago has been appearing in my mind recently, and while we had established our distance in the “wish you all the best” way, I’d been hoping recently that we could meet randomly in a cafe one day (haha).

He was a rather charming guy I talked to 2 years ago, when I was a fresh grad and him, a final year student in a course that usually rivalled the course I studied in. We clicked really quickly, and had lots of playful banters, exchange of our daily lives, as well as fun, interesting and intellectual discussions of many different topics. I thought we were compatible in many ways, be it busy-ness (he could understand how busy I was, and vice versa), intellect, and how fascinated we were with each other’s area of expertise. I expressed that I was happy talking to him, and he did the same. He found me cute, and vice versa (although I never explicitly said that :P)

This continued for about a week before he began to shy away, but not forgetting to explain properly to me that it was because he felt tired and not ready yet to put himself out there after a recent break up. I was disappointed of course, but not bawling and all that crazy stuffs. I think I really did fancy him, maybe because of the happy conversations/times we had in that one week. Although to be honest, I had my own emotional baggages at that time as well.

2 years down the road, somehow he’s been appearing in my mind a lot. I guess when loneliness strikes, you will always yearn for that person who makes you really happy, and was effortless to keep up with. Perhaps people may say “hey this wasn’t even a real relationship”, considering we had not even met (missed opportunities earlier, and him shying away eventually), but all the memories still bring a smile to my face. If he was still available, I would seriously consider rekindling things, because at least for me I feel that my emotional baggages in the past have been relinquished.

I appreciate you reading this story till the end :) Like I said, I wanted to get this nostalgia off my chest. I’m in the midst of leisurely writing a script on Modern Dating, and having ideas of a web series like Wongfu Productions. If anyone is interested, please feel free to comment :)

looks wise generally foreign girls are way prettier than singaporean girls. Personality wise singaporean girls are known to be materialistic, entitled and not feminine so that’s not good too. Skills wise a lot of singaporean girls can’t cook or clean so guys have to do it for them.

935,"Hello everyone, year 2 student here and I just want to know what are girls looking for in a guy.

I’ve been actively looking for a relationship for a while now and honestly I’m quite tired of going through the cycle of the excitement in potentially finding a partner then getting disappointed. I think I'm decently attractive and decently good at socializing. I’m quite extroverted so I don't really have a problem getting to know others in a group or individually. I can hold platonic relationships with female friends so I think I've been respectful in the way I've interacted with girls. 

But for the girls I’ve been interested in I’ve had no luck. Some are not interested because of commitment issues, either not ready for one or just not really thinking about one. Some are just not sure what they’re looking for and just don’t seem too interested in finding one. Some seem ready but not interested in me as in they don't reciprocate to my advances which can be simple things like going out together alone. Either that or they are already attached.

Common advice is to be patient and wait for the right one or to love myself before loving others. I feel the first one is lazy? How can you know who you like if you don’t take the initiative to look? I don’t think the second one is an issue because the only reason I’m actively looking is because I finally think I’m deserving of another person’s affection.

So what am I doing wrong? I can’t help but notice that every girl I’ve been interested in before is either already attached or disinterested. So does that make me the problem? Obviously I can’t draw binary lines and say all girls are A or B, so does that mean I’m just unattractive? Am I not reading signs correctly? Am I just attracted to girls who don’t find a person like me attractive?

For that matter what are girls interested in? Obviously respect and loyalty are the bare minimum. A sense of humour, common interests and other interesting stories are good to have. I think I have some measure of all these things and yet I’m still at square one. 

I hope this post doesn’t come across as pretentious. This is an honest opinion I have of myself and I think I’m ready to get into a relationship but obviously reality isn’t matching the expectation. So what am I doing wrong?

Please give me some advice on this. Anything is appreciated. I don’t know what to do anymore.

We are both the same age in late 20s. Surprisingly she is still evergreen and never dated anyone in her life. Her parents want her to focus on studies during her school days. 

The problem is she is not local. She came from mainland and working in sg as an accountant. Her mom wants her to continue working in sg. She is not from a well-to-do family so the best choice is for her to stay in sg and settle down here. Her english is not very good so I always talk to her in chinese. After the second or third date I felt she has fallen for me. She asked me questions like do i mind if i have a sticky gf. During that time I was not ready or have convinced myself if a china girl is what i want as a partner and I dont want to lead her on. I still like her company as she look pretty even without any makeup but I just dont want things to be so fast. So I talk to her lesser and begin cold towards her hopefully she give me more time.

However I think she misunderstood and distanced away from me too. There was once she sounded really depressed. I prompted her isnt it time for her to find a suitable bf and get married soon. She told me that she cannot even take care of herself so she cannot afford to take care anyone else.

After this we stopped talking. It makes me feel really bad. I should not have started all this and hurt her. I think she is a rare gem just that there is a social stigma of guys who go for overseas girl means he cannot find local ones. I cannot convince myself that foreigners can be better than local ones.

943,"Hi everyone. So i met this girl last September through CCA and i got really interested in her. She’s a really nice and pure hearted girl. The thing is, i tend to get really quiet with her and i don’t really interact much with her much during CCA because i’m afraid it will be too obvious and things will get awkward. She doesn’t really talk to me much during CCA either. We don’t really text either (only about work related stuff) We will be stepping down soon and i’m wondering if it will be weird if after step down, i start texting her to talk about random personal stuff?

945,"Many years ago, one of my modules’ lab exam was rescheduled to an evening session which clashed with my gf’s birthday (we booked a special dinner). An added complication was that it was her first birthday in Singapore without any family members around. It was either I celebrate her birthday with her and get a reduced grade or she ‘celebrates’ alone while I may get a higher grade.

I was very inclined towards attending the lab session and she also said she’s ok to spend dinnertime alone. However, I decided to heck it and yolo by skipping the lab session and going for dinner with her instead. She was shocked and asked why. I told her, “In 10 years’ time, my grade won’t matter. You will.” 

Needless to say, I got a poorer grade for that module for skipping a lab exam without valid excuse. But boy, did it feel saccharine.

Fast forward 5 years later, we broke up.

Fast forward another 5 years (i.e. now), here I am clutching the rejection letter from a prestigious masters course and they cited my inadequate grades and pointed that module out in particular (it was a foundational module).

951,"I need some advice as I do not know what went wrong or what I should do.
Have been with my boyfriend for 1 year (also moved in with him).
Realized that communication issue getting worse and him getting lazier. E.g Certain issues like planning for a trip has all fell on me (thou I initiated to plan most of it, just need him to know and have a final discussion before booking any thing)
If we touched certain topics that require him to think or make decisions together he will shut off or postpone it... We have been holding off discussions and now if we need to have any decision, means I will be the one to plan ... It makes me so tired and unappreciated because he simply shuts off.

Also the more he avoid, the more persistent I get which results in a few arguments. 

Even in terms of intimacy he always reject me for months saying he is tired.... he seems uninterested in everything except food.

On the other hand, he shows acts of service thru small little gestures eg cover blanket for me at night, refilling my water bottle before I go work, tabao food for me etc.. 

What can I do? When I force an answer he say he is stress at work/money... Is there anything I can do? Is the relationship worth saving? Or am I over demanding...

952,"I've a girl in my course that I'm interested in, she's only about a year younger than me since she took a gap year to work for some industry exposure. I find her really cute and friendly and definitely just my type. So our fac is pretty small, and we're all pretty much looking at the same firms when we graduate anyway. Since techno closed down we've pretty much needed to go next door to engineering to have lunch and so along the way we strike up some good conversation and I definitely can see this going somewhere.

So problem is I've recently found out that a couple years back she hooked up and slept with a friend of mine a few times, I guess in the first semester of uni, since this friend of mine got attached the semester after that. It's not really the problem that he's in engineering and we run the risk of meeting or running into him, but I just can't get over the fact that she's slept with him.

I've narrowed down a couple of possibilities, since I guess I was really trying to work past this uneasy feeling; I really do like my friend and I get the vibe that she's open to us going further.

First one is just because I've heard from her directly that this friend of mine slept with her senior's(?) girlfriend when her senior was still dating her, and I guess it kinda seems like he's not a nice person? I mean he's my friend and all and we're pretty close, and this really sounds like something he'd do, in the past at least, I'm just rather uncomfortable with the thought that she was willing to bang someone like him? I mean, she wasn't even really good friends with him at the time, they just met up on tinder and after a couple of months of going out on and off she just decided to invite him over? I mean it's kinda obvious what he wants right? Not sure if this is it since I've kinda been okay with my friend's dating habits since a few years back, and he was pretty much commitment issues guy, he'd get close to some girl and get some action, and then suddenly as things got serious he'd get out. Not a problem to me tbh, just slightly unsettling to now be attracted to someone who's been with him.

So the other thing is my friend's really quite the experienced guy, I know a couple of (other) girls he's been with (obviously didn't ask my friend how he was) and though they might have a few things against him they do end up saying that he's really good in bed, and that he's bigger than average ( if you catch my drift ). So they were all pretty surprised since he wasn't a large guy, just your average Chinese dude, and at the time he did have quite the nice body, abs and defined muscles and all that. So I've not had much experience personally, but to be fair not everyone gets the opportunities my friend gets... and I guess since he's the only guy she's ever been with she might be expecting a bit more from me than I can give? Just worried I won't match up to her expectations...

As for my friend, I guess it seems like he's changed since then, and gotten attached pretty long term? I've got no hard feelings against the guy, and I think he's changed for the better personally. It's not so much that I don't like the idea of my female friend having been with him ( I mean I reaaaalllyy don't like it, like who would, man? ) more than not liking that she banged him when he was still a major commitment-phobe? I guess?

Something like I don't mind so much that she's banged my friend ( who's since changed ) but really mind that she banged him when he was still *that guy*.

And also I'm really worried that I won't be able to perform in the bedroom; I've done my required readings in this area, but really nothing comes close to actual practice and I don't have much of that... ( to be really honest nobody's said anything good about my skills there ) and I guess if you guys say I can always improve it's literally inevitable that I'll always be compared to him? Like she'll always hold him as the standard I'll need to meet and I don't like that. It's not a good first time if she's busy comparing me to him in a bad way...

Really need some advice here, I'm just a really really confused dude, and I'm damn sure I'll have to find some way to deal with this before sem starts because I just can't stop thinking about this....

955,"Dear NUSWhispers admin, I hope you could publish this anonymous rant of mine as I'm really at my wits end.

I'm a Computing alumnus and got married 2 years ago. We welcomed our first child in late April 2019 and although it's a great news for us, my wife and I been having a lot of arguments since. I'm currently working from home as a remote developer for a European company earning 4,000 euros (about 6000 sgd) a month while my wife works as a HR associate earning about $3,500 a month. We have been arguing about how to take care of the child after she go back to work in September. As an engineer, I lay out several solutions for her -

1. We hire a maid to take care of the child. Her reply: Too dangerous, maid might ill-treat her. Also, our HDB (4-room) too small for maid to stay in.
2. We get my parents to take care of the child. Her reply: The child will not grow up to know who's the parents. Furthermore, my parents stay in Bukit Batok while we stay in Punggol.
3. We get her parents to take care of the child. Her reply: Her parents still working, can't do it.
4. Either one of us quit our job and take care of the child full time. Her reply: If I quit my job, who's going to support our family? It will be selfish to ask her to quit her job.

She insist that since I work from home and have freedom to choose my working hours, I should be the one to take care of her. However, I disagree because even though I work from home, I still have to work the 8 hours that I was paid for. Another rant that I have is that she always use my salary to buy make-up, nice clothes for her to wear to work. Yes her male colleagues are going to enjoy how pretty she look every morning while I have to bear her sulking face at the end of each day, all paid for by my salary. Meanwhile, she give 50% of her salary to her parents while the rest goes to her daily commute and lunch.

She keep saying I'm selfish and an MCP for asking her to quit but fact is I will happily quit my job to take care of the baby at home (something which she conveniently disagree with). Is this the trend with many Singaporean couples? Do modern wives expect their husband to earn a living and still take care of the matters at home just because we can ""work from home""? I hope by posting this, more people who work from home can come out and teach me how you deal with this issue? When it's 1 vs 1, it's really hard to tell who's wrong anymore.

I’m currently serving my ns and have a place in NUS next year. . I’ve recently been using apps such as Tinder and a few others. My purpose is just to find some short term relationships or fwb or just go out on dates, as life in ns can be boring sometimes.

My problem is, I haven’t met any of them irl. They all usually ghost me or reject when I ask them out. I can’t really understand why. I tried to stick to light topics (e.g. school, hobbies, etc.) for some, and others I tried more mature/deep convo topics.  In the end, it’s the same result.

I know its stupid for me to do so but im just afraid that it will result in a huge mess in the future if i'd mistaken the feelings and actually accept his love.

Ive known him for 5 months, we do meet up alone and i sincerely do enjoy his company which provides a sense of security too.

961,"I'm a guy in my late 20's and up till last year, I have never been in a relationship, had female friends, kissed, held hands, hugged or slept with anyone. On the other hand, my girlfriend is in her early 20's, recent graduate but has been in at least 4 previous relationships (one each for sec. school and JC, 2 during uni) and ""slept with less than 10 guys total"". The longest of those relationships was implied to be around 1 year.

I thought she was unbelievably upfront when she declared her ""history"" towards the start of our relationship. Along with that, she also gave a short reason for each relationship why they weren't a match (seems legit: guy moved too fast, too controlling, cheated on her, too immature) and mentioned she doesn't believe in one night stands. I didn't go asking for this info btw (I try to shrug off any time a girl talks about ex's because I read that's the macho/alpha thing to do or something), she volunteered it when our flirting went to ""why are you single now and want me"".

I was raised in a traditional family and many of my close friends are either single forever alones, or been in one long relationship since JC and about to marry. So I am clueless what is the average number of partners the typical 20's guy/girl should be in. However, IMO those numbers seem a bit high for someone so young and given my age, I'm worried if our relationship will be different from those and can actually last. Also I have no way of verifying how real those numbers are but also don't want to keep asking my gf on her past. What do you all think?

966,"To #65849...as a guy talking to this girl consistently for 2 years and being on the receiving end of something similar that you are doing now, I'd say please communicate, especially if you would like to still keep the friendship.

My own story is that, we were normal friends during the first year, but I started developing feelings for her during y1s2. But during the summer between y1 and y2, she had a rs that lasted only a few days before her bf broke up with her and went to his ex. At the same time I lost someone very important to me, and we somehow bonded over the pain. 

We were talking daily, and almost meeting each other more than once a week. I held on to my feelings, waiting for her to recover and get over her pain, before wanting to attempt anything because I don't want to open her old wounds. y2s1 passed uneventfully, this is 3rd sem we took the same language module together. I wanted to be with her, supporting her and be there for her when she feels down. We still chatted and texted daily. 

Cue y2s2, the sem that just went by. I felt that we got closer, we did more things together, even stayed up together to look at stars in utown. So many meetups etc. But still then I wasn't sure if she was over and recovered. One day I asked about it, and then she said she is open if someone asks. But a few days later she told me that I'm not her type. Well okay I understand that, maybe if I try harder things would change. 

I made a horrible mistake that I know I cannot be forgiven for. I lied to her when she texted and asked me who I liked. I said I liked someone else, after she pressured me to say it over 3 days. I didn't want to confess over text. I want to tell her personally. Face to face. I know I basically destroyed any chances with her like that. 

3 weeks later (yep I rmb things very well), the inconsistent communication began. Leaving unread messages, double blue ticks... I was bewildered. But I thought, maybe she's just busy. Okay. Yet she hung out so frequently with me. Dinners. Telling me strange things like ""you'd have a girlfriend now if you said something"". What am I supposed to think ? Mixed signals ? Her giving advice ? Or are those her hints ?. 

Now in the summer holidays, after going out a few times, things were ok until the last one. She just stopped replying altogether. Perhaps I should have confessed my feelings. But I can't create the right feeling or setting for it, I don't want her to feel uncomfortable when I'm saying those words. 

My question now is, do you still want the friendship ? If yes ask him out, and don't hint about broaching the topic, just say it straight. He will appreciate the straightforwardness. Sometimes we guys are just damn confused. We sometimes ask ourselves how do we win over her ? And then we learn that oh it must be 2 way, then we realise oh shit we're screwed it's been so one way. 5m later we ask ourselves again, shit I'm a guy I need to do more. On this end we also wonder how to preserve this friendship. We're all 20+, we can't be that childish and wreck a proper friendship just because we're having bad communication. 

If you're interested in him, or was interested, I feel that you should tell him too. Yes it would become a what could have been situation, or that he still has feelings for you. But HELP EACH OTHER. 

If you don't want the friendship, we will appreciate it to get a lengthy text message. At least we know that it's over. Sometimes such things keep us up at night, or we even cry ourselves to sleep. Maybe it's just me. But please at least say something. Because on this side, sometimes seeing the blue tick or the unread message, we will interpret it as you don't want to be disturbed by us. Take it that you're doing a good deed and re-initiate.

I am currently dating my 3 years boyfriend. He was my first that I dated with . He was a very helpful guy and everyone in my family really love him. As he is currently studying and have to support himself. We would spend most of our time together at home and eat at both our houses. 

We do not usually argue often. For me, I used to think that whoever is in the fault have to apologise and resolve the matter together. However, his approach would be to pretend nothing happen and continue talking to me. I tried several times telling him but to no avail. And slowly I got used to it.

For all our anniversaries, I would always be the one initiating, hinting him that the date is nearer. I told him that sometimes I would like to get surprise but he told me that he always wanted to every year but is busy studying or resting (playing games). I told him that I wished he could just dress up for me on special occassions like I do for him (I do buy clothings for him and he said it was too hot to wear) And he would wear out of my nagginess and are mostly always late for our dates. I would always be sad but told myself it doesnt matter as long as we enjoy our days together. 

I do understand that he doesnt often eat out like I do. So as I am working, I would often treat him to buffets/nice restaurants. However, he would complaint the food is not worth the money and sacrastically told me that there is nothing for him to eat and would rather starve. There was this time, I couldnt bear this and almost burst into tears. Even though he saw, but he choose to kept quiet and let me calm down instead, not addressing the issue.

We have also discussed our future marriage plans. But turn out that he have differnt ideas from me. I tried to address the issues but he will always get angry and stated that I was too stubborn to listen to him. And just demanded to go home as it was late.

I have been considering to break up with him after realising our different opinion in many issues, especially marriage, but couldnt bear to as I love him alot. 

Should I still be with him?

Basically I took the liberty of not replying anymore one day because I didn't see the how our relationship could get further. We had many clashes in personality and character, sometimes he doesn't even listen to me explain my rationale. And that really showed me that it's not going to be possible between us. 

And since the conversation on text with him daily was kind of dying, with surface topics and very obligated replies, I didn't see the need for something like that to continue. I also didn't want things to drag on since I already knew it wasn't going anywhere. 

But when I explain this to my friends, they tell me that I'm mean for ghosting on him. Well, to be honest, I do feel a little guilty and bad for doing that. But how else was I supposed to make it clear that I wanted this to stop? 

It's not like we were dating or anything. We just met a few times outside of school, kind of like dates I guess. But nothing was said explicitly about our relationship, being friendship or more than that. 

So now I'm just a little at loss of what to do. Should I speak to him about why I stopped replying or should I just leave it and trust that he'll get over it one day?

976,"I am a straight female, but I'm also a tomboy. I'm wondering if this is affecting my chances with guys.

I love shopping for tops in the men's department and find that the designs there are usually a lot cooler. I hate that tops nowadays for women are either way too short with an exposed midriff or just plain uncomfortable. Ruffles, lace and the sort of frilly nonsense just annoys me. I wear t shirts almost all the time (mostly men's tees) and short sleeved button ups for more formal occasion (also mostly from the mens section). I am afraid of getting judged by people around me so I shop online most of the time. 

I have a grand total of one dress - reserved for weddings and formal occasions with a strict dress code. I hate wearing dresses and skirts - I kinda feel very exposed and vulnerable. 
For bottoms I wear mostly jeans and trousers. Short shorts are just so uncomfortable to me. 

I don't know how to do make up and I'm not interested in anything make up related. I wash my face and that's about it. I have long hair - I like having long hair but I don't do anything fancy with it. I wear zero accessories. 

My mother says ill never get married because I don't doll myself up like everyone else. I have resigned myself to being alone forever. Am I sending the wrong signals to the opposite sex? I just don't wanna be someone I'm not. I can't find anyone to relate to. Should I just give up? It's just so lonely over here.

977,"Op of #64933 here

TLDR of #64933: I fell in love with one of my best friends, who is happily attached. Our personalities, interests and even food preferences matched like lock and key, we never ran out of things to talk about, and I feel she totally understands me. Because of this, I wanted to draw the line, and maintain the friendship, but failed and ended up crossing the line multiple times. In the end, I decided to ghost her, and cut her out completely from my life because I felt it was the best for both of us.

Recently, I found out from one of our mutual friends that she broke up. From this friend's account, she was very affected by the ghosting, and got into a fight with her boyfriend because of this. Apparently, she developed feelings for me too.

When I heard about this, I was mildy delighted (cmon, we are all selfish people). At the same time, I was consumed with guilt. Firstly for being the 3rd party in a relationship. Secondly for cutting her out so abruptly and causing her stress. Previously, the right choice was obvious. Now that the situation has changed, I really don't know what to do anymore.

Any genuine advice would be appreciated.

However, she said she did not see a future between us because she was 5’10” and I was only 5’6”. 

Well, obviously I was quite annoyed even though I was half-expecting this (our social standing is rather different, and I admit my own lack of self-development and confident played a big role, besides my height, or in this case my lack thereof) because I thought her personality should have been quite cool and that she wouldn’t be so fixated on our height difference.

While I now realise this was just an excuse she was giving and she wasn’t really so shallow as to reject someone purely on the basis of height, I couldn’t restrain myself at the time and angrily asked her, “What the hell? You’re rejecting me just because you are a bit taller than me? Don’t be so bloody full of yourself! You’re only 4 inches taller than me! 4 inches is so bloody short it might as well be nothing! 4 INCHES IS NOTHING!!!!”

After I said that, I was a bit disappointed with myself for having been slightly less composed than I should have been instead of taking rejecting in a calm and mature fashion, and got into a mood that can only be characterised by an overwhelming feeling of disgust and self-loathing. But the more I think about it, in the love context, while 4 inches is actually a negligible height gap, it can also be a reasonable length? Now I have conflicting thoughts on this matter...

What is your opinion, fellow denizens of NUSWhispers? Is 4 inches #perfectlyfine ?

To make things more complicated, she was also my best friend and we were very close. About a month ago i told her that i liked her. I didn't ask her out just told her I liked her. It seemed to catch her off guard. And nothing happened, she didn't really react then, she didn't say she liked me back or anything. Nor did she say she didn't like me.  I assumed she needed time to think about it. 

But since then, it feels like she has been avoiding me. Before this we used to hang out almost everyday day but we haven't met in a while. She won't even reply texts for a long time now. She doesn't seem at all enthusiastic about even meeting me anymore. Is it possible she is avoiding me because she'd rather this whole thing just go away without her having to deal with it?

The reason I took so long to tell her that I liked her was because i feared that if she rejected me i would lose her completely, as a friend and all. I fear now that worst case scenario may have happeneed. 
So what do i do? 

It seems like she doesn't like me but I can't even ask her since she hardly replies texts or answers calls now.  Or could she jsut be very busy. I don't know. From being that close to hardly communicating anymore, it's a big change.

1024,"Hi, I've been dating my boyfriend for a couple years now. And while I'm quite certain this is the man I want to marry, I have to confess I've never been fully satisfied in the bedroom before. 

I find it hard to tell him straight because I know it'd hurt his feelings. 

Before you ask, I'll just say that I've suggested things to him before and told him I'd like it if he surprised me sometimes or that it'd be nice if we tried some new things. 

I've never compared him to anyone, although I have offhandedly mentioned about my friend's sex life without thinking too much. 
 
It's frustrating because I have my own needs too, but I really love him and I'm afraid this will cause me to start looking outside of the relationship for sexual satisfaction. 

Can anyone please help me?

1025,"Hey guys I need a little advice, it concerns my girlfriend, my friends and my gaming.

My friends and I have been gaming together for a while now, and my girlfriend is also a gamer, but she was gaming before we got together. After we got together, she joined my group of friends and I in our ""static"" group (so we play together as a fixed group of people to do raids and stuff together).

However, we are different from other fairytales. I am not a tank and she is not my healer, we are both damage classes (DPS). I want to start off by stating that she is a good player. She is decent with her rotations and cooldowns, and she is also well geared. However, strangely, her output DPS is never anywhere near top level. On paper, she does around half the damage than our top DPS does. Ironically, she has the class with the highest sheet DPS. I have tried practising with her many times but I cannot teach her the awareness of when to use what procs and how to time other stuff.

I am the raid leader so I am usually the one monitoring the DPS meters, and there has been a growing unhappiness due to the lack of raid DPS. We managed to clear all the end-game content, but we barely did so before the end of the season. We have really struggled a lot. However, a new season is upon us and some of my friends are considering leaving to form a new static group. My girlfriend does not know this, of course. Like she knows that her DPS is lower than is expected but not to the extent that it is dragging us down with our progression. We all love gaming and I hope that this group can stay together, however it looks increasingly difficult because she refuses to learn other classes as she is only familiar and only willing to be familiar with this one.

Looking ahead, I am even considering just quitting gaming just so I can get out of this conundrum (whether my friends leave, or if we continue together but there is continuous unhappiness). Appreciate any advice going forward.

P.S. B I hope that if you read this, you know that I am not giving up on you, but it's because I want all this to continue

Her response: ""WHY ARE YOU SO JUDGEMENTAL""


IMO girls should date short guys cause
1. He probably won't cheat on you
2. You don't have to worry about him cheating on you
3. He probably can outlive you. Tall guys are said to die younger (I'm not kidding. If you don't believe me, feel free to do your own research)
4. He is probably the most romantic guy ever
5. He will make sure that you're happier than him.
6. His junk is probably 20CM long and thick AF????. You never try, you never know.(Probably can last for more than 30 minutes or even longer)
7. More importantly girls, you will be his world.  

So girls please give us short guys a chance. Love is love. If your love is superficial, you will end up breaking up; or worst a divorce. Ignore what you see on TV and social norms.

1035,"Hey everyone, a recent NUS graduate here who's only a few months in my first job and I have something to get off my chest:/

My workplace is a pretty quiet place; I look at four walls around me and talking to people does require a lot of self-initiative on my own part. For the first few months, I thought I was the only new employee before this fellow recent graduate (let's call her X) joined my department. 

My first few meals with X were pretty okay, though I noticed that she's the quiet kind and she isn't a really good texter. Some of the topics that we talked about really struck me deeply on a personal note, but she hasn't been the easiest person to have a conversation with; these conversations not being the smoothest in all honesty. However, I've been struck deeply by her kindness towards strangers (she very often gives money to the old uncles and aunties on wheelchairs without taking their tissue packets without any hesitation) and her own uniqueness and quirkiness; she's a really interesting character and she drew my attention.

The birthday card she gave me a month after, threw me into this deep state of confusion. I'd not received such a card for years; heck, none of my good friends would even consider writing a card for me at all. Despite it being a very simple card with some cute drawings, I was really touched and became extremely keen to know her better on a deeper note. However, she's been very blunt in her refusals when I asked her out at the end of the week on several occasions. It doesn't help that she almost never, never replies me on any sort of chat platform and that we occupy different rooms (her workspace concept is different). And on the few (and fewer) occasions when we actually have lunch, we speak and talk even less. It's incredibly frustrating as a colleague and as a person who wants to know X better; she seems to be now living in her own world and I feel quite torn apart as to what I should do next. She might not be intending this, but I feel that we're becoming strangers, again.

I have to add that I perennially feel bad too; was I too pushy, did I screw up my communications with her, did I talk way too much again and again, and did I make her feel uncomfortable at times? I'm a sucker at communicating anyway:( Having thought that she's at the same lifestage as I am, I thought that we could've built a deeper relationship with each other beyond just mere colleagues. But it's so frustrating when she's not the best in social situations (and awareness even) and that I just don't get her. I can't understand her, yet I still want to and yearn to know her better at a deeper level.

I'm so confused with X, terribly, terribly confused. What's wrong with me, and I wonder, why do I even bother? Am I still screwing up these sort of situations? I don't know anymore, perhaps I'm just wasting my time after all. To X, if you ever figure out who this is and what I'm saying, I just wanted to say that your fellow new colleague here isn't the best in talking either and that he just wants to be on the same wavelength as you.

But I guess, I'll just press F to pay respects to myself.

Oh well :( just wanted to get it off my chest. *shrugs*

1039,"To #65268
I can relate to how you are feeling. I, too, became a person that I'd despise during my pursuit of an impossible (in retrospect) relationship.

The greatest regret I made was thinking that I could change myself to become better and worthy of her. I did everything to make amends, to make things better, to change whatever that was a problem to her. As I've realised by this point, my naive motivation was wrong. I should become a better me for myself, and respect this lady's choice at the end whether this ""new me"" is someone she'd be interested in.

Not gonna go into detail but basically it was a horrible experience. This experienced had caused so much pain and trauma to a point that I had to seek professional psychiatry help to curb my suicidal thoughts. I'm at a way better position psychologically and mentally now but remnants of this past still haunts me. I get into this momentary state of anxiety and panic attacks when I encounter someone with a similar back view, until I take a closer look to make sure that it's not the same person. I happened to be in the same place with this person by chance at an event and I had to immediately dismiss myself after a while because I had difficulty breathing and started to become dizzy upon the sight of her.

The pain is real, the self loathe is very damaging to your body and mental health. Please do seek professional help if you need it. It's going to take some time to find yourself, but just trust that this experience helps you find who you truly are; your values, your mindfulness and what you stand for. It helps make you grow into a better person. It takes some time to heal from it but know what, don’t rush it. I don’t ever want to see that person ever again, not because I hate her but because I don’t think I’m ready to face that person yet at my current mental state. All that said, I’m grateful for this person for breaking me down, to give me a chance to build myself back up bit by bit, and understanding myself better. 

All the best to you OP of #65268, grow to become a better, kinder and more person. And I’m sure someone right would step into your life at some point, but make sure you’re ready for her. :)

1. I didn't get cheated on; neither did I wore the green beret. The content was hastily written, hence i didn't proofread what i have wrote.

Long story short, prior to us (my girl and I) being together, she was with another guy. They dated for 3-4 months, and from what I know, it was her first love. She trusted him and decided to do it with him. She let him enter the kingdom and wreck chaos resulting in her losing her virginity to a scum which left her shortly after..... When I heard from her very own mouth that she isn't a virgin, I was furious.

Anyway shd disclosed her status while I told her how some mammals are able to mate with just one partner for life.


I had this thought that I would be her first and probably her last....hais

 Yes, if you were to ask me, I was devastated when she said that she is not a virgin. I tried to be positive and told myself is okay......

Then I asked, ""Did the two of you used condom while doing it?"" She said no. This is where my frustration, anger, and anguish popped. Like what the hell you guys didn't even use a condom, and you even let the guy came inside you like a tsunami.  

We used to discuss about getting maried and having kids, but after hearing what she said, I don't think that's gonna happen anytime soon. I can't see myself sliding my dick into her kingdom which has already been splashed. If my smaller head goes in, it will feel as though her ex is taking a piss at my smaller head..........

To all those who suggested hymen reconstruction does it come with cleaning services? Like will the doctor clean her wall? ......... No right....

As much as I hate the fact that she is not a virgin and she let someone came inside her, I still love her.......

Meeting her is probably the best thing ever; but i doubt making love and producing a kid will be the same..... 

To all the girls out there, if you want to lose your virginity and let someone splash inside you, make damn sure that the guy is the one who will be with you till the end of the world. Otherwise, at the very least, use a damn condom.


As of now, I am seriously lost.

Was told by some of my friends about a post circulating on NUSWhispers which bears high resemblance to my situation. I believe the OP of #64974 and #65116 is my ex fiancé. I just want to share my side of the story.

Yes, it’s true that my ex fiancé got a pay rise recently and that ended up with her pay being higher than mine. But what happened was after her pay rise, I saw a side of her that I never noticed before. She became arrogant, controlling, and bossy. She acted like a know it all. She treated me as if I was a beggar who needed her to feed me. When we’re out with our friends, she acted as if she was the boss and I was her subordinate. When you’re treated like her subordinate when in reality you’re not, how can you not lose face?

Now that I’ve seen her post on NUSWhispers, i can be even more certain that I made the right decision to call off the wedding. I saw one of her posts which called me childish. Well let me say she is the real childish one. Why is she so childish that she has to go onto such an anonymous forum to rant, instead of communicating directly with me? If my future wife is this type of person who will stab me the back and complain about everything we disagree on by ranting anonymously online, then of course I would call off the wedding!

If anyone wants to say that I’ve drooped to as low as her by posting this post anonymously online, let me say to them this: I myself am only commenting here because I want to give everyone here the other side of the story.

I didn’t know what to make of it at that point of time; were they just merely joking/toying with each other or what? I was so upset that I cried and left her house immediately, citing that I had urgent work to attend to. 

Till now I have not confronted her about this as I don’t want to start a big fight again. I 100% certain that colleague of hers is hitting on her and I don’t believe she is oblivious to this. I really love her a lot (we have been together for 7 years) and I don’t want to lose her at all, but the red flags are so obvious. 

I am having sleepless nights and crying alone a few times a day because of this, help me.

Just wanna say I don’t mean to be cheating or left and right arm one girl. I did know my Best Friend way longer than my gf. Because I only have brothers in my family, I don’t know how it feels like to have sisters and I don’t know how to differentiate from familial love and romantic love. How do I tell the two apart? 

Also, my gf is the one for me, I just don’t want what I’m feeling for my Best Friend to get in the way of how I treat my gf. I really love my gf a lot. I just trying not to over generalise affection and separate familial love and romantic love. 
Or is it really possible to love two people at once? I’m not a cheater or player I promise u. I’m just a confused individual trying to sort his feelings out and figuring out what is right or wrong.

1077,"I started ghosting one of my best friends. 

We met in January this year collaborating on an event project, and her personality, capability and reliability immediately drew my attention. After the project concluded, we stayed in contact. Our personalities, interests and even food preferences matched like lock and key. We never ran out of things to talk about. We grew close very quickly. Even though I barely knew her for half a year, it felt like I've known her since forever. I genuinely thought she's the one for me then, and was determined to go for it.

But then I found out, she's happily attached. I was devastated. Still, I told myself to calm down. As long as I drew the line, I can still keep her as a friend, which I genuinely want to, because it is really difficult to find someone who totally understands you. So I sorted out my emotions, and continued as if nothing was wrong, reminding myself to not cross that line. 

Despite this, I crossed the line time and time again. As much as I can tell, she either didn't notice, or pretended not to know. However, our mutual friends definitely noticed. They talked to me, warned me not to play with fire. After some struggles, I decided that something needs to be done. I did the only thing that I thought was the best for both of us. I stopped contacting her. I stopped replying her messages. I disconnected with her on social media. I ghosted her. 

As much as I want her to know how much she meant to me, I can't. Because nothing good will happen if she knows. I really thank her for the past few months, for those are really the happiest moments of my life. I know whatever I'm doing now is not the most mature thing to do, but I don't know how else to manage this. I tried to draw the line, but end up crossing it again and again. In some sense, I brought this on myself. 

The most difficult part of this, is cutting out someone from your life, when that person has only made your life better, and nothing else.

I lived in sg until I was 11, went to the states and finished high school before coming back to serve NS. Honestly, having lived in another country for 7 years, I can say that there is merit to what he's saying with regard to the interactions and reactions you get when starting a conversation with a local girl. Although the examples given by OP generalised scenarios that lean toward the extreme, there are plenty of instances where a subdued versions widely occur. I.e. girls thinking that they are an object of interest when they aren't. Maybe most of you can't contrast the typical local girl with another who lives abroad so there's no comparison to be drawn, but ask anyone who has lived in a foreign country to tell you the difference. In general, local girls do give themselves more credit when it's due when it comes to their self-image in a bid to seem more desirable.

So I met her during an overseas internship. It’s been about 2 months since summer started. Initially she was quite quiet & shy as we are in a group. However, I slowly managed to make her to be more out-going, etc. She now makes fun of me quite often (using the jokes I used on her for instance), asking me stuff, etc. There were a few touchy moments but during a normal talk during dinner, she said she’s not emotionally ready for a relationship. Yet, there is mixed signals I am receiving as she treats me differently as compared to the rest in the group. At the same time, she actually asked me whether I wanna know her cousin from the same school & was trying to matchmake me with other girls in the office in a joking manner.

It is just so hard to get matches since the gender ratio and activeness is so skewed that I realized getting 1 match per week is already considered a lot. I chatted with my friends that also using dating apps and realize not getting any match in months is totally normal. And those guys are not even unattractive type with some of them eventually able to get girl friend in real life. 

Even after getting matches, many of them are not even responsive to your messages and you really have to be really good or lucky to get them out in real life. So far I was only able to get 2 of them out out of the 20-30 matches (excluding clearly catfish profiles). I think most girls on those app are deeply suspicious of those apps too. One of the girl that I asked out tell me she thought I am some kind of player of be on those app.

Really unless you are so desperate that you are willing to accept girls a few league below you, dating apps probably will not work for you at least if you are like me who is not willing to spend any money to unlock helping features. But then again even if you are desperate enough unless you are considerably attractive already, you will not even be get any girls out in real life to begin with.

1102,"It is difficult for the majority of guys using dating apps to find a girlfriend. In the past 1 year, I have gone on average 2-3 dates a month in hope to find a suitable partner and probably after seeing some 30 girls or so (you lose count after a while) and much effort, I finally met the girl I want to be with. 

Through the dating apps (Tinder and CMB), I end up going out with 1 in 10-15 of my matches. There is always a higher likelihood for replies on CMB as compared to Tinder. I probably matched with some 300-500 girls in the entire year and I initiate conversations about 30-40% of the time. What I found helps with my matches is, deleting your account once in a while and restarting all over, it gives you the mini boost at the start. Nice photos are important and I did pay for their premium services once or twice, it does help but often I find it not worth it. As a guy you’re either the cute or hot kind, find your niche, ask your female friends. Nice is a bad sign.

The dates. Most girls won’t go to the next date for whatever reason they might have. Persistence dosen’t work much because at any point they are talking to 2-3 guys at a time.  I was getting a lot of rejections at the start and the middle and I struggled to figure out why. It was only after I started gymming and bulking up did the matches want to continue going out with me. Looks matter a lot. I also realized that driving makes a huge difference. Girls who I drove home, actually all of them, would agree to go on the next date. All would start to reciprocate my interest after they see the car. Sad but true.
Above all, be genuine. The right one will appreciate it. Success is the right time and opportunity.

Avoid girls who just broke up and wanting to know more people. Waste time only.

I did reject some towards the end after finding what works for me. Use whatever advantage and experience you have, you’ll need it.

Ultimately, don’t give up. It is very very very difficult out there for the non top 5% of guys. You will feel like shit, hate yourself, but at the end, worth it. 

For those not getting matches, try elsewhere. My gf was 1 in the 300-500 of my matches. 1 in the 30+ dates. And i admit, I am picky so it took longer.

Good luck!

I feel quite bothered because I feel like even though he doesn’t have to show me off on social media, he could at least post a simple photo with me to show that he’s proud to have me as his Girlfriend.

I have talked to him about this multiple times. The first time I told him about it, he explained that he doesn’t want people to know about his private life and that he’s “uncomfortable” about it. But after talking things out, he promised me he would post something. Up until now, he hasn’t posted anything of us. And it’s been almost half a year since he made that promise.

So I asked about it again, and we have had this talk for at least 3 or 4 times. Each time ending up with him being really resistant in posting, saying that if he’s posting a picture it’s because I pressurized him to, and that hurts me because its just a simple thing do to.. why is it so hard for him m? I can’t help but feel like he doesn’t want people to know I’m his gf, or that he is ashamed of me. It makes me feel like he’s being so secretive about me on his social media and it makes me so, so uncomfortable and bothered :’( 
Every time after that conversation, both of us will be upset. And now I am afraid of bringing up this topic because I don’t want to bicker with him over this small topic, and also because I don’t want to force him to do something he doesn’t want to. But this issue is always at the back of my mind - why is he soooo against posting?

I know deep inside it’s more important how he shows his love in real life - and he’s been great really. His parents and close friends know about me. But I can’t still get over why he’s showing such extreme resistance to posting pictures of us on social media? 

1. Do you think his reasoning makes sense? That he doesn’t want to show his private life on social media? (He posts pictures of himself and friends on IG)
2. Am I being too insecure and making a mountain out of a mole hill? Should I not let this issue bother me anymore and let it slowly become a non-issue?

I guess priorities usually change for everyone as they grow older, after getting into different stages of life. But I guess the best I can do is to wish her all the best for her future. 

I'm always the one comforting friends after a breakup, telling them time will heal their wounds and to delete stuff related to their ex but damn! It's easier said than done. It's already the 3rd night and I still haven't got over this shit. It's so difficult to delete all those pictures and texts. And why the heck are chinese songs so relatable? What should i do???

1114,"So I finally texted a girl who's been my classmate for the past few semesters and has done a few projects with me and well, it wasn't exactly clear if I really liked her or anything, but I definitely felt like she and I were pretty close friends. And because it's important to clarify in 2019, yes I am a straight guy, and as far as I know, she is a straight girl. 

So we watched a movie; we have pretty similar movie tastes. But the current movies are just horrible. The new MIB has overused jokes, even if the guy is somewhat more stupid than normal (it is rather refreshing to see Thor being stupid) but the plot was weak and overall the chemistry was not fantastic. 

After the movie we discussed it over a nice dinner at Astons - nothing too fancy since we were just going out as friends. But one thing led to another and of course the question was asked. 

""Wait, isn't this kind of like a date?""

I tried to play it cool but it was probably wrong because when I replied ""well yea it is kind of like the 14th of June"" she got mad and stopped talking to me. She usually did not mind such jokes so I was very shocked. I asked her what was wrong and she just glared at me. We ate quietly for the rest of the dinner and afterwards I asked if she just wanted to chill and grab desserts. She simply rolled her eyes and nodded. I thought this was a good sign. 

Bought some ice cream to share and we still had our cold war. Yup, we fought over who would get more chocolate and who would get more matcha. Is matcha really a thing with girls because I like it a lot but not THAT much. So then she asked me something pretty similar, but probably more subtle so that I would not be able to reply in such an infuriating manner. 

""So, why did you ask me out alone?""

I really wanted to reply with a joke since that's what I would proably do, but that chocolate ice cream had an effect on me. The brain freeze probably made it impossible to think of a good joke. I told her that she's a close friend and honestly we were very alike and I appreciated that. Perhaps its a good time to say we were both wearing a white top with denim jeans. So of course I had to tell her we were a matcha made in heaven. And of course...

she smiled. I bet you guys didn't see that one coming. So everything turned out well and we said goodbye. We promised to meet each other again another time. Don't really understand why my replies worked sometimes and why they don't on other times... is it the quality? the timing?

I met her at a party hosted by her cousin, also a friend of mine, weeks ago. Mingled around and realised her charming smile and bubbly personality accentuated her good looks despite the crowd. 

Slid into her dm the next day, which was when our convo officially started. She began teasing me of my age and even lied to me in a joking manner whenever I wanted to know more about her, but clarified the next time i dmed her. We discussed about bgr/ her ideal type and she mentioned that she’d rather let things happen naturally and joked if i had anyone to intro. Reason why i ain’t sure she likes me is bc she doesn’t initiate convo/texts even if she always replies real quick. Asked my friend about her but she says it’s her usual and she may just be treating me as an older brother. I’m in a dilemma.

1119,"OP of #64396 here.
Thank you all for the kind comments, lovely people we have here.

I know a lot of you were saying that if she was a true friend she would have kept it to herself and probably bring it to her grave instead of putting me in such a position. Well for 1, I would have done the exact same thing if I were in her shoes - and I think most people would as well (just like the countless confessions here who die die must confess to the guy/girl regardless, because we don't want to live with the regret of not saying how we truly felt). 
And when she told me about how she felt, she said (paraphrased): ""I just wanted to get it off my chest, I know saying all these now wouldn't change a thing because of how committed a person you are and I'm not asking you to leave her nor am I expecting anything in return, I just wanted a form of closure on my end, to tell you and know that we're impossible."" She was right about the commitment part, I'm never the kind to waver. But idk why when it comes to this close friend of mine... ok fine I do know why. 

To those that say it is supposed to be easy just cut ties and choose your partner, I really hope you never ever find yourselves in such a position. And to those that asked who do I love or who do I want to spend the rest of my life with, honestly I can't choose because I'd be equally happy and contented with either (oh and to the one asking which is prettier, it's the close friend but I'm not going to be swayed by that) 

Anyway, doubt anything drastic will happen, I'm not going to leave my partner for her because if she knew, she will be guilt ridden for the rest of her life thinking she broke us up. But what I'm going to do is to tell my partner about this because I don't want to be guilty about hiding things.

Oh side note, partner doesn't know that close friend and I had a thing in the past, I mean technically we didn't get attached so I mean you don't tell your partner about all the 'could have beens' right. So when she first met this friend she did always wondered and asked me why I never chased her or why we never got together because we were such a great fit, she pretty, knows you well, got chemistry etc. But at that point of time we had alr moved on (she had a partner too then) so we just said like we were platonic af.
So with this, do I still tell my partner everything?? I mean sometimes part of maintaining a relationship is that you keep certain things to yourself right. Yeah need help here with the filtering.

Tldr; uh just read everything, and read the previous one too if you didnt

With that visibility comes much extra work, which seasonally becomes all-consuming. The past month has been as such, worked day and night without even much sleep.

I have talked to my gf of 2yrs about my busy schedule, and she has said it's okay and all. (she does fixed office hours) But about a week ago, I realised she is texting some other guy(s). Even when I do make time (like a full day) for us, like no work no phone just us, she continues to text him/them while together with me. I confronted, she's like ""an old friend"" ""yea, a guy"" ""he texts me on and off"" ""talking bout another old friend"", but I noticed the conversation can go on for days. We fought a bit, and decided we'll put this convo off till next month

So really an open ended question. What's going on, and any advice for the next convo?
(I'm particularly interested in the ladies' POV)

(fyi, I am not in Investment banking, and neither in sales. My busyness entails crunching numbers (analytics), and the occasional dinner with colleagues. No KTV or entertaining customer etc)

1135,"I finally found words to describe my past relationship, and I wonder if anyone relates to me?

I met a guy 3 years back, he was really very sweet with his words, I felt smitten. I thought he had potential and decided to dive into a relationship. It wasn’t smooth. He clubbed a lot while I don’t. Quarrels, fights and misunderstanding happened within the 1st month we got together. Things went very ugly one fine Saturday night, about 1 month into our relationship. He slept with another girl he met from the club.  He blamed it on me that I caused him to cheat (I admit I wasn’t a good gf), and he blamed the alcohol. I was extremely hurt about the blame, and I decided to call it quits.

He tried to salvage the relationship. He put in 100% effort trying to win me back. He changed 180 degrees, quit clubbing all together and he did his best to reassure me. And me, being emotionally weak, got back together with him, against all my friends advices, and without thinking properly. I wasn’t prepared to work things out with him again. 

Cheating may have scarred the victim and cause immense pain (I cried almost every other day after I got back together with him, and I felt so conflicted). What most people don’t know about cheating is that the cheating hurts the cheater the most. I became a monster. He was my punching bag. He gave me the permission to judge him, to abuse him emotionally and verbally, to manipulate him, to be always angry and bitter at him, to always suspect him for attempting to cheat again. All these just because he cheated. He was very guilty, and the perpetual look of grief in my eyes pained him all the time. 

Even after I initiated a break up yet again, he wanted to be there for me, and kept saying that there will be no other guy who would do as much as he did for me, and no one else will be able to tolerate me. It wasn’t a clean break up and we were both left dangling. Since the break up until early this year (about two years plus), I struggled with forgiveness, still felt bitter, and I kept thinking there will be no other guy who will treat me as good as my ex. I was going in a viscous cycle. Every time I met up with guys on the dating app and if I didn’t feel the same attraction as I did with my ex, I always felt like going back to my ex, as I thought there are no one else better than my ex. I would text him again and then get bitter at both myself and my ex. At one point of time, I gave up on the dating app, and I doubted I would find myself a partner as good as my ex.

It was only recently that I decided to start afresh. To make a conscious effort to not be reminded of my ex and his mistakes, and of all the regrets. Few months after my commitment, I met a wonderful guy on one of the dating apps. I didn’t have any expectations of him at all, due to my failed experience. But he is so damn sweet in action. While we have only just started hanging out as friends, he opens doors for me (even the car door). He surprises me with food at my house or at school. Whenever we go out to trek or to café hop, he will never fail to prepare a tumbler of water for me in his car, to keep me hydrated, as I tend to fall sick easily. He has even baked a cake for my birthday. I didn’t know that true gentleman existed! Do Singaporean guys still do this?

Tl;dr: 

If cheating was ever on any of you guys and girls’ mind, please don’t do it. It will hurt the person you love and it will hurt the cheater even more. And don’t settle. You deserve better. There is someone out there who will treat you the way you deserve. Happy Sunday folks! :)

1142,"Today, I passed by that post office in the foreign city again.

We met in our faculty's freshmen orientation camp. I was smitten by you. When the semester started, I tried all means and ways to get closer to you and know you better. Engineering multiple tutorial swaps to be in the same tutorials as you... finding ways to talk to you in between classes... inviting you to events etc. It was always one step forward but two steps backward. You would always engage in polite conversation with me until it turns slightly personal, then you would stonewall me.

However, I noticed that you would never stonewall me when you needed help with homework. My friends called me a ""doormat"" and a ""weakling"" for entertaining your requests for help. Alas, my fondness for you prevented me from drawing a line in the sand.

When it was time for overseas exchange, I was elated that we were going to neighbouring countries. It meant more chances to travel together and get to know each other better. So I thought. Those chances never materialised, but the occasional requests for homework help still flowed. I had promised to send you memorabilia and souvenirs from the country I was in. That was why I ended up in that post office in the foreign city sending a parcel containing memorabilia and souvenirs to you.

When we returned to Singapore, nothing changed. Even inviting you to attend a community service event with me did little to change the status quo. It was then I decided that maybe it was time to love myself a bit more and let others a chance to enter my heart. When we graduated, I thought our conversations would die a natural death since we were heading into different industries. Little did I know that Fate would deal yet another ironic twist. A few months after graduation, you told me that you are changing jobs, and your new job is in the same industry as mine.

Needless to say, questions about work sheathed in polite conversations continued to flow till this very day. Yet, after all this time, I have already extinguished any hope of being together with you. On hindsight, It would have been easier for me to move on if you found a partner, but your single status all these while meant that moving on has to come intrinsically from me, not extrinsically from your unavailability.

Today, I passed by that post office in the foreign city again. Unlike the previous time, I have my significant other at my side this time round. I took the chance to let others enter my heart, and I don't regret taking that chance. 

As I wrote this piece, I received yet another message from you. I have little doubt that it will be another question about work. Maybe, just maybe, I will delay my reply slightly this time round.

1143,"I’m a foreigner girl, currently dating a singaporean boy. When we first started dating, I often asked him whether he was sure about us, specifically about me being non-singaporean. I actually felt inferior to singaporean girls because it is actually more troublesome to date foreigners: citizenship, job prospects and most importantly, housing matters aka BTO. I felt bad that we cannot just straightaway apply for a house solely because i’m a foreigner. 

But thankfully, he assured me that nationality wasn’t really a consideration, especially among others - our personalities, our chemistry, our common experiences, and our relationship approaches. And I guess that’s how relationship should work, instead of merely comparing the over-generalised traits between singaporean girls and foreigner girls.

And also, to clarify some of the generalisations about foreigner girls which are more wrong than right: 1) myself and many of my friends are from cities, not villages. 2) I don’t have 9 siblings, 2 kids are more than enough to my parents. 3) i didn’t choose singapore, singapore chose me first. 4) i feel really bad if i ever have to rely on him for citizenship so i do hope i can somehow obtain it with my own efforts. 5) i don’t think i’m better any singaporean girls, neither do i think that anyone deserves any rights to look down on or cast ill-informed judgement on others, whether singaporeans or foreigners.

Why is it so common for girls to initiate to break up when their boyfriend is in army or when the girl is on exchange? 

Yes I know that both will have little time for each other and are in different phrases in life so they won’t have a common topic. And this better and richer guy will appear and get close to the girl, being there for her instead of the boyfriend when she needs someone. Despite all these, I think if the girl genuinely loves her boyfriend, she will continue to be with him. Sadly a lot of girls still want to break up when the guy is in army / girlfriend is on exchange.

1151,"Ditto to #63686. I think the materialistic, self-serving attitudes of some (definitely not all!) Singaporean women drive us men to look overseas. I've dated locals who stayed for years but bailed the moment things got tough and the future prospects I initially seemed on track to materialising fell into uncertainty. 

I'm now married to a Polish woman, who accepted me despite knowing I have multiple sclerosis (which was what made my previous ex leave), and despite my continued inability to pronounce her nearly vowel-less last name. To further shatter the notion that only poor foreign women from second-/third-world countries would readily accept any half-decent Singaporean guy for money or citizenship, my wife came from a well-to-do family. She left behind her life of relative luxury to come here and slog it out with me. She also has a masters degree while I only have my 2.1 bachelors; nonetheless, she's planning to put her career on hold to take care of our kids, or to be the sole breadwinner if my currently mild MS takes a turn for the worse. 

Antagonism is never far away when a relationship/love is contingent on material expectations. In fact, i'd say it's better to not have expectations beyond those about character, personality etc. Basically, love somebody for who they are, not what they can or cannot achieve. Unconditional love, far from making both parties lazy and unmotivated, might actually drive them to achieve and provide for each other. I certainly feel that way. I'm more motivated now to work hard and provide for my wife and future kids than I ever was when I was alone, or in past relationships where I was pressured with expectations. 

P.S. for the fellow introverts who are wondering how we met, it was on Chatroulette which is probably the unlikeliest of places to meet your other half. And no I wasn't flashing my junk. :)

1152,"What does it mean when a guy stops initiating text? 
I’ve been hanging out with this guy for a few months now, I even confessed and he reciprocates but we decide to keep things casual since none of us can afford a rls at the moment (I need to focus on my studies oversea and he needs to focus on his career). Things were fine for a while but now he stops initiating texts and we basically haven’t talked for almost half a month. I initiated a couple of times before we temporarily stop talking, he replied pretty quickly and still showed enthusiasm, but I don’t want to do that anymore for fear of bothering him and he’s just too nice to tell me straight in the face.
FYI he’s still pretty active on my social media, still likes my pics and sees my snaps so he can’t be too busy to stay in touch. 
Does this mean he doesn’t like me anymore or is he trying to avoid me? I’m so confused.

I used to think that i should wait for the guy to initiate a convo, but i soon realised that i should make some effort myself if i really wanted something to work out. So i did try to start convos once i matched with someone, but i almost never get a reply back from those. 

I’ve never been in a relationship before neither have i tried these kinda dating apps, so i just wanted to know if this is normal? And also, when guys like someone, do they actually really think of the other party as a possible catch or like they’re just liking to see if they’ll get liked back or what?

I know for myself that I’m a below average girl so I’m not expecting to get many likes, but if someone liked me, I’d expect that the other party is actually interested to get to know me? Yet somehow conversations dont even happen. I’m so confused.

1154,"This is to all the girls having high expectations of their current/future boyfriends out there.

From a genuinely curious male, what do you girls bring to the table in your relationships (that will actually benefit the male) to warrant such high expectations?

Education? Guys have similar education standards, so what makes you so special? Conversely, if you lack education, why would higher educated guys settle for you?

Financial Independence? Then back up your words by paying for 50% of the house and car. There is no functional difference in a wife that earns 2k or 10k a month if she refuses to spend a cent on things that both parties share.

Taking care of the child and cooking? Monthly maid payments are less than 1k last I checked. 

Please don't mention companionship as we all know that is a 2 way street. 

If you demand so much from the male, be prepared for him to demand the same things from you as well. We want to be boyfriends, not sugar daddies. Males can be generous, but we absolutely dislike relationships on unequal terms where we feel like we are getting taken advantage of.

We are all for gender equality, but please remember that equal rights begets equal responsibilities.

1155,"Aiyah actually all the latest confessions about love can be summed up very simply. The girl in that recent post that got really popular was wrong on many things: incessantly looking down on foreign girls, equating love with money, wanting to be the man's equal (or better) in the relationship but refusing to pay an equal amount, etc. But she did get one thing very very right.

""you are what you attract"". (Not ""you are what you hope you attract"", which she conflates the two -- that's called wishful thinking. I have Scarlett Johansson/10 years ago Joanne Peh standards, means I am them meh? Maybe only my mom would think so.) Go look it up - there are studies that show that people by and large go for their general matches. Socioeconomic match, looks-wise match in particular. Of course you can trade some in either direction but as a rule of thumb not even a billion dollars will turn you from Quasimodo into Li Nanxing (unless you go do surgery lah, but that's a topic for another time. This one not thesis.)

So, long story short, all this debate is not very useful. No amount of hand wringing will challenge the primal human need to preserve social status. If you want rich and hot, better be rich and hot. Otherwise, good luck, no matter how much you insist on high standards, it's not likely going to happen. If you want just hot, you also need to be hot. If you want just rich, you also usually need to be rich (maybe the most flexible one, but still - think about the rich couples you know, and the proportion of them that are actually socioeconomically lopsided.)

Or maybe, just maybe ........... you realize that finding a real life partner to love and to have goes above and beyond these things. That you don't need either of these things to have a loving and happy relationship. 

If you want loving and understanding and supportive and committed, be loving and understanding and supportive and committed. That's the real ""you are want you attract"". It's the most important one. And happily, it's also the one attainable by everyone.

1161,"When I think of Singaporean girls, I let out a really big *SIGH*. 

When you’re in your teens things were much simpler. It was about spending time together and having that naive dream of being together forever. 

As we age and move into the working world, expectations change and it is no longer about who loves us most but what the other party can give. 

I’ve been on multiple dates overtime and I tell you that girls look out for financial, social, emotional, physical and spiritual aspects when choosing a partner. You can pour your heart out for them but they’ll just ignore you and think it’s normal for a guy to do so. Fall short and you’ll be axed from their list. 

The decent looking ones, they have options and they’ll move on quickly just like that without a blink of an eye. In the age of online dating, girls cycle through guys faster then ever.

To be a Singaporean guy, the expectations are high. The more educated and successful the girl, the harder it gets. Yes there are exceptions but rare and already taken. 

The silver lining comes when the girl was too choosy or not lucky enough to find a suitable partner by 30. There’s a mad rush to settle. Meanwhile those in their mid twenties? They’ll just have fun while waiting.

I’ve heard multiple times how foreign girls are easier to please. It’s true. Our girls are materialistic.

Hence, for the guys that have good gf or wife, hang on tight. For those who live through the demands, endure well!

My Wife and I are openly shameless to one another. Even before we were married and were just starting out. We would always joke and discuss about everything and anything including the serious topics like cheating, sex, gender equality, who pay and what not,

e.g. If she paid I would call her my sugar mummy and if I paid she called me sugar daddy and we laugh it off. 

e.g. When she went to shop for her lingerie she would ask me to come along haha, her reason is so I can choose and learn how to remove later haha. It was quite embarrassing at the shop... So I brought her along when I went to shop for my undies and told her it was for the same reason haha and we both laughed it off.

Honestly if you are already in a BGR, all these sensitive topics are the most important CONVERSATIONs YOU NEED TO HAVE and actually they are easy to start and keep going as every one has their own opinions and you need to have these conversation early on so you won't waste each other's time if you two just ain't a good match for one another.

1164,"In the recent debate about dating foreign girls, the thing is just like anyone from any country, there are going to be pros and cons. Its really just about your personal preferences. Being the level 99 love guru that I am, let me break it down for you kids.

Dating a singaporean girl
pros:

-she probably earns as much as you do, and she has cpf as well. So she can pay 50-50% for your HDB or your future kid's university fees. 

-contrary to popular belief, sg girls are really not that materialistic. They earn as much as you and can pay for their own stuff really. If you are dating a Siam Bu, you will need to give her $1k per month for her grandmother's neighbor's dog's hospital bills or something.

cons:

-after watching too much Disney films when she was a kid, too much Korean dramas in her teens. Worse of all, being spoiled rotten by her parents, she expects to be treated like a princess. Sg girl: why you dont go Jewel tabao A&W at 1am to my house for me when i hungry? you dont love me anymore right?!

-she cant cook or clean to save her life. Guys if you cant afford a maid, then you ARE the maid.

Dating a singaporean boy
pros:

-he probably earns as much as you do, and he has cpf as well. So he can pay 50-50% for your HDB or your future kid's university fees. If you are lucky maybe someday he will be rich, if not well at least you wont be poor.

-Sg mothers taught their sons well. He will not insult or physically hurt you. You will be surprised that some foreign men think its normal to abuse women. 

cons:

-Childish and immature. Similar to sg girls, sg boys are sheltered by their parents until the point they cant even plan a decent overseas trip themselves. All they seem to be good at doing is being addicted to their video games and mobile phones. Only knows how to bring you to Swensens or jack's place every single anniversary until the day you die.

-He will probably cheat on you with some Siam Bu or KTV hostess someday. Pro tip: singaporeans hardly use Wechat or Line, so if he is spending alot of line on these apps, you may wana check his phone

But a few days later, she messaged me to meet up in person. I wanted to apologise for what I said, and to get some closure for our friendship of nearly 7 years if it couldn't be fixed, so I agreed to meet. At the meeting, she dropped a bombshell on me: she had been having romantic feelings for me for years.

I was shocked, but it did explain a lot of things: why she chose to hang out with me so often instead of her many other friends, her constant string of 'boyfriends' who never lasted more than 1-2 months. And yes, I was a little creeped out too.

Anyway, she asked me to go out with her. I was doubtful, but seeing as my dating prospects with guys are zero anyway I agreed to it even though I never considered being anything other than straight. We went on a few dates, and they were great. I never had the feeling of being loved by someone else before, but we clicked even better as partners than as friends. We talked for a long time about my feelings of jealousy and inadequacy, especially as it might affect us being in a romantic relationship, and I think I've gotten over it.

3) guy asks for whether she loves him

5) guy gets tired and breaks up after finding another girl

Personally I won’t date a sg girl anymore but I’m starting to feel that it’s not a personal bias but that there really is a problem with Sg girls. I went to research online and found out that it’s well known that sg girls have these issues. There’s an increasing trend that more sg guys are finding foreign wives too. 

To add on to my original post, yes girls from other countries are much prettier than sg girls. Just travel more and its obvious. It’s well known that Japanese and Korean girls are pretty, even without makeup. And it’s well known that majority of sg girls are materialistic princesses. They date for the status and not for the love. And they can’t even cook. Guys are the ones cooking for most of the married couples that I see. Most foreign girls have better attitude and treat men better than sg girls too because of their culture and upbringing. Sg girls are just overvalued while Foreign girls are ‘undervalued’ despite having their own flaws.

Honestly just get out of this tiny island and explore the world. Don’t be a frog in a well. The world has so much more to offer. It doesn’t mean everything in Singapore is the best. That also applies to sg guys as well. White guys and Koreans guys are better than sg guys in some ways too that’s why many sg girls want to date them. Just date a type that fits you, no need to restrict yourself on who to date. If there’s better people out there then date them.

1182,"In response to #63395: https://www.NUSWhispers.com/confession/63395
Pretty much in the same position as you as I'm studying overseas. Honestly never thought about relationships even though I knew I would have a family of my own someday (somehow). I literally didn't bother socialising much because some people were pretty superficial (academics, gym, investments etc were my top priorities). 
It was only when my housemates asked me about dating and marriage in general, which made me realise that I needed “experience” – dating experience, to discover what kind of person I’m looking for, how people behaved during dates, dos and don’ts, how to sustain a conversation etc. Trust me, I’m pretty introverted by nature as well, which didn’t help since I was very skinny as well last time, so I mainly focused on a variety of self-improvement (study hard, do stuff you enjoy, read more books). Now, some of my friends are even surprised that I’m still single despite taking care of my physique and having pretty ok grades.
Similar to you, I’m looking for someone from Singapore - similar values/upbringing etc., and so I started using tinder/CMB (CMB better imo) to meet new people whenever I'm back in SG. I've had good and bad dates/meetups, and I feel that only after having your fair share of good and bad dates will you realise what kind of person you’re looking for. Obviously all chats start off with topics such as hobbies, then you can ask about what they do for leisure, overseas exchange programmes (cooking and living alone etc, places they’ve visited – share pictures and stuff), how they view relationships (perhaps ask why they’re not attached etc.), why did they choose that degree/job position, what gets them up in the morning, their goals and dreams etc. If they’re someone who has pretty similar goals, go and ask them out to find out more about them.
As for group hangouts, you can always sit beside someone you’re interested in, get to know them through small talk etc. (can’t say much about that since I mainly use dating apps) – maybe can ask Jonathan Choi (11/10 solid advice).
My advice for you is to either sign up for NUS events, or just do it the simpler way - dating apps. I ALWAYS got awkward around females, especially when my housemates invited them over for drinks and stuff, but it is through these “failures” that you know how to spark conversations with random people. The more you are put in situations like these, the less awkward you will feel – similar to public speaking (I had mad jitters whenever I had to do those last time, now it’s pretty chill for me). 
I wish you all the best, and don’t dig into the mentality of “oh, I’m awkward as shit etc.”, just go out and try. Many a time we overthink and end up doing nothing. If it helps, just think of it as going out and making friends first – with males and females. Who knows, they might even introduce you to a potential someone.

No I became awaken to a simple truth: she is worth it and I would do anything to make her happy and keep her by my side forever. 
That included paying for almost everything (despite her insisting not). 

The crux of this issue is simple, it’s never about money. It’s about value. She is invaluable to me. I responded in a way only men do to ladies invaluable to them. 

When I had about $1k left in my account, I spent $600 on a diamond bracelet for our anniversary. I felt happy. Of course I had my pay coming soon but that wasn’t the point. She was touched, because she knew at that point of time, I didn’t have much but I was still willing to spend on her. 

So to the boys (not men, I don’t view many of u as men yet), have you ever asked yourselves why there are men willing to pay for their lady almost all the time? Why TF are they spoiling the market? Why make you look bad in comparison? 

The answer is simple AF. One day you will find a lady who is invaluable to you. You will realize you will do anything to keep her by your side. Money is never the focus but her value in yr heart is. When you do find such a lady and are prepared to say your vows to her for marriage, your native mindsets will be broken and you will emerge a man, ready to do anything for her. 

TLDR: If a guy don’t man TF up and behaves in a way that responds to how much a lady means to you, you will lose her. 

You will lose her to another man who values her more than 6x her salary but will to give 10x more than you would ever do.

To the ladies: behind every guy who doesn’t value you the way you deserve, there’s always more guys who are more than willing to treat you better.

So like from moving money around alone, he can make $10k in 2 weeks or $300/day. I haven’t started working yet but there’s no entry point career in sg that let’s me match his income. At first when we went out, I’d try to offer to pay every 3rd/4th date but then it got to a point where his spending is rly so uncontrolled, I cudn’t keep up, so he pays for us both mostly. He also has atas taste. Every regular meal at least costs $80+. Even eating at home he spends $40 on one meal. That’s like what I spend in 1-2 weeks. So after a while I stopped offering to pay bc I rly can’t but I feel bad that he pays for my everything after a while. Idk how guys think in these situations. He’s German & I hear dating culture there is 50-50? Is this a power move? Does he feel sorry for me? Or is he actually happy & willing to pick up the tab? Idk. I rly appreciate him so I don’t want him to feel like I’m financially abusing him of some sort. Also this is my first stable r/s so I don’t rly know what the cultural convention is. 

All & all, I’m not complaining. I’m just sharing my exp in this whole bgr payments thing

When will there be gender equality in the world? Let’s wait till one day men can get pregnant and go through labour pain then tell me about gender equality?

Sure, some of you there are gonna say objectively that that is a biological issue and should not be confused with gender equality and going Dutch right. Then, I shall be objective on gender equality. Can you men out there accept that your baby born to include the mothers’ surname too? If you cannot then you aren’t being objective either. If you can accept, you sure your dad and mum can accept?

Then again, some of you will say that is a different story because that’s marriage. But, if you don’t invest, do you think you will get a single return? 

If the girl is reasonable, she will not mind eating cheaper food with you. If you can’t afford high-end restaurant, voice it out. Don’t act like you can afford and then ask for separate bills.

I just wanted to say that if we become so calculative, every thing must be halved equally, then what’s the point of being in a romantic relationship? Just be single then?

1191,"I have been in a relationship for more than one year now, and i have always been paying for my meals after the first few dates onwards and treating my bf on special occasions as well as getting expensive gifts (around $800 in this year alone)

When it comes to who should pay, i feel that if guys offer to pay the first few meals while in the dating stage, it does help in showing that you are willing to pay for them and invest in the relationship. I didnt expect my bf to pay the first few times but i did appreciate the gesture. Then once the relationship is in the more comfortable stage, maybe a few months in, you can explain to your gf that while you do want to keep paying for her, you feel that treating her on special occasions and getting gifts, will make it more special than treating her every meal. This also helps you to save money so you can save up for these special occasions. 

If the girl isn’t a gold digger, she will completely understand if you guys just talk it out, i have a few guy friends who always complain to me about having to pay for their gfs, but when i ask if they tried asking the girlfriend, they said no, and assume that she wont be happy. But after i suggested them to talk it out with their gfs, it all worked out and the gfs do treat them occasionally now too, so point is dont be passive aggressive about it as it might not be clear to her that you are unhappy about having to pay. Most girls are decent enough to understand especially if they like you enough. If they don’t then it’s time to dump her.

1192,"Seems like a lot of people are discussing whether the guy should pay or not for the girl, so I figured I'd share my side of the story:

Me and my bf have been together for 1.5 years and we always fight to settle the bill at the counter. I want to pay because I am working part-time during the sem and he isn't. So we settled on me paying for the less frequent, more expensive meals and him paying for the more frequent, day-to-day kopitiam meals if we eat together. 

Now that he is interning and has a higher income stream than me, I let him pay a bit more frequently. 

In a nutshell: Girls, don't ask too much out of your SO esp if they are still students. You want to buy bag and clothes, use your own money la. Guys, it is ok to discuss things and let your SO pay sometimes. Don't worry about face ok, if she can't be understanding then probably she needs to reflect lol.

1193,"Honestly, what's with the recent truckload of guy having to pay for girl and all that bullshit. 

My story - Singaporean girl here, met husband in NUS. After 1 yr of dating, we decided that we were serious abt our r/s and started discussing plans for our future (marriage, kids, pre wedding photoshoots, honeymoon etc). We knew we needed a lot of money to make things work and we weren't rich. So while all our peers were partying away, going on couple holidays/staycay/getaways and grad trips; we were there giving private tuition and working our asses off during summer hols. We set up a joint account where we would contribute our hard earned money in. Of course, we had our own personal accounts but it weren't significant. We would scrimp and save wadever we can to make our dreams work. At e start of our r/s, we went dutch with the occasional presents for each other. After confirming that I'm the one for him, he decided to pick e tab most of e time (I'd insist on paying sometimes if its too expensive). As a result, I understand that he will not have much savings compared to me. Yrs later. He grad a yr earlier than me but didnt managed to get a job immediately. As such, he took up waitering temporarily to earn some money - determined to marry me when I grad. 

When I grad, I got a job immediately, earning more than him (even after he changed job from waitering to desk bound). I paid for all our dinner dates. Our wedding - we copaid for our rings, our banquet, our local and overseas pre wedding photoshoots and our honeymoon. Many of our frens were shocked as to how we did it in e year of my graduation; thinking we had financial help from our parents when we did not. Its amazing how 2 of us even saved at least 250k before e age of 30. 

Fast forward till today. We own a condo and have children of our own. I paid double e amt my hubby paid for our condo but I don't draw the lines with him and say hey, you're the man, you're supposed to pay for that roof over my head or I don't wanna marry you. Nah. We work tgt as a team. We support each other when we can. And now when I'm no longer working to care for our children, he pay for all the bills to support our family. 

Moral of e story is - if you love somebody wholeheartedly and see a future with them, work tgt as a team. Make it work. Don't be so calculative. Dreams take flight when you work tgt, not thrash each other.

1195,"So recently me and my friends have been talking about how horrible it is to date a singaporean girl. I myself have dated a Japanese girl before and they are better than Singapore girls in almost every aspect. it made me not want to date a Singapore girl anymore. 

Firstly they are not as pretty compared to Japanese/Korean/Taiwan/China girls. They even think Highly of themselves (when they are not) and think average men don’t deserve to date them. Secondly they all act like princesses and demand a lot. They think guys should pay for everything, buy them expensive gifts, drive them home every time despite not doing anything in return. Thirdly they are so fierce and bad tempered. In sg guys are probably scared of them as they’ve might erupt unreasonably anytime. 
Honestly the only good thing about Singapore girls that I can think of Is that they are independent and smart. 

In comparison, i felt like an slave when dating a Singapore girl while I felt like a king when dating a japanese girl. Japanese girls treat guy very well, are prettier and not demanding at all (even offer to pay for me).

1196,"I used to date this guy for a few months. Thinking back, i don’t know what i ever saw in him. He was vindictive and bear grudges for years, kept emphasizing how he expects the girl to “give” in a relationship (eg paying / planning dates), complains everything we have argued about to his friends, and just shift between emotionally so cold or easily angered over things. In all honesty, i’m finding it really difficult to state any redeemable quality about him at all (not even the superficial aspects), and i’ve never felt so badly treated by a person in my life. 

All i can say is that i’m glad that part of my life is over, and now i’ve found someone who has been the complete opposite of him - unconditionally loving, patient, easygoing and uncalculative. I must have saved a whole kingdom in my previous life because i feel so lucky to be able to meet someone like him :)

To others out there that are feeling miserably treated in your current relationship, my advice is to see objectively whether the relationship is worth salvaging or if you’re just holding onto it due to sentimental value / fear of being alone / delusion that it’ll get better.

1198,"To #63175 and #63218: I would like to share my experience with u guys. So I have just graduated, and met my ex in JC and we were together after A levels for quite a while, for 4 years until uni year 2. Similar to u guys she had the same problem, unrealistic expectations and expecting me to pay. Now don't get me wrong, who doesn't like to treat their girl? But I like to be the one to offer. But it became obvious that it went from being a treat to an obligation. Now before, I continue, I acknowledge this is only my side of the story, and I am just sharing my view point. If anyone is offended by this, I apologise in advance, but please don’t be too angry, it is just my story.

There were countless times where the red flags continuously showed. From her getting upset at me for not buying her flowers, even though our date was at a classy restaurant (and I’m paying), to her complaining about not receiving gifts (again even though I’m paying). She often compared me to other guys she saw on Instagram saying “this guy did this for his gf…etc.”. She was also incredibly high maintenance, she expected me to listen to her every problem, no matter how childish they were, but she never bothered to care about my problems. Ironically, she often gave that ""roll eye"" look and said I was not being a ""man"" when I talked about my problems. Also, she used sex and intimacy to control the relationship and expected me to share my bank PIN with her because it was a “sign of trust.”

Sounds familiar? But deep down, I always closed one eye, because I felt that she gave me “support” and brought “joy” to my life. We were together for 4 years, and I thought she was definitely the one I would marry. Hence when her family was going through financial difficulty, I paid for every date, because I believe that it was “us” against the world.

But I can guarantee you one thing, I was definitely and always be wrong. Remove the intimacy from the relationship, and my ex had nothing to offer. She was someone who wanted things, but doesn’t want to work for it nor does she even bother to try. The only reason she did things for other is because she expected others to do the same for her. The whole relationship was me being blinded by love.

Eventually towards the end of 4 years, I really questioned myself and realized that this was not the partner I want nor will I ever want. And we broke up, it was kind of a rushed breakup, but it was because I really had enough. I wasn’t sad when we broke up, for some reason I felt really relieved.

I do admit I do miss her from time to time, but I know what I missed were the memories, not the person.

This is the advice I can give you both: a relationship is not a feeling, it is not love, it is a commitment. After all, our bank accounts are not unlimited, if your partner fails to realise that and insist that you paying is a “sign” of love, please, don’t be blinded by love. While people were saving, my bank account decreased greatly during those 4 years, and I have nothing to show for it after spending that much.

Trust me, if anyone out here is in a relationship and asking yourself this question: “Why am I paying all the time?” or you notice yourself spending less on other things just so you can keep up with spending in your relationship. Recognize that no matter how good your partner may seem, it is a recipe for failure in the long term, especially if you plan on living forever with that person.

Fast forward to today, I graduated from NUS and I am still single. But during the last 2 years of my uni life, I was free and I worked on myself. I was able to do all the things I was unable to do and improve myself greatly. Going to the gym and learning new hobbies. 

Eventually I would want to date someone else, but for now, I want to improve me first!

Remember, the first step to loving someone is to be able to love yourself first. If you have to sacrifice loving yourself and your own happiness to love someone else, you are not in love, you are in a dream, and you better wake up. If your wants are causing a problem in a relationship. Please wake up too and go and run 10 rounds around the parade square. For me, I knew it was a problem because I wanted to save for our future, but she wanted to spend it all because “we are young only once.”

Our society has trained us to be materialistic, and is often hard to find partners who do not compare, partners who look on Instagram and see other boyfriends and be jealous. It is not their fault, this is the effect of social media.
For those who have loving partners, partners who tell you they want to eat cheap to help you save money, the partners who sit down and listen to even your smallest problems, and never condescend you, the partners who you know will never let their wants get in the way or cause problems in the relationship. Please, hold them close, and tell them everyday that you love them. Because they are indeed a rare breed that will only get rarer.
Best of luck!

how do you handle conflicts/disagreements? when talking to friends and siblings about their relationships, i realised that something that varies between them a lot is their attitude (and their partner's) towards things they cannot agree on. 

do you both take time to understand what the other party wants and why? when you let them ""win"" (so to speak), what do you feel about this decision and about them? are you calculating/counting each time they bring up something that they disagree with, just to ensure that you do not rock the boat more than them? 

if you can reach a situation where you and your partner are truly honest about anything that upsets either of you, talk about it rationally and not taking it personally, and are comfortable and understanding when things do not go your way, that is a sign of a good relationship.

The typical third-party mentality, if he's not married he is still available? Bullshit.

After realising his 'feelings' for the snake, he broke up with my friend recently during their supposed romantic getaway where she flew across the globe to meet him. 

My friend and this asshole never felt the need to publicise their relationship extensively on social media so only a few mutuals know they were dating before (so steady, so stable that I was geniunely waiting for their wedding invite until this happened), how she was cheated on horribly, and how she was left with no other alternative except to agree to the break up and left helpless in a foreign country.

Recalling my friend's words about how he told her during the breakup that this is ""part and parcel of life"" makes my blood boil.

I can't help to wonder if he ever felt guilty about what he did to her, if he was conscious that what he did is considered cheating and what the snake did is morally inacceptable. 
It seems like he is treating the relationship with my friend as something that never happened too.

Cheating is far too normalised that its infuriating.

Even the nicest person you know is capable of doing so, which is exactly what happened to my friend here. I lost faith in humanity after hearing about this.

I told her that I'm fine with her seeing other guys too because we aren't officially in an exclusive relationship seeing as we only know each other for a few weeks or so only and only gone out like less than 5 times. I don't know why she is kicking up such a fuss about me lying to her about it (she didn't ask me and I didn't say because I always thought most people understand that exclusive dating must be stated and not assumed).

1224,"We broke up in 2018 january because he lost quite a sum of money in an entrepreneurial project and got depressed. He could not commit emotionally. But we got together after a week of breaking up because we love each other so much. In january 2019, I found out he went clubbing on the day we broke up. Took a picture with this hostess and start talking to her ever since, until i found out about their conversation on jan 2019. 

They spoke in another language which i wasnt familiar with but i could comprehend SOME of it. It was greeting each other good morning/afternoon/night. She will ask him when is he coming back to see her. She will ask him money too. (But he said he didnt gave her money). I couldnt understand what he replied to most of them though. All these happened (talking to her and shit) when he was being cold to me (tho we r in a relationship) because he said he was still bothered by the fact that he lost a huge sum of money in his project. During this time, i was crying almost everyday trying to make this relationship work and get back the lovely and sweet boyfriend he used to be. 

He stopped being cold to me when it was ard midyear yet he continued talking to her. We were happy starting mid year. He started being sweet all over again. 

One day i got a bad instinct. Went to check out his Line app and saw their conversation. I was super shocked and speechless. Couldnt stop crying. Note that i never check his phone before because i trusted him.

He apologised and said he was very inconsiderate to my feelings when he did that. I will bring up this issue everytime because i get paranoid. It seems to him that im attacking him of cheating again but im just afraid it will happen again. I get anxious when he likes other female pictures on instagram as well. I cant help it. I cant help but to overthink time and time again because im so afraid. I will ask “are u talking to any girl?” Then he will be annoyed because it seems like im attacking him.

Did he emotionally cheated on me? What do yall think? How do i move on from this? Im really desperate as i am becoming toxic in this relationship. I want us to get better because he is loyal now but i cant seem to get over the past. How do i stop feeling paranoid? How do i trust again? Please advice.

1225,"Over the years I can’t help but notice how girls’ tragic romance confessions revolves only around a few topics:

1) Being cheated on
2) Breakup due to differences over time
3) Agreeing to sex to prove mutual feelings
4) Finding it hard to turn down requests for sex
The list goes on and on. 

People say love is blind. But I call it plain dumb. 

How can girls who study in so called top ranking in the world universities not have the mental capacity to look beyond the surface? 

Those guys in uni don’t even have an income much less to say promise you a future together yet girls give them everything. 

When the time comes for graduation guys have the easy way out of relationships by quoting work commitment, change in values etc. Sounds familiar?

What about the girls? They end in up on dating apps. You’ve no idea how many girls have mentioned believing the person they used to make out with were their true love. But it’s all pump and dump.

Call it “true love” as you may, but i call the current generation of girls as sexually groomed without a moral compass.

I've only had one hookup prior to my current bf, and that was basically my entire sexual experience. It's awkward seeing the guy I hooked up with in school since it was kinda a series of bad decisions that led me to hook up with him. Then again it was a long time ago, I was immature and hasty. Anyway I'm not sure he remembers me. I just tend to avoid him and his friends in case he remembers, and since my bf knows him too I tend to just leave them alone when they talk in case he remembers what happened between us.

Sometimes I catch myself thinking and wondering if my current bf (who's a virgin) would be as good in bed as my hookup/FWB at the time since he was pretty experienced being a couple years older and having quite a lot of experience. I'm not sure if thinking like this is healthy for my relationship and I don't really know how to stop? It's like I want to stay with my bf, definitely, but I'm just always stuck wondering about the sex? I''m just not sure about what I can do to manage this. Is this normal?

At some point, I have a crush for almost all female SoC friends I know (this was before I got attached so don't bash on me too early, I'm a human too..), but I didn't approach any of them to start anything.

My current GF actually approached me and things developed from there. The funny thing is... I got to know some of these female crushes I had before on better terms through projects, classes and stuff and a few of them confessed that they had a crush on me before and regretted not chasing me back when I was single. 

I don't get it, it's the 21st century and people regardless of gender should not live under the preconceived notion that guys should always make the first move. So instead of asking SoC guys to do better, why not everyone just make a point to approach the guy or girl you are interested to know/date before it is too late for regrets?

Anyway, the market value of guys increases over age but the same might not be true for girls, so stop all this ""Guys should take the initiative"", ""Guys please do better"" bullshit please.

1241,"I actually need some relationship advice, and no, it's not exactly the usual kind of r/s drama. My case is quite difficult, that's why I'm conflicted on what I should do. Let me start from the beginning. 

I met this girl at a bar last year, she was still in Singapore at that time. She is a uni student from the US, and she was just visiting as tourist with her friends. We befriended each other over the course of the 1 week she was here and I showed her around. Unfortunately, she had to return back to her country of course. Over the next few days we talked a lot through the phone and eventually, our friendship blossomed to romance (very prematurely, in hindsight). But as I got to know her more, I realized the she wasn't the one for me as I'm starting to lose interest in her (we do not like the same things, we can't keep up a conversation, we're not compatible basically). I'm starting to get bored too actually. Don't get me wrong, I believe that I CAN stand the distance, I'm actually a really patient guy. It's just that our incompatibility is making the distance more unbearable as each and every day I can feel her emotional connection slipping away from me. Take note, I realized that I don't like her as a girlfriend, but she makes a good friend. I still care about her.

Here's where the trouble comes in. 
I want to tell her all these things, right? I don't want to waste her time, and I don't want to waste my own time too. But I feel OBLIGED to stay with her. Why? Because 

1) She has already booked a plane ticket to see me in 4 months, by HERSELF. 

2) At the same time, I don't know if I can wait any longer because 4 months is a very long time. 

She said to me once, if I ever leave her she would just block me because she still loves me very much and it would hurt her. So asking if she could be my friend instead is out of the question. There is no way she could come to Singapore as a friend.

If I break things off with her now, what is she going to do? I don't want to waste her money for nothing. She still loves me a lot, I don't want her to come here by herself with a broken heart. 

Any advice on what I could do? Wait it out or break it off?

scribbled thousands of reasons one can imagine

1244,"Sometimes it is obvious that she is avoiding me and pretending I do not exist. Can see that she nervously stutters when I even get to engage in conversation with her in real life. When we cross paths, she almost always freezes. Then again, it is hard to find her in person since she is an introvert and also keeps to herself mostly.

There have been instances where I get signals that she has a liking for me but I cannot tell for sure since it is not explicit. But she is an interesting and thoughtful person and I would like to get to know her better in person beyond texting. I do not think she has a boyfriend since she has does not really have guy friends.

So basically,
i) How do I tell the difference between disinterest and introversion/shyness from a really introverted girl?

ii) How do people in general become close friends with introverts since they avoid social settings and small talk?

I do not want to come off as too strong in case she is easily socially overwhelmed/anxious. In one world, she has a liking for me but is too socially anxious/overwhelmed by it. In another world, she might think I am a creep for all I know.

1254,"With all the (supposed) girls from SoC coming out to say that you can't find a boyfriend in SoC, let me say that as a guy in SoC we have a simple rule of thumb when it comes to any girl we meet (assuming a heterosexual relationship):

If the girl is attractive in anyway to us, be it physically, emotionally, personality, and etc. she's probably attached so most decent guys won't make a move. This often rings true; most guys make this assumption unless told otherwise... Then prepare for an onslaught of sausages as the guys will stash their code and commit for you.

Else, the likely truth is that the girl is simply unattractive, batshit crazy, or a lesbian that has zero interest in guys, which is why no guy is making any advances. Minus the lesbian part, it's the same exact reasons as to why certain guys still can't get hitched or a date. 

The best first two steps to mitigate unattractiveness and get a partner in SoC and anywhere else on this planet:
1. Be attractive.
2. Don't be unattractive.

If you have already satisfied these 2 steps, then simply wait or start making some advancements on the guy/girl. Else, keep trying to make yourself attractive in some way.

May seem like a slightly naive question, but how does one know if they've met the right girl? In particular, I have two experiences I want to recount. 

I been talking to and meeting up with Girl A for a few months now. I've enjoyed our meetings, and I would say she sweeps me off my feet. Whenever we meet she'll have a lot of interesting stories to share. One could say she's my dream girl, but when I'm with her I don't really feel completely at ease if I'm to be honest. I always feel like I have to be on my guard, and the ""best"" version of myself.

Then there's Girl B. We've known each other for longer, and we have good banter. I feel so comfortable when I'm with her, like I can express myself freely and openly, and basically be my true self. I wouldn't say she sweeps me off my feet, but I would definitely consider her.

Is love supposed to be like things are with Girl A? Where you feel this sense of euphoria each time, but also feel constrained in your interactions with her? If I continue going out with Girl A, will this lack of feeling at ease get better, and will I eventually warm up to her and become more comfortable with spending time with her? Or is love closer to what I described with Girl B, someone who could be your best friend at the onset? Who you can be yourself around, but perhaps doesn't ignite in you the same sense of anticipation or euphoria as Girl A?

Do not be disheartened. I am somewhat like you. I do not have any material wealth to speak of. I come from an extremely humble background, my family were homeless for a few years even and we sought refuge under the roofs of relatives.

That being said, it wasn't all that bad. I mean, I'm here in Asia's best university aren't I? I somehow beat the odds but I had a lot of help along the way.

Also, I have been dating someone from a background that could not be more different than mine. She comes from an extremely wealthy family. And yet she chose me, someone who came from nothing.

She told me that she was attracted to me because of the fact that I am a person of strong character. Guess what? It was precisely because of the long years of hardship and uncertainty that had annealed me into this person. (So make your unfortunate circumstances count)

However, while the 2 parties may be happy with each other, people will say things. Nasty things. Especially if one party is not only poor but of a race that is stereotyped as ""cannot make it one"". You'll have people saying to her ""are you sure he's that intelligent?"" (because intelligence is only accorded to the upper echelons of society right) or ""people who are *my race* cannot make it one la"" or just about anything to do with race or SES.

You click into their profile and they look exactly the way you would imagine him to- a socially awkward Otaku that posts about how lonely he is.

Don’t get me wrong, I have nothing against Otakus or being socially awkward. But post after post about being lonely, giving up on finding a partner, being called a creep by other girls.etc. It almost feel like these people are so comfortable in their self-pity that it’s all the reality they know.

I know life isn’t fair. Some of us are born better looking, or healthier, or richer or whatever & if you are going to argue based on natural selection- the fittest, the best genes procreate & survive then yes y’all have all the reason in the world to wallow yourself in your self pity.

 But at the end of the day, this is not a hunting ground and we are not barbarians. We are all civilised being in a civilised society trying to find meaning, Joy & trying to live life.

So to those of y’all out there that constantly complain about being lonely & ugly & whatever, I have tips for y’all:

1)Think about who you are trying to attract & then consider who those people are attracted to? Who do you think are attracted to you? How can you become someone they are attracted to? [Then start working on them. Be the man of your dreams.]

2)Shut up. All your whining doesn’t really do too much for you- it’s also terrible branding. Because now you are known as the weird guy who goes around telling people how pitiful he is.

3)Work on yourself. Like if you spent 1 hour per day in the gym instead of wallowing in self pity. You would have at least look better and feel better by the time you are done working out. 

4)Don’t look like a such a ‘looser’. Spent money, buy clothes that makes you feel good and look good. Don’t know how? Pinterest, Google,YouTube. Tons of resources at your disposal- the question is do you want to work on yourself?

5)Learn. Just as you would do so if you were weak in a subject. Go learn how to interact with people, learn charisma, learn how to be an interesting individual that draws life to himself. Watch charisma on command, read 12 rules of life by Jordan Peterson. Ask people you look up to how they did it. There are plenty of resources!

I know it’s hard being you. But working on it rather than complaining about it is almost always better. It’s never too late to be the better version of yourself. So stop being such a whiny bitch and go do something about it. Your life is yours to live. Jiayou.

But you cheated on me with him, and I only found out after your friends let me know that he always went home with you and that you guys would disappear for hours on end in school. I wasn't in the same school, and I just trusted that you wouldn't do anything funny in school, or that you wouldn't do anything while home alone. I can't get over what he did with you, and I can't stop imagining how it played out.

Did he approach you first or were you the one who approached him? After all, the receipt for condoms was with you.

1267,"Hi, I'm 32yo (Guy) and been single for 6 years plus, my family is quite complicated due to parents is separated since i was 5yo and never been having a family feel and stress i can never shared last time, i have 3 elder sister but never really in good terms since young, but now i'm 32yo things have been changed in the family slightly better but yet its been hard. 

I myself have diabetes due to family history, 5 years ago i was nearly blind due to my condition and i didn't gave up and change my lifestyle such as going gym, research and eating healthy, then i able to fight through and from 80kg to 63kg currently, no more medication required as i control my sugar intake very strictly and i even went to take up a personal trainer certificate and help others ppl facing problem like me last time. 

I have lots of scar on me and not really good looking, i have tried many ways to know new girls such as tinder or etc... for the past 3 years i have tried quite hard in searching my partners but never got one, i gave up last year on using such app as i got hurt really bad from many ppl in the app, i have tried 2 ways, one is telling the truth in my profile of my illness and 2nd is not telling them, my friend advice me not to tell first and try to know girls first and then slowly tell them the truth. but in my heart i felt bad for not telling but yet i tried my friend advice, so.... after some of the girls that i manage to stay in touch in the app and continue chatting, i told them about my illness and family background, they straight away not talking to me anymore. But some yes, they did replied me and they sort of tell me they are just looking for friends to tell in a way to reject me, some even told me (Why would i choose a unhealthy one where i can find a healthy and good looking one) this is where i got hurt that bad and gave up. 

Recently i had a trip with my company colleagues, there's a girl actually i interested in but i know she got attached recently and therefore i tried not to go near her although i felt a connection, i told myself again the reality i am facing, why would she want to be with me even she is not attached. I am not tall, handsome nor well live off, with illness and probably can't have child due to my illness that had made me very low sperm count and also i don't want to pass down my illness to my spouse although i wish to have a family. I am really sad but i can't achieve anything as simple as a relationship. 

In my life i only had 1 relationship where i did not turn out well, i really do love my partners if i still able to find some one i like and of course she like me too (even she does not), i will always try my best for her.

Thanks NUSWhispers for having such page for sharing people story, if not i can't find a place to share. 

Appreciate if real people can talk to me regarding such situation i facing in my life.

1268,"Hi #61943, 

I've been in an LDR for ~3 years myself, and I can relate to the worries in your post. 

For me, the most important thing was to communicate. Try to be honest with each other, and be upfront about your individual expectations. For example, you said ""I feel that if a person really matters to me, I will still find time everyday to talk to her..."" Does she know you think this? It also sounds like you weren't officially in a relationship before she left. Would you be hurt if she decided to date someone while overseas, and vice versa? Try talking it out with her, and see if her expectations of the relationship match with yours. 

If you both decide to go ahead with the LDR, here are some tips: 
- Arrange visits if you can. It really helps to know when you'll see each other again; even better if you know the final deadline of the LDR when you'll be together. It's nice to take turns to visit, but if not then discuss it openly, don't let flights/money become a sore point. 
- About flights: Google Flights is great, in particular for tracking flight prices. It's best to buy from the airline directly; avoid fishy-looking third parties. If you plan to fly frequently, look for card rebates, discounts, points etc. 
- If money is a problem but you're determined, this is a chance to get resourceful. Part-time jobs can help (NUS has some). 
- Make sure to continue living your life while apart. You'll have more interesting things to share when you message or meet up. If you can, do something fun/creative with the messages and calls, or try snail mail :)  

If something doesn't work out, it's okay to agree to separate, and try again if in future you're both single and in the same place. Good luck!

I am pretty good looking, I would say I am generally funny, and a pretty high achiever, so it's really no problem for me to get a girl interested in dating me. I have been dating around for the past two years and all those relationships turned out to be more like a Fwb relationship than a real relationship. The 3 girls that I have dated after my first all seem to drop interest in me when I start asking them serious relationship question like ""where do you see us moving on from here?"". The first few dates would always turn out to be good and eventually it would lead to sex, but whenever I try to move beyond sex the girl will start to drop interest and eventually siam me.  It really makes me wonder what is wrong with me. Is it the way I am dating them or is it just the kind of girls I am dating.

What if I don’t mind living the married life, and even have kids next time, but just not get married for the sake of it?

I'm currently waiting for uni to start in August and she's currently studying overseas. We started going out on dates in November last year when she was still in Singapore. As I was still trying to know her better, I didn't rush into a relationship with her though I felt that the feeling was mutual. After she left, we continued to keep in touch everyday through messages or calls and everything was pretty smooth sailing. Recently her replies became more and more irregular and we didn't had a proper conversation for close to a week. She claimed that she was really busy studying for tests and rushing for submissions, which I believe are valid reasons. However, I feel that if a person really matters to me, I will still find time everyday to talk to her even if it's just a short 10-20 minutes. But it didn't happen during that week.. 

We're still on pretty good terms right now but I feel that it's slowly going downhill and I can't really do much about it as we're thousands of kilometres apart. I think that I'm  a guy who's relatively clingy (is this normal haha) and I'm having second thoughts about pursuing a LDR. 
Anyone with similar experiences please feel free to share your thoughts ! Was I simply overthinking and what are the ways to have a healthy LDR ?

In fact, that teacher was married at that point in time and their relationship lasted for 6 months. I was enraged.

I'm in a unique position, a sugar relationship. She is everything that I could have asked for except, our love languages differs. I craved physical touches, showing of affection while she is more into showering in gifts, and words of affirmation. While I have no problem giving in to her needs, she just wouldn't make any to my needs. We had a non-serious conversation and showing her my love languages (i.e. bringing her hands and roam randomly), and telling her I need her to touch me more, she just laughed it off and thought I was horny.
Awhile ago, I was on my way going home, I saw many young couples have no problem showing their affection on trains. (I.e. explicitly touching their partners butts and light discreet pettings).
I wonder if I should dump current r/s or I should have 1 serious talk to her about my needs?

1277,"Good evening to all. I'm the OP for #61516. 

For the past few days I had read through the various replies towards my post about BTech and I'm heartened to receive mostly positive reactions. But I believe there are a few points raised by various comments I should address.

But before I begin, please, please, type ""btech"" into the search bar and look at the all past post about btech. You would understand that there are students out there who do feel inferior, when compared to a BEng student. There are students who are lost, wondering whether to take up BTech. Remember that my post wasn't explicitly meant to glorify BTech. My post was to give an insight from an employer's POV and to motivate, albeit with a little bit of comparison between BTech and BEng. Because as I've mentioned, that post was triggered over a conversation that I overheard.

Some of you take it to challenge my POV and I welcome that. I have over 17 years of experience since I graduated from BEng and my POV is going to be a very direct one, from an ex-employee into an employer's POV.

Employers do not care how much hard work you put into to land yourself into NUS/NTU/govt universities.
Employers do not care how much you suffered while you are in school. Employers do not care how stress you were when you are taking 5 modules along with CCAs.
Employers do not care about the personal history and emotional baggage of all prospective interviewees and how they fought for placings.
Employers certainly do not care about your jealousy towards a particular individual who f*cked around during his younger days and managed to secure himself in BTech while you slog your life away in BEng, with a 5.0 GPA.

Remember, every hiring manager (probably) was an undergraduate once. We know the hardship. You are NOT special. We do not know you. You do not deserve our emotional attention on why you are more worthy just because you think you worked very hard for it.

Lets be practical. My company is like a bleeding wound. I need someone who can stop the bleed. Your hard work securing that 5.0 GPA and your water canoe (sorry for using you an example) CCA isn't going to help me with that.

Every year I have hundreds of students who apply for jobs. All highlighting about their GPAs and their merit achievements. Fair enough, that is all they have to showcase about themselves. Having those positive points in your resume only tells me 2 things. You are able to multi-task between school and other activities, and you did your homework before taking your exam.

When I hire an undergraduate, I expect them to think like an undergraduate. When I hire a graduate, I expect them to think like a graduate. When I hire a diploma graduate, I expect them to think like a diploma graduate. That is, you know your stuffs. Besides your theoretical knowledge on the subject, you have nothing to bring to the table to scale my company's business higher. With that piece of paper, you enter the workforce as a blank piece of paper and you go around demanding high pay while having sub-par knowledge and/or experience. Employers do not appreciate that. We need talents. We have budget. Sense of self-entitlement no? Elitist thinking that you are better just because you're from BEng?

Getting a degree is like a rite of passage for most of us. But it is a very carefully considered decision for full time working adults. Especially for long haul courses like BTech, where I'm aware that class sizes shrinks up to 50% to 60% from first year towards the last.

I do not doubt the quality that BEng offers. I certainly agree that BTech's curriculum stringency is watered down. To say that BTech students in general only want to pass is true as well. Which was precisely why I said the truth lies in the students themselves.

You can offer an incredibly quality content rich course like BEng. When you have students who graduated with flying colours, yet unable to perform their task as expected, it's a fail. You can offer a watered down BTech course. When you have student's who's goal is to pass and forget, is also a fail.

Like what one of our fellow OP said,

- Part time BTech is easier to pass but harder to maintain
- Full time BEng is harder to pass but has higher quality learning
- Both produces graduates of the same calibre, mostly overconfident but cmi


They're equally true. Whether they can bring the required knowledge and skills to the table, it's entirely up to them. To outright say that BEng is more superior than BTech is misleading. Likewise to say that BTech is inferior compared to BEng. 

At the end of the day, whoever can contribute most to the company, is favored most. (Copy, Paste)Employers looks for more than paper qualifications. The character, knowledge and skills that a BTech student presents, is worth more than a fresh graduate's first class hons. 5 years down the road, whoever can offer more of their skills and knowledge, whoever can display more achievements, goes to better places, be it a BEng or a BTech.


And for god's sake, can you students please stop with all these sexual dramas in school. Is that why my applicants mostly fail because they're more concern about having sex than actually studying. It is even more happening than K dramas.

Peace.

1279,"Reading the whole saga about the FWB guy supposedly knocking up the girl and now debating who should take responsibility for what, it left a very sour taste in my mouth. 

You wanna know what's worse than that? Going abroad to study, thinking you'd be in a LDR with your GF back in Singapore for those three years and then come back to her. Only to get a message halfway into Freshers' Week when you're overseas settling into life there from your girlfriend telling you she's breaking up with you out of guilt... because apparently despite only being together three months earlier, despite her losing her virginity to you only two weeks before you flew off, and always using protection thereafter, she tells you that she somehow found out she was pregnant and that she's already gotten a chemical pill abortion without even telling you anything beforehand. 

Then drop everything you were doing there and buy air tickets to fly back to try and see her and salvage anything possible. Not even knowing if she was lying about the pregnancy because so much didn't seem right about her story, or if it was really true and you just lost your first child that you'd have gladly taken responsibility for. And the final kicker? Arrive back in Singapore, but never get to see her again because she freaked out about you actually being serious enough to fly back to look her up again, and getting her mother to turn you away and leave things irrevocably broken. 

Bonus part of this story: one year later you return to Singapore for summer holidays and somehow manage to meet up with your ex's close friend. And then you hear from her that your ex was never pregnant. That she made that whole story up because she feared that I would be attracted by Western girls overseas, and in her fear of being cheated on she decided to break things off first but somehow couldn't do so directly. Hence the cooking up of the fake pregnancy and abortion story, because somehow in society the stereotype is of guys knocking girls up but running away at the first opportunity to shirk their share of responsibility. Not expecting you to actually NOT be one of those stereotypical guys, not expecting you to fly back halfway around the world for her, not expecting that you were actually serious about keeping the relationship and possibly even the baby if it were a real thing. 

Yeah, this is the story of my life. This is a major reason why I'm so scarred when it comes to relationship and love. And to that confessor who actually dared to comment about how much money he spent on condoms in that confession, I really spit on you for being such a disgrace to us men, for your absolute lack in placing priority on the right things, and for your petty complaint and whining.

We have been in a serious relationship for 2.5years. However, the topic of having children has always been brought up leading to us having some heated discussions.

I've been thinking about this for quite a while now. There's a friend I've been crushing on for about 2-ish months now, and we're pretty decent friends (from my POV). He's a really matured and fun but a wise person that brings people comfort when you talk to him (online, since he's currently not in school because of SEP) and I enjoy chatting with him.

It seems like a real dead case because we haven't spent a lot of time together before he left, and from how he speaks in a more social environment, he doesn't seem to see me that way? (Or should I spend more time hanging out with him when I can after he comes back?)

One of the biggest fear of confession is probably the fact that it could ruin any friendship between the two people, so I was wondering if there's any way to confess without ruining the friendship. I wanted to try the April's Fool method, but I figured not to. Ultimately, even if he doesn't see me this way, I want to keep this friendship. He's a friend I treasure dearly and I don't want to lose him just because of an unmatched feeling I have for him.

After comparing with #61241, I have come to conclude 2 things. 

1. Guys in general are huge trolls. I mean, just look at the number of guys on my heart list. #facepalm

2. Guys in general have much more bro code. Just look at the number of guys who recommended their bros to the OP of #61241. Girls, where is your sis code?!

To OP of #61241, maybe we should just get together. I fulfil all your requirements, and maybe more.. but you gotta date me to find out *winks

I’m a girl who’s in a relationship with a guy. We’re a happy couple, sex is great and all except I have never orgasmed with him. Both of us had two sexual partners before and I was able to cum with my previous partners and he could also make his partners orgasm so it’s not like he’s bad at sex or I can’t cum but I just can’t cum with him. Sex with him is amazing but I can’t reach that peak despite us trying the past eight months.

As such, I’m slowly getting resentful because I’m really sexually frustrated and with finals coming, I’m even more stressed. I treasure this relationship a lot but I don’t know if I can live with never having an orgasm again with a partner. Am I being stupid to be upset about this? Or is this a valid concern I have? Maybe some of you guys will tell me to suck it and be content with what I already have (an awesome boyfriend), maybe some would advise me to break up... I really do love my boyfriend but I’m ashamed to say that this is adversely affecting me. Any advice for me please?

1307,"I find it hard to date local girls after returning from my university education overseas. Spending a few years living and studying abroad has somehow widened my perspective on life, and added to my experiences as a person. On the bright side, it probably means I've become a changed and better person from my exposure to the world outside of Singapore (and I don't mean the sort of curated overseas experience in any number of cookie-cutter metropolitan Singapore-esque city). But on the flip side, I find local/Asian girls impossibly suffocating with their relative passiveness, lack of opinions, a general feeling of total sheltered upbringing, sexual conservativeness, and shallowness in life, happy to just be distracted by vapid topics of what's the latest in showbiz or workplace gossip or shopping or fashion or whatever. 

Am I the only one who feels this way? Or am I holding local girls to standards too high for them to meet? I'm sure there must be local girls with strong distinct personalities, who can both give and take opinions intelligently and with conviction, who are well-read and spoken, who have dreams and aspirations and purposes in life that go way beyond surviving month to month, and who aren't subscribing to that old trope about Asian girls being sexual prudes or so passive that they need the guy to make the first move in love and in bed before they know what to do or say for their own enjoyment and satisfaction.

While this is going on, I have also met my ex in a recent gathering (we share a group of friends, just that she hangs out less with this group compared to me). We didn't really end on a bad note so we're still somewhat on talking terms, and talked quite a bit during this gathering.

I seemed to have developed feelings for girl A. I definitely enjoy hanging out with her. On the other hand, I'm starting to recall memories of my ex, which are stirring up emotions. I'm confused if I really developed feelings for girl A, or it's just dormant feelings of my ex creeping back. 

I don't know if it's a good idea, but I'm been thinking if I should talk to my ex about this. Talking to girl A is out of the question, because she's attached, and a generally good friend who I want to keep. Whereas my ex is single, and based on my understanding, she would be cool to talk about this. 

Based on all these, I hope the NUSWhispers community can help me answer 2 questions: Do y'all think I have feelings for girl A or my ex? Is it a good idea to talk to my ex about this? Thanks.

1314,"After reading many relationships post here, I would like to remind girls to think twice before getting a boyfriend or husband who is younger than you. 
One simple reason is you are going to look older and much older when the time comes. Ladies age much faster when they hit 30s and if they give birth late. Given the current statistics, many girls are getting married later in life and that meant most will give birth late too. For man, their appearance stays about the same from 30s to maybe late 40s so they appear to age slower. Therefore, imagine you looking like a 40 y/o auntie but your husband looks like your younger brother in his 30s.
Next, is sex life. This might be a taboo for many or the issue wasnt raised to be heard. The older generation may or may not face the issue but it is highly unlikely that they would share this with us if they had the problem. Back to my point. Females face menopause earlier in life, many in their 40s now. Their sex drive drops tremendously and it also hurts in bed due to biological reasons. However, most males do not face this problem and their sex drive remains high till 70s or even older. Now, do you see the age gap in difference? 
Could this shed some light on why old men like to date young girls? All the ONS and mistresses?  
There are also news on man beating up wife for refusing sex... 
People always say that age is just a number, but I hope that this gives the girls an extra considering factor when choosing a boyfriend and their future spouse. 
I am open to anyone's opinion on this issue but please no trolling, thanks.

My boyfriend whom I've been with for about a year is often impatient with me, and gets annoyed with me over the the smallest of things e.g. asking a same question more than once, forgetting something, failing to answer a question properly or just some innocent remark can set him off. He doesn't treat his friends like, and can be very charming and patient with others so I guess it's just me. And I'm really upset tbh since I feel that someone who loves you would not be impatient or annoyed with you over what seems to me as non-existent issues. He would try to make up after his temper outbursts and we would have a talk about it but it still happens the next time. I fear having to tread on eggshells in a relationship, not knowing when and what would set him off. I feel that this is causing our relationship to lose the spark and I can't foresee a long term relationship if he's going to stay like this.

I thought we will be fine, but fast forward 8 months, I'm really lonely. Sure, we do skype about once a week. But we seldom text, due to the mega time zone difference. Sometimes, I want to tell him something that made me upset or sad during work, but that will be the time he is sleeping and can't respond to my texts until the next 6-8 hours. As the day dragged on, whatever negative feelings I have dissipated and I no longer feel the urge to tell him. That feeling of loneliness when I know that he isn't quite there for me is real. I also felt we are slowly drifting apart.

I guess he is coping well enough without me by his side, and often when I watched his insta stories he would be at some bar with a bunch of colleagues around him. He seemed really happy,  and sometimes I wonder if I should let go of this relationship since we doesn't seem to be walking in the same path in the future anymore. 

I really don't think I can stay in a LDR, and at the same time I do not want to give up my job with my good friends around too. And I know that it is unfair for me to ask him to come back to Singapore. I love him, and I want the best for him, and whatever makes him happy.

Soooo 3 months ago, my boyfriend of 5 years told me that he was also dating another friend of mine without me knowing and that he wanted a polygamy. That friend of mine told me that she knew he was dating me but she thought that I knew he was dating her too. I told him that I could not accept being in a polygamy. Broke up with him and broke the friendship with her in December.

Met him last week to pass his stuff back to him (I used to help him fix his electronics but he never got them back from me since he often came to my house to play with them anyway). He said he broke up with that friend, and wants me back. I still have feelings for him, but couldn't forgive him, so I rejected him.

After apologising and begging me to go back to him for about an hour, he asked ""I spent so much effort to try to win you back, spent so much money in the past few months trying buy things for you, I lost everything just to get you back, are you telling me that it's all for nothing?""

I never asked for it. I never asked you to buy me anything. When we broke up, you said you felt bad that it's always me who bought you gifts during anniversaries and special events the past 5 years, saying that you were very thankful that I always offer to pay for the meals or allow us to pay for our own meals, yet during the past few months when we never contacted each other much, you're telling me that you've put in a lot of effort and money to win me back? I'm not sure how I should have reacted. I just ran off crying without paying for the bill this time.

More than heartbroken, I felt more disappointment. Disappointed in myself for having feelings for him even after all these farce, disappointed that my friend never told me about their relationship when I always gushed to her about the things that happen between him and I, disappointed in him as a whole.
He's still texting me, yet I can't bear to block him out of my life. I want to move on, yet I still miss him. I can't forgive my friend, yet I wish to have her back in my life.

Recently, i think it's time for us to meetup after such a long period of texting. He agreed to the meetup. But, his response became colder after agreeing to meet and now he have MIA-ed for a week. 

For a guy that seems so keen, wanting to meet me in the past few months, why will it lead to this way ?... He seems like a genuine person so, probably he is not joking about meeting me. But, the behaviour he is potraying now is making me crazy... It hurts that he isn't replying to my text...

They're more like best friends than a couple but I think that's the best way to go about it... Why can't I have a relationship like that too? It's like having a childhood playmate and best friend, a sort of innocent relationship when I see them.

I can't seem to form friendships with guys properly... And it doesn't help that my faculty/couree is strongly female biased, with few guys and even fewer cute ones... Sorry yeah I might be lonely but, who are you kidding, looks are a factor too you know.

Just so jealous of her. Oh well to each their own right? Maybe someday I'll have something like that too.

Like, whatever the dynamic of our relationship is; be it friends with benefits or a serious relationship, I believe I deserve the respect of being told what the issue or situation is so that I know that I no longer have to wait for you or expect anything from the other party. I end up blaming myself and constantly questioning what happened or where everything went wrong... To be honest, I know that I'm considered way above average in terms of looks and as a result I often get used as a sex toy or as a trophy to show off. I just get discarded after. I don't know where to find someone who wants something deep and genuine with me and I don't quite know why but it hurts. Am I boring or something lol. I work as hard as I can at the relationships that I have and at my work and talents and I try to make everything perfect but just nothing, NOTHING can make anyone stay. The moment I fall in love, they leave or they cheat and I don't mean to be rude but I've seen some of the girls I've been cheated on with and I can't help but wonder what they have that I don't. It makes me second guess myself and I can feel my confidence slipping away more and more everytime this happens. Does any one know why this happens? Any advice?

He made the first move and said that he likes me more than a friend but also said that we have different plans and paths in life as his life is somewhere else and my life is in Singapore. We have never confessed to each other that we love each other in a bf-gf way, though we talk like we are already dating. We cry together, we laugh together and now I am in love.

We talked, on one hand I know it's beyond hopeless to get her back. She told me I am just too emotional to not be able to see that our relationship is toxic. As I look back, I really disagree. We had our overwhelmingly good times. She just could not see it. You were the one who told me all couples had fights. You give up way too soon. 3 years packed with memory going down the drain.

Oh how I wish I knew about this. You don't know how much I am willing to change for you. For all the happiness that you have ever brought me. I can say for sure you are well worth it. Another chance at love please..

I've thought it over and decided that it would be good to talk to my bf about it, and so I'll be doing that and we'll see how things go.

While I can understand that you don't want to know anyone else that's had sex with your partner, I don't think that it's reasonable not to even talk about sex at all and flip out whenever it comes up. I mean anytime it comes up, not even talking about our pasts.

1345,"Sorry guys, I need to rant and get this off my chest. I don't know what's up with loyalty nowadays because there seems to be a real lack of it. Either that or I have been extremely unlucky. 

So I found out my ex cheated on me when she recently went on exchange. I tried to forgive her, gave her a second chance, only to find out she got involved with more guys again later on. Imagine a hot knife being slowly driven down your back with a good ol twist at the end. So I wanted to know what really happened and what I did wrong but all I got were inconsistent stories where I found out she was actually omitting and twisting the facts. 

I even found out after that that she was lying to me all along about her previous infidelity and that she had actually cheated on her ex too, which honestly would have changed my mind about getting together with her in the first place. Looking back, I still remember the way she used to tell me about how she ""valued"" honesty and transparency, as if to distract me or divert my suspicions away from her. 

I finally left her but with all the lies I've been fed, I really don't know what to believe anymore. She loves to flirt with other guys (even when I'm physically standing next to her) and I wouldn't be surprised if there were more third parties involved. 

Tbh I had a strong feeling something was wrong from the beginning(and throughout) and I beat myself all the time for not acting on my suspicions and leaving her earlier. Till today I struggle with trusting and being vulnerable with people around me, even those with genuine intentions to help. I just hope that it'll get better and I find proper closure one day.

1346,"OP of #46692 here. For those who are lazy to click, here's what I posted last time:

""Had a secondary school gathering the other day met the girl who was my first love. After the gathering we shared a cab home since we live around the same area. 

The short 20 min ride was an emotional rollercoaster (no pun intended) for me. It reminded me of the reason why I was completely attracted to her back then. At the same time it reminded me of why we didn't, and would never have worked out.

We're still on talking terms and in fact is planning for a trip for this group of secondary school friends at the end of the year. But I guess that bittersweet feeling I get when I'm around her would never go away. ""

During the trip, there was this moment when two of us were alone. Somehow the conversation topic came to our past relationship, how we got together, how we broke up etc. It was then I asked : 

""Would we have worked out if both of us were more mature?""

She didn't reply at the moment. And I decided not to pursue the topic.

At the end of the trip we shared a cab home from the airport again since we live in the same area. We didn't talk much during the ride. Just when she's about to alight she said: 

""I guess we'll never know unless we try.""

Fast forward a couple of months to today: We are happily attached and the appears to be going strong.  Idk how far we'll go this time. I'm just grateful that we're given a second chance. I'll treasure this and hopefully take her down the aisle this time. 

For all those troubled by love out there: Not everyone will get a second chance like us. If you really love your other half, treasure them.

1348,"I'm a relatively fresh NUS graduate, just wanted to ask what's the opinion on dating an intern at the workplace?

Just to give some context (and keeping it deliberately vague for obvious reasons), my company hires interns from NUS on quite a frequent basis. In all honestly, I wasn't really looking for anything, and in fact I treat most of them as friends only. However, there's this particular intern who slowly grew on me; maybe it's because of common topics as we had the same major, or just her friendly demeanor, or that she's super capable, or that she looks so cute when she smiles, idk. Anyway I feel like I'm falling for her bit by bit. Biggest problem is that I don't know if it's even appropriate, and I don't want to be seen as the creep/fucboi who preys on interns, though our age gap isn't that big (I'm still a fresh grad after all). Somehow I get this guilty conscience / conflict of interest feeling as after all, I am still sort of her ""superior"", and I don't want any misunderstanding to arise from all this.

Am still trying to stay as detached as I can so I don't crash too badly if things don't work out, but does anyone have any advice? Or perhaps used to be in the same situation?

1349,"Hi, just asking for advice. I hooked up with this guy a couple of times over tinder and we're on quite good terms. The main problem is that we've since gotten attached and my boyfriend has an issue with me seeing my exes, which I don't have an issue with since I haven't talked to any of them in like, 3 years. The question is whether I should stop talking to this past hookup of mine, let's call him A, in case my bf finds out about our history and sees an issue with it?

I can't raise the question to my bf since he's very clearly stated that he doesn't care and doesn't want to know about what went on before we got together, and so I've never really told him anything about my past. So well, I can't really ask him, and he's been really firm on not wanting to know... rather aggressive on the point that he doesn't like me hanging out with people I've had sex with before. While I understand that point, I'm kinda offended at the assumption?

I honestly don't think that it will ever come out, since pretty much only me and A know about it, and seeing as both of us are attached we're not about to tell anyone about it anyway, and it's not like my bf will look through my phone to find out about it, and I'm not even sure it's in my chat history anymore.

Just some context about A, he's not exactly a close friend that I see every day, but he's someone I'd say hi to when I see him. We haven't caught up, and I don't go out to see him one on one or anything. I do sometimes reply to his instastories, but he rarely posts anymore, so that's been a while too. I just see him around my faculty when he walks over for his electives and we do a quick hi-bye kinda thing. I don't have feelings for him and I'm more than certain he doesn't have any too. I'll be completely okay with cutting him off.

Thing is, I think my bf has an issue with me and my exes/hookups/past whatever because he thinks that when I meet someone I've hooked up with or had sex with in the past, I'd be reminded that we had sex... or like assumes that somehow I'd want to have sex with them again or something. I'm not that kinda person, I mean, that's kinda demeaning right? So I've been kinda thinking to talk to my bf about it, but my bf clearly doesn't want to talk about it.

So I'm just asking the guys here, if you see some girl you've hooked up with in the past, say a couple of years back, is the sex the first thing that comes to mind?

TL;DR, I have issues with my bf's demands on a motivational level, no issue with doing what is asked, but have problems with his assumptions for making the demand of me.

Sorry for long post, but I don't have a potato.

My boyfriend's fine, we've been dating about 2 years too. He's not very good looking, and I don't know if I'm okay with it, but that's not the biggest problem. The real problem is actually quite small, really.

Thing is, he tries hard to maintain the idea that he's good at sex, but he's not all that good. He's had maybe quite a bit of experience, but he just doesn't make the cut. He just doesn't know how to please a lady I guess.

To make things worse for him, his little brother is really quite small. I read somewhere that the Singapore average is about 4.5? He's definitely not near that length, though he tries hard to. He says it's the lower body fats concealing it, but honestly, he's not fat. He's literally got almost no fat.

So well... to quote your question, recently I have been re-questioning my feelings for him because I feel like he's not attractive enough. He's ""shorter"" than the average guy, and doesn't have killer looks nor body. I feel selfish thinking this way, but I can't help it. Should I leave him?

I dont want to seem that I am too controlling over her, so I let her wear what she wants provided I'm with her or if she would go home early. But I find myself still being uncomfortable with some of her outfits but I don't have the heart to keep rejecting her. Is there something I could do for us?

You knew from the start they're seeing someone else.
It didn't matter to you; they were just a friend you saw in tutorial. Every week, you walk into class and settle down next to them.
It starts out just focusing on work-related things. How to solve this and that tutorial question. Almost business-like. But soon you find common interests. Soon you find them laughing, and they're making you laugh too. Soon you find a friend you can trust.
And it goes on. You start looking forward to these tutorials every week. Just that 1 hour of class that used to be so boring has become so entertaining, so exciting -- it's now the highlight of your week. It's not so much the content, but the time spent with them. Perhaps you even muster the courage to ask them out for meals, and to study together outside of class.
And then comes the fall.
Their smile, their voice, their humour, their mindset, their reactions, their outlook on life. You fall for every detail. And it's a deep fall. You want to spend every day with this person, you want to go through life's ups and downs with them. You know you complement each other well. They match your needs and you match theirs perfectly. It's like a fairy tale dream come true.
But remember;
You knew from the start they're seeing someone else.
Unrequited love is the saddest love story.

I was taking bus 983 and just thinking about life when I saw this girl sitting opposite me also obviously zoning out. With her long hair and the setting sun falling over half her face I could not help but keep staring. She was listening to music on her headphones but I noticed she did not touch her phone or even carry a bag. How cool is that in modern society? 
I must have stared at her for about 10minutes and she must have definitely sensed it because our eyes met. And for that brief second I felt like she was looking into my soul. My face was burning but I could not tear my eyes away even as she gave me one last glance and looked back out the window.
I wanted so desperately to approach her but while I was gathering my courage she stood up. I could only watch as she dropped at the 801C bus stop at Keat Hong and walked out of my life. 
I am so conflicted now. I still love my girlfriend and I think I should get her back? I know that we are compatible enough. But I think I might have just missed my soulmate...

I wanted to tell him when the semester ended, but my insecurity got in the way. He got that cute smile, muscular build, and a much fairer skin tone than mine. This sounded shitty to write out loud, but I kept wondering if I was beautiful enough for him.

I noticed him having dinner alone yesterday and joined him. We caught up and talked about personal stuff for the first time. He jokingly said he wanted to ask me out but somehow thought I had a boyfriend as I posted a lot of pics with my brother on Instagram. I was speechless.

I just broke up with my gf of 4 years. Throughout these 4 years we had some of the best times of our lives. She was obviously the more experienced one in the relationship. Before me, she dated close to about 10 other guys but none lasted more than 7 months. I was the innocent boy who were madly in love with her. I didn’t know what love was supposed to be or even how to be a good boyfriend. The only thing I know was to give my best. 

When she graduated jc with a less than stellar result and couldn’t get into a local university, I took time to search every private university in Singapore collecting the pros and cons of each and everyone of them to help her make her decisions.

When I saw her phone screen protector cracked or her phone cable becoming wonky, I would not even think twice and buy it and replace it for her.

I would also wake up early just to cook her breakfast every time she stays over. 

To me, I will always would put her first, think about her needs and always try to make her happy. But right now I am lying in my bed sobbing over this break up. 

I dont want to get back together with her because I know we will not workout. I want to get over this and move on with my life. But I can’t help to think that because I am so hurt over this break up, will I ever be able to love someone as much I as I used to love her? Will I grow skeptical of love?

There was an instance where we were out with friends and we all split the bill, I discreetly asked her to lend me her credit card so I could pay and not look bad because I didn't have money. She didn't want to and just paid for me nd her share. Do you know how embarrassing it was for me? That night we got into an argument and she told me to get a job if I didn't want this to happen. She doesn't even understand that I'm waiting for the best job opportunity.

Whenever she shower, I will check her phone and I've seen her conversation with friends where they told her to find a better boyfriend. she just replied with ""haha no la"". She didn't even defend me??? She didn't even type some of my pros. 

Another thing is I've tried to ask her to resign because I don't think it's nice for her to be better than me. She should let me have a job first and my position should be higher than hers. If not I will look inferior to her. She was also really upset and I feel like she is not sensitive to my feelings at all.

I've asked her many times if we should get married or do bto but she has kept saying ""never mind la take it slow"" and I feel like she's not serious about us.

1400,"Reply to Confession #58979

If you and your partner are roughly of the same age and earning the same income. I feel that it is a much better decision to make it fair 50:50 rather than getting the Male to pay more just because of social hierarchy. This is because your relationship will be a long term one and starting 'unfair' might become a source of conflict in the future which is something that you definitely want to avoid. But to be fair, I do not know of your situation and I do acknowledge some of the situation that might be alright to split 70:30 or 60:40.

1. Ask yourself this question, what are you going to use the rest of the money for when your partner pay more for the 'bigger items'? If it's personal items, assuming that male and female has the same basic necessities, aren't you just being unfair to him?
If you're using it under circumstances such as dental treatment, funding your little brother's school, etc (case on case basis) then you might want to talk to your partner to a certain agreement, but do be honest and remember that not all reason are actually 'valid'. Example is if you say you are funding your parents vacation, he also have parents and the arrangement will become unfair to his parents. So... the point is, really think through what are you going to use the rest of the money for before bringing this up to an 'unbalanced' arrangement.

2. What's the dynamic of your 'smaller items' payment? If it's all based on 50:50, I don't see why you should push the bigger items to other ratio. But if you have the tendency to pay for smaller items, let's say you cover electricity bill, dinner  etc. Then maybe it's actually alright because in the end it will be approximately 50:50 for what is covered by both of you~ 

3. If the guy is really okay with any arrangement, who am I to say? What I want to say though, a lot of couples went through this phase when the guys would not mind paying more for the girls and again, consider what will happen in the future. Based on your dynamics, can it be the reason for a crack in your future relationship?

Do take note that they're my opinion and I might miss some other possible cases. In the end, it really depends on you and your partner. I wish you all the best in your relationship~

1404,"Dear guys out there, I am in need of serious advice.

I am currently 30, and I met a guy who works as a financial advisor in his mid 30s, which I assumed he should be either 37 or 38 this year. Basically, I am his client, and we met a few months back.

We started off just purely business. One day when we were scheduled to meet, something happened at home, so I had to reschedule the meeting. And that lead us to a conversation. I am actually kind of confused by the signals he sent because I know I started falling for him (a few months later). Please correct me if I am wrong.

1. Why would someone spend time chatting with a client? Its like almost everyday. This continued for some time, then we stopped messaging daily, and I try not to send him messages. Even now, he still send me messages every few days to check on my life.

2. We go out on random dinner/lunch dates. We just set a date to exercise together.

3. One night I told him I missed him, and he said it will be irrational if he missed me. It was quite late that night and he drove to my place and we hang out the whole night with some heart to heart talk. He said he is still single because he didn't want commitment.

4. When something happened at my home, he came over, and sent me to places (which kind of warm my heart)

5. He stays alone. He doesn't invite me to his place, but he self invited himself to my place by saying ""occasionally he can stay over at my place if my family is not around"". 

I mean, I try to be rational and not think too much into it or read between the lines, but his actions are kind of confusing to me. I know I am definitely interested in him, and I feel he that he is too. But he says he doesn't want commitment, and if that is so, why does he still keep sending mixed signals? Should I ask him upfront what he wants?

I couldn't be waiting infinitely if he doesn't want to commit right? Even though on many levels, we definitely click well. I certainly won't mind spending time to get to know each other better at this stage if he has feelings. I feel that the feeling is both mutual, just that I am unsure how to proceed from here.

1409,"I wanted to move on very long, but after what #59073 has written, it evoked my memories once more. TLDR, I am just a jerk who would like to thank someone who once appeared in my life and taught me to be a better person.

Hi F, I am not sure if you would be reading this, since I got to know you while I was exchanging and you probably wouldn't follow this page. I was not looking for a relationship prior to this and most of my encounters with other girls ended after a few lukewarm exchanges, until you showed up. 

Despite my carefree personality, I am a totally different person when it comes to work. Literally no smiles, dull and often the epitome of looking resentful. It was only I met you when I told myself I will be ready to settle and be less carefree, even if it means my lifestyle would change and I might have to relocate. Through my exchanges with you, I got to know you better. 

Through some misunderstanding, we drifted apart. I remember you for calling me over-sensitive when I try to break the ice with you once more. And I broke your trust by telling things that you confided in me because you trusted me. I am sorry for breaking that trust. It was you who thought me what is trivial to me may be important to someone else and it could well be a secret that is not meant for others to know, not even our mutual close friends. Subsequently another round of argument because of other things made me resolute that our friendship was gone, let alone for that slight possibility of romance which might have developed. 

You warmed up to me after that, all of a sudden. I remember I wasn't responding to the hints you made, repeatedly the whole night while we were out wth our friends. It must have been hard and embarrass for you to give so many hints and it's so obvious that our friends around us would have gotten it. Even after that night, you tried to talk to me, but I started drawing boundaries - replying less frequently, deciding to hang out lesser with you and probably you could feel that I wasn't as warm as I was to you prior to that. You continued to follow my IG stories and my posts and I knew that. I just don't know how to approach you and what were you after. I was just so sure that I might not be the one for you after all and our interactions just went to as good as zero.

Now that I am back home and whenever I play truth or dare, or when I have downed some alcohol, I will try to tell myself to not share with anyone this encounter. There are just too many ifs in the process. What if I did not share out what turned out to be your guarded secret? What if we warmed up to each other at the same time? What if I actually come and speak to you despite whatever that happened? 

The worst part is just when I thought I have put behind this incident, I realised I didn't. Whenever I started to HTHT, whenever I drink, I will be regretting over my mistakes. I just couldn't find anyone that would made me change myself for her again. I think that I only have myself to blame ultimately. Yes, I am a jerk, an egoistic man, behind a front that appears mature.

I heard from my friend that you have started seeing someone. I hope that the person will treat you better than any of the guys you had. I just hope that the next time we meet again, we will be smiling at each other and we could become closer friends, if I may. 

Thank you for reading such a long post. I am not sure if this is what they meant by the first love, since we never really started. Btw F, thank you for enabling me to grow up and to be more sensitive to someone else's needs and wants. And for others out there, you just have to talk to the other person if you really want answers to your questions. Don't be a jerk like I once was.

I guess it's time to move on at last.

I rarely follow NUSWhispers unless they pop up on my feed. But recently there has been quite a number of confessions asking for relationship advice about their other half, more often then not begin by stating a few bad points/habits/behaviors of their SO.

The disgusting thing is that the typical replies are always a bunch of trolls asking for breakups, dumping their partner, 'he or she is not worth your time', 'better off without him/her'. Not pointing names because thats besides the point.

I mean cmon, in our parents good ol days era, when relationships break down, they communicate, mediate and fix them. Stop treating your relationship as if you're waiting to hop on the next ship then swings by.

TLDR - Talk to your partners, dont give up on your love ones so easily if you truely love them in the first place.

Have a nice day.

1411,"Hi
I am with my gf 2 years now and counting, and I really love her a lot. However, the problem is that she don't like it when I go out with friends, especially girls (I understand why but it is just having a meal thats all). I like hanging out with my friends, and sometimes I have the urge to lie to her so that I can hang out with them. However, the guilt of lying to her will consume me and I don't want to lie to someone I consider having a future with. I really love her and I don't wish to lose her but at the same time I don't like that she will be upset when I meet up with my friends. What should I do?

1413,"Hi all, looking for an advice here..

I and my bf are in ldr rn. He goes to NUS and I go to another overseas uni. We’re both aren’t Singaporean and we’ve been best friends ever since our high school days. We just got to be more than that last year, after being bffs for around 3 years. So I can safely say I know him quite well by now.

He’s always been that smart competitive guy even since our HS days, being in the top 5 of his class, and also got accepted to NUS (which is kinda a big deal back in our home country). He’s now an engineering student with a high CAP (read: FCH) and also managing quite a lot of CCAs. Despite that, he still tries to make time to call me at night (ldr problems) even when he has midterms coming etcetc.

However, lately I’ve been feeling like things change. Majority of our talks now is him talking nonstop abt internships and his friends actually getting an internship here and there achieving this and that, with me just listening to him talk for hours. I’m suppotive of him and his dreams, but I just can’t help feeling like we’re moving at a different pace and that I just couldn’t keep up with him. Here where I study, the life is more laid back (?) and ppl do talk abt jobs and internships etc but the intensity is just so different from what I hear it’s like there in Singapore (he told me that everyday he would be talking abt internships with his friends).

Now it feels like I’m more like his ‘job consultant’ rather than a gf, where mostly he talks abt is work and that he asks for my advice in addressing certain issues. He doesn’t actually talk abt things ‘normal couples’ would  talk abt. I don’t mind listening to him talk abt his internships etc however I just think that it shouldn’t take up like 70% of everything that we talk abt. I know that we’re still young and being ambitious is a good thing that will get you far, however I can’t help but feel pressured by all these talk abt work. I’ve been way more stressed lately due to his ‘talks’, since even tho he didn’t explicitly say this,  the “if you’re not able to be in the same level as me, then you’re not that worthy” kind of feeling he gives me just pressurize me much. 

He already gets the internship from this relatively big company, but he still says that he want to get an inten from this super big company. He’s the kind of guy that thinks if someone else can do something, so can he. His level of competitiveness scare me sometimes. He also ask me to just work in Singapore after I graduate this year (as if it’s that easy lol) so that we don’t have to be in ldr but seeing him like that makes me hesitant abt the potential super stressful life I’ll be in if I were to work there. He’s always talking abt being a CEO will get you lots of $$ etcetc but tbh I’m not the kind of person that actually wants a life so full of riches but having my SO work almost 24/7 and not able to spend time with me. Smh. Idk but  being with him makes me feel small and unworthy. 

 I always hear that Singapore life is competitive but is it really that bad that all 2nd yr uni ppl talk abt with their friends is mostly internships and work? He’s actually of the same age as me but I’ll be graduating earlier than him and hopefully start work earlier as well. Will this issues be any better once I start being in the work force?

Thoughts regarding this matter? He wasn’t this crazy up until the mid of last year and I don’t know how long I can keep up with all this stress from being with him ☹️ He’s actually a very kind person and I know he loves me too, we just clicked so well during our HS days up until his 1st year in NUS, then he just somehow transformed into this ambi guy I don’t recognize. I don’t want to breakup with him just bcs of this but I can’t actually feel happy if I were to be in a long term relationship with someone that’s too ambitious. It just feels like he’s no longer the boyfriend and bff I used to know that shares the same vision as me.

I already tried talking to him regarding this matter. He said he’s going to lessen the work talks, but after a week or so at most he’s just back to this super ambi boy mode. Sigh.

And for K if you somehow reads this,
really, I miss those old days that I can talk to you abt anything at anytime, not just me here trying so hard to impress you just to be able to feel worthy for you. I was happy with you back then, where did all those happiness go?

My relationships have not worked out well since I am unable to trust people or become close to them. People are asking me when I am going to get married since I am in my late 20s now. If I were to get married, that would not only be a disaster for me, but it will also be a disaster for my future spouse, and any future children that I may have - since they will suffer from my lack of emotional availability. Why pressure someone to get married when that person knows it will not be suitable for them?

When people read this, they will probably think: ""Well, don't get married then."" Except that is not straightforward in a society where unmarried people are marginalised.

The longer we've been together, the more I wonder what she saw in me. It makes me really insecure, and affects my self esteem. She seems to have noticed this and she is constantly reassuring her love for me.

1418,"To the commenters of #59672 regarding the question of whether guys will be intimidated by a girl from the most elite course. As to your question, I would consider myself to be above average looks, getting picked up by strangers for random purpose on the street, having people confessed and having a couple of boyfriends in my life. So I would not say I am unattractive. My concern is that being an elite person in both acads and looks, I genuinely wonder if it will intimidate guys in general because I have been socialising for a bit and wonder if anything serious will come out of it besides people merely praising me or hitting on me. Firstly, I am definitely not arrogant but nature but I am definitely aware of how being in an elite course has subjected me to be shunned by some people who only seem to focus on my identity as that. My friend has brought that issue to my attention which is why I am seeking advice from you all here, not for you all to criticise that I am being arrogant or so. I do not deny I recognise this privilege and I am just concerned what others may think. If I were that arrogant, I would post this non anonymously or ask people in my life directly rather than sieve through anonymous opinions here. I am genuinely asking if guys will be intimated or withdraw in some sense.

Hey #59677 , this is coming from a guy whos going for exchange soon. I also have a girl which I like but I honestly don't think I'll tell her about it before I leave. Chances are that you are probably not the same girl I have in mind, but just let me pretend as if you were her.

I really like you too, to the point that receiving wa messages from you will make my entire day. But I probably won't be confessing to you in person. Cos while I know that we are close, I don't know what you think of me. Am I special to you? Or am I just another one of your close guy friend, like the other one you often hang out with? 

I had a close friend which I liked back in JC as well. But when I confessed to her, things didnt turn out well and I lost her even as a friend. Because of this I am still afraid to confess to you because I'm afraid to lose the status quo. If anything, I dont mind being your friend for a little longer.

I wish we could get even closer, find more excuses to hang out together, so I can know for sure that you are interested in me as I am in you, especially in the upcoming sem break before I leave for SEP. Once I establish that we are mutually interested in each other. I will definitely confess to you. If not, I'll probably keep my feelings to myself.

@#59677, I wish the best to both of us. Hope he'll make his move soon! ;)

1422,"My boyfriends take forever to reply messages, for example, maybe 3 days to just reply to one WhatsApp. The longest he went without texting or replying me is probably 10 over days, before his fyp submission deadline. I mean, I can understand that cos it's probably a very busy and stress period. But I think he might be losing interest or that he's just taking me for granted like you know how some guys just wants the chase and not want to be responsible for the relationship after. When we started dating, he's very quick with his replies like we can have proper conversations over text and now we would just text each other to ask where and when we would be meeting. It'll usually be me asking if we're meeting on this day, where and what time, and he'll take maybe a couple of days to reply (which is usually the night before we meet)  and the cycle repeats. Now that I've said it, it kind of reminds me of business policies of needing a couple of business days to process lol. 

Anyway I talked to him about it, but he just brushes it off in a not-so-serious tone and saying how he hates using his phone and all. It is true that he doesn't uses his phone when we go out and there will be tons of unopened notifications from his friends. I guess I'll be trying to talk to him this for the last time and hope that maybe we can either come to a compromise in some way (since we've been together for almost a year now) or... maybe it's for the best to end things early to spare us from further pain in the future. 

Anyone has been in the same situation and can offer some advice for how to talk about such problems face to face? I've tried, but the thing is I'm very happy to see him every time we meet so it's tough for me to talk about it and he's really nice and considerate towards me when we meet up? But then, the lack of texting is just too much.

1423,"Hi everyone, I'm hoping to use this platform to gain some relationship advice. I've been in a relationship for close to 3 years now, and I'm wondering... Does your other half ever end up changing his/her bad habits for your sake despite you repeatedly talking to him/her about it? These bad habits are ones that I feel like it's really tough for me to tolerate and despite talking to him about it, arguing with him about it, he is perpetually telling me ""I understand"", but nothing ever seems to change. It got me thinking, could I be expecting too much out of him? 

These bad habits include: 
• Firstly, his lack of effort in interacting with my parents when he comes over to my place. He simply says hi to both of them, showers, then stays in my room the whole day. Or when my parents fetches him home, he doesn't even bother to make small talk with them in the car... And for me, I feel like that is quite disrespectful. I think being an ''introvert'' is not an excuse at all, because I also do make an effort to make small talk with his parents, buy food for his parents when I go over to his place. So for me, I can't quite understand why he just can't do the same for me.
• Secondly, we are taking a few classes together so naturally, we decided to be in the same project groups. However, he hasn't been doing much work at all for these projects that we are together, just physically appearing for meetings while he focuses his time on projects from other modules. I am also taking other modules in this semester, but I still believe in doing my best for all projects across all modules. Honestly, I'm just perplexed as to why he thinks that by doing projects with me, it gives him the leeway to relax and focus his time on projects for other modules... 
• Thirdly, his actions constantly contradicts what he tells me. Every now and then, he likes to tell me that a relationship is all about giving 100% from both parties, and that he truly loves me a lot. Yet, he also expects me to just throw aside whatever I feel (such as stress from the semester) to be there for him, throw aside whatever work I have to help him with his work and so on. I feel that I have been just giving, and not receiving at all throughout this relationship. I know it's an unhealthy mindset to have but at the same time, I can't just keep giving but not receiving because when I talk to him now, I feel so exhausted and drained. I used to look forward to his text messages but not anymore.

And to be honest, I am just touching the tip of the iceberg with these few bad habits which I feel like I can't tolerate (anyone feel me?). Other things include how he's always tardy with repaying me (the money just accumulates), his inability to understand my frustration (oh I've tried scolding, talking nicely, discussing.. None works - he just tells me he understands and proceeds to do the exact same mistake the next week) and so on. I feel really drained, and at this point in time I'm just wondering if I should just end the relationship. It would be great if you can share with me your advice, thanks everyone!

1426,"It's not mother's day yet but i realised that ladies esp mothers shld be appreciated more.

I really appreciate my mom. Why? This is because she carried the infant me in her belly for 9 months. And every mom did the same for everyone who is reading this post.

You see, she carries you for 9 months, she may have to sacrifice her full time job to take care of you, and let her body to rest etc (There's a long list). The sacrifices they have made is really tremendous & very Respectful.

Besides sacrificing, there are so much emotional swings & insecurities they face. Sadly, there are some moms who are left to take care of their infant alone (as boyfriend/hubby doesn't want to take responsibility)

I grew up with both of my parents often in long cold wars. Like can last up to 6 months or longer. prob 8 months. And every time they argue, i got frightened. (In some cases, couples may be violent to each other too)

Over the years, if your mom chose to be the homemaker, she has really done alot of stuff (ie. cooking, cleaning up, washing, ironing, marketing etc etc).

Tbh, i've never learnt how to wash my clothes/hang my clothes to dry etc.. i just feel indebted to her. I'm alrdy 22. Yes, it's time for me to learn and take on more responsibility. 

Right now, she's almost retiring from her part time job, and I hope can be more responsible for her and myself and take care of her when she is in her golden years. I know money can't buy everything (i.e i bought birdnest on bdays etc) I need to be obedient and responsible so that she doesnt need to worry about me anymore (they showed so much concern when you were a baby till now..)

Which is why some people say, find your partner who shares similar traits to your mom. Because of her sacrifices, her effort to love you, her constant worry etc have made you who you are today. Just like how your partner can potentially change you for the better. Someone who will always be there for you.

The way my dad ""treated"" my mom in the past was really harsh that I shed tears on certain arguments. And i really wanted to protect my mom at that time but i couldn't because i was just a child. Hence, growing up i promised to protect her. 

Ps. my parents are more loving now, cold wars don't happen so frequent now, once in awhile and it lasts at most 1 week? I'm kinda glad. 

I promised myself, that if i were to find a partner, i make sure that i love her wholeheartedly. Besides giving her a comfortable life, but also to appreciate her. 

I hope that this post would justify on why i think mothers shld be appreciated more. And guys shld treat their girlfriend better, because can you imagine they will go through so much in their life, longer than the 2 years we served. I promised myself, never let my future girlfriend  to go through this situation.

1428,"Regarding those who mentioned about dating same age or younger, I am a lady, dating a guy 5 years younger than me (he is in early 20s and im im late 20s). 

I was really skeptical about it because the age difference is really too huge, felt like im gonna baby sit him. Also partly because i have dated same age and one year younger who are super immature when it comes to dating. But I was wrong, age is just a number. I guess it's the experiences we went through in our lives respectively that can allow us to be connected. If i were to date someone older but has been a prince the whole life who cant eat kopitiam food, does it mean that the relationship will turn out to be better? No. Thats why, age really doesnt matter. 

So we have been dating for 3 years and my pay is at least 2 times of his. He never knew and he never asked. He mentioned that it doesnt change the way he gonna love and dote on me even if I receive better education than him or receiving higher pay than him. He still wants to pay for small little things when we are out, and i would do vice versa. We dont argue about money. 

I was so afraid that someone younger and prettier may appear and cause the downfall of the relationship, but i literally think too much because he was also afraid someone handsome and more mature appear would take me away from him. We reassured each other from time to time to keep our relationship strong. 

To be honest, ever since we started dating, i actually forgotten that he is younger than me. All i know is im in love with someone i want to spend my life with, and nothijg else matters anymore. 

We both invested our time and effort in something and someone we know its gonna last for life. 

So now, he has popped the question during our 3rd year anniversary and we are looking at a simple wedding will do. 

Before meeting him, i always tell everyone i will never date someone younger, but i guess life is making me a fool for being too sure about something uncertain - the future.

1442,"Hey admin, it’s the OP from #59224. Didn’t thought there are so many threads following smart girl post!! (Trying not to sound emotional, using 3rd person narrative below) 
Thank you all for listening to my story. The OP has been happily attached and has quite a lot of friends around her, she clicks well with those who shares the same passion or those she admires. To answer some of your questions, she is taking care of her appearance well as she was in charge of CCA fashion design department back in old school. 
However, she feels that sometimes there are definitely drawbacks for being unique, like many people can feel connection with you, but you can only connect with so few. She can speak a few languages, but it is very difficult for people to get a full picture of what she is thinking. She’s never a member of a girl clique either, due to skewed boy to girl ratio in her course and she’s more or less raised up like a guy, interested in history and maths. That fail in connection and constant losing interest in things other people like led her to negative thoughts and she was once keen to read through lots of  psychology books to find what was wrong with her mind. The reason why she said she could not be popular is that she could not keep small talks going.
She’s not perceived as the hardworking type either, but that is exactly what she was talking about. She’s seen girls who asked for help and attention given more credits than those who worked hard and chasing their own dreams, where hardworking and competency are definitely redeeming qualities!! She thinks it is a social phenomenon here (Asia in general) and wants to call out. As she admires smart and attractive females depicted in foreign literatures (Irene Adler for example) and she thinks competent females more widely accepted overseas. 
She just doesn’t want to be alone .

But recently, I finally fell in love again. It's with someone who is totallt different from my ""ideal boyfriend"" description that i shared with everyone whenever they asked me qhat do I look for in my future boyfriend. 

I realised I think too much about wanting to fall in love again that I felt so pathetic when I cant find love. But the truth is, the right person just has not appear yet. It takes time, opportunity and fate to meet the one who will make you fall in love all over again. 

So for those who are still single, stop trying too hard to look for it. Stop over thinking ""does he likes me?"" ""Do i love him?"". Instead, go for it if you feel that thats the one for you. If you never try, you will never know. 

I tried so hard to ""create"" fate by swiping on apps and chat with new people, but eventually, the one i fell in love, is not the one i swipe, its someone who walked passed me on a random afternoon. 

Im finally in love, like been so so so long i felt this way with any guy.

1462,"The Human Anxiety about Love and Lust with Castration as a Possible Solution (and a serving of a rant about my love life lol)

Amidst all these sex and relationship posts we see at least once everyday, I also can’t help feeling anxiety probably like the most of us, in one way or another. As such, at times, I really envy asexual or some religious people who don’t have the need to be desired and not having to satiate carnal needs. Other times I’d be jealous at chads and stacys who can have it their way.

All these hormones and the need to do our primal duty as living things has made me wonder what this angst is all about. I mean there are already so much of us humans around on earth and I do have the slightest thought of sexually castrating myself to rid of this anxiety and could probably help control the population as well, which I feel probably other people should have the slightest consideration to think about and we could do ourselves a favour from overpopulating this planet of limited resources.

It’s just a thought that lingers around time and again. I wonder if I would be much more of a productive human being and be happier if I had no libido whatsoever. However, at the same time, due to the need and urge to be loved, I’m scared and I don’t want to do it also. I wonder if there’s also a temporary solution that might help my anxiety due to this “need” and experiment how life would be without this desire.

(You can skip the next part to the end if you don’t want to read my rant about my sad love life…)

My love life isn’t flourishing as what I dream it to be and wonder if I do get there, will my feelings change? Personally, I’m still kinda learning the ropes in dating and haven’t been in a serious relationship. Most of my few sexual experiences have been paid partnerships and I never had the luxury of having FWBs. I’m not particularly bad looking, but I have my limitations that do inhibit my sexual value, like my height, my racial/religious identity and mostly due to my cynical and passive personality. I do blame myself in not taking risks when I had my chances with girls, because I had been too nice and respectful. I can easily mingle with girls casually and things can go well really quickly. However, every time I will hit the wall with the intent of going to bed with each girl, as I had always been caught in a moral dilemma that I should be a gentleman, but if you want to play the game you must be the bad boy which I had always feared that might incriminate me or put me in a bad light among my friends. I probably just don’t know girls that much yet and I still need more practice to know when to do the “wrong” things at the right time, but I’m already getting tired of failing and fed up of being so close to home runs and harping over past failures. I had gotten advice telling me that I should just go for the moves anyway and try not to get caught and respect the girl if it goes too far. Just play it cool and move on if it fails. If I get rejected early on I can easily move on and on without it being a big deal.

I haven’t really given up yet, though I do get scared at the thought of falling into the category of an incel due to me cock-blocking myself by DLV-ing and giving girls the chance to say no (it’s their innate defensive mechanism). (If you’re trying to date, you should know these terms…) I hope the girl I’m chasing after now might cure or treat my anxiety, but I don’t know for sure. It might be a passing feeling, but I do know that due to carnal tendencies, I’ll always be insatiable to do the deed, whether alone or with someone. That’s why I’m still having this small thought of hormonal or sexual castration in my mind and be more productive in school, or life in general. I hate to admit that my pursuits and trying to perfect the game have affected my grades and social life. Maybe I don’t know what love is yet, so sex can be out of the picture? I should probably let nature take its course…

(End of love life rant)

Now I want to bring up and consider another point, and is kinda going off tangent, which might sound very radical and will offend some or most people, and it has been done in some countries. Pardon me if it is so, but I just want to know the general consensus.

Is it time for us to slow things down a bit as a species? We could probably stop all this complaining about lack of love and/or sex life and shit if we all just sexually lobotomise ourselves (maybe at least temporarily to try out) and strive to be more productive, with only the need to reproduce as a controlled maintenance of our species…

Is the traditional goal of life overrated and is it time for change? I’m just opening this up to an open discussion here. Haven’t thought about talking about this to anyone and decided and I want to share here discreetly for a start. It’s all a random blurb of my thoughts that I wanna let out and I welcome anything. (Not a philosophy student, but I prefer deeper concepts to address this situation in layman terms, if possible)

1467,"Sometime back I found out that my then bf (now ex) was cheating on me with a mutual friend. I later realised that on those nights when he claimed he was tired and after he said good night to me, he was actually out with the other girl. This went on for several months until my gut feeling told me something was amiss and I confronted him. He then admitted everything to me. 

Basically he blamed everything on the other girl and victimised himself saying that he was coerced into the illicit relationship because the other girl was very manipulative. When I asked for a breakup, he threatened to commit suicide because he said he cannot live without me. 

I insisted on ending the relationship but even months after the breakup, he still continued to loiter near my neighbourhood.

This level of emotional blackmailing and manipulation is the worst. I cannot comprehend how can people like him be so selfish as to cheat, while claiming that he still loves me very much. I am so thankful that I am no longer in this toxic relationship.

Cheating on your partner is a really selfish act and you cannot imagine the extent of hurt and damage you will cause. The endless cycle of asking myself why it happened, and even blaming myself for it when it is clearly his fault. Up till this day, sometimes I feel insecure and find it hard trust people.

There are always plenty of temptations around us but it is about making the conscious effort to keep choosing your gf/bf over others. It may be easy to fall in love, but maintaining a relationship is never easy; it requires commitment and lots of effort.

1472,"To #59224, 
I'd like to think that's Im somewhat in the same position as you, or at least I've had some similar experiences to what you mentioned. It hurts to not quite fit in with society's expectation of the ideal girl, or the people who look for that type of person. And accordingly it's harder for people like us to find friends/romantic partners. 

Something i ask myself often (and could help you too) is what the point of ""fitting in"" is. I admit to conforming to get what i want sometimes, like playing up the shy/confused girl stereotype to get help in class, but to keep up such an act in friendships or relationships is ultimately terrifying to me. Why would i want to have friends/a partner who i can't be real with all the time? So yeah, maybe i scare people away at times and it's a bit harder to make friends (most current close friends report their first impression of me as ""intense"" or ""unfriendly"") but I just treasure the few friendships i have. 

(And it's definitely possible to find a guy who respects your intelligence, or maybe even likes you for it. Don't settle for playing a ""perfect girlfriend"" for someone just to be in a relationship because you'll eventually get unhappy anyway.)

I found that my path had drifted away from most people, also from what society wanted me to be, as people always act very surprised when they heard my choice of degrees. 
Also, I feel that I can never be popular because people tend to like girls who needs help more than those who don’t (or even offers help) and most guys (or girls I put it here) don’t really like smart girls.

1491,"pretty interesting if you read #59037 and #59070 back-to-back... I've seen too many guys jump to the conclusion that girlfriends ""withhold sex"" from them bc those girls are evil villains trying to manipulate them, and totally these girls are cheating on them and having lots of sex with other guys. These are usually the sort of guys who also try hard to continuously pester and coerce their dates into constant sex. 

Sometimes, two people just have an incompatability when it comes to their sex drives. It doesnt mean the girl is cheating and ""withholding sex"", which btw is such a problematic term bc that's implying sex is some natural right you have and women must constantly give it to you. Their lower sex drive is not necessarily manipulation, and it's not necessarily cheating. 

Your gf doesn't owe you sex, and she isnt definitely having sex with hundreds of other men, bc have you considered that some people arent as desperately horny as you are? Maybe she was always low libido. Maybe it went down since she was younger. Maybe you dont wash your dick. Maybe she is turned off by your hyper-paranoid personality. Sit down and talk about it, you owe each other the benefit of the doubt, but no one owes anyone sex. Get over it.

1492,"I had feelings for a girl (let's name her A) but unfortunately she was already attached. Nonetheless we still hung out and became pretty close friends. After about 2 years I haven't fully ""gotten over"" A, and whenever she confides in me with regards to her relationship problems i secretly get a little excited... Logically speaking it would be unfair and mean to break them up, or to even wait for her. I thus tried my best to move on, and dated another girl (B). Although we have been dating for awhile, a little part of me still latches onto the hope that A's current relationship will fail in some way or another. I know I'm being unfair to B, but I just can't help control my feelings. Any advices?

1493,"I've been reading about the cheating sagas on this page and I thought I'd like to offer my inputs. I was in a relationship with my SO for 5 years since 16. Of course we had arguments here and there but they were nothing major, I loved him like my life depended on him. He made me feel complete, happy. But 4 years into our relationship, we argued more often, especially when I was unhappy with him speaking with his female best friend every day throughout our relationship. Long story short and I don't want to relive this memory anw, he cheated on me with her. I definitely had some fault to play towards the unfortunate end of the relationship and I tried salvaging things by trying to become a better girlfriend, friend and I took him back because everyone deserved a second chance. But the cheating episode has never been out of my mind ever since, it has been consuming me inside out. I got so insecure, worried that he'll hit her up again, worried about other girls, overthinking everything. I was on the brink of suicide and my CAP flew out of the window. I did go for UHC's counselling and I felt better, but I guess when someone cheats on you, thoughts of ""why wasn't I enough"" ""if he claimed to love me so much, how come he didn't think of me when he did it with her"" ""what could I have done that could have prevented this"" ""all those times when he said he was busy, was it with her"" etc etc never goes away and up till now I have so much of anxiety and negative feelings towards most things. Anyway, we broke up 8 months later because he felt it was unfair for me to continue in this toxic relationship that was eating me alive. Even though its been 2 years since we broke it off, I miss him very much and I constantly think back to what I could've done better. But then on most days I curse myself for being an idiot, for allowing him to ruin me. 

What was supposed to have been something sacred turned out to be my ultimate ruination and destroyed whatever notion I had of 'love'. So to all of you out there who think cheating is fine or are cheating rn as I type this, please consider the feelings of your SO and break it off with them beforehand, whether its a simple fetish or power play that you like. Is this some millennial thing to be cheating on each other? After this whole episode, I can't move on. It's still at the back of my mind and I've been trying so hard to move on and keep myself busy, but on worst nights its here to haunt me like his best friend. It's really difficult so I beg you guys to reconsider whatever you're doing. Cheating has long term repercussions not just on your SO, but on you as well. 

Ps sorry if this post sucks I'm trying not to relive past memories as I type this

1494,"My boyfriend says when he sees me, he can’t control himself. 

When he talks, he always manage to link the topic to sex/sexual things. Then he will ultimately says that he wants to have sex with me. He has tried to convince me to have safe sex but because my personal convictions, i always reject him.

As such, we have evolved to doing other kinds of intimate things to satisfy him. However, it is taking a toll on me emotionally as even though i would want to satisfy him and make him happy sexually, i think that is the role of me as a wife and not a girlfriend. I prefer a non-sexual premarital relationship. I also feel that in many instances he does not respect my body and wishes. I do appreciate that he loves me a lot (he is very nice to me) but sometimes i just feel that it is not a mature kind of love.

I have tried to talk to him but he views all my uncomfortableness in terms of our physical relationship as a source of sadness for him because he likes and wants to be physically intimate.

He also said that it is my role as his GF to satisfy him and when i don’t he will sulk and be unhappy.

What do you guys think i should do? Especially guys. I want to hear your opinion on this matter. Are we just not compatible? Is he expecting too much from me, or am i expecting too much from him?

1496,"To the OP of #58946

I for one understand you completely. The rationality behind our thoughts and feelings are completely unlike others, who are not in our situation, can understand. Firstly, I want you to know that your internal conflict is completely valid. Your feelings are your own and no one can berate you for it. 

Now, what can we do about it? You mentioned you don't see yourself marrying your current bf. Do consider this: Is this a result of your conflicted feelings for your new friend? Think hard about it and maybe you'll find more answers. These kind of soul-searching will take time. So don't pressure yourself to make such a hasty decision, only to regret it later. You'll only put yourself, and the people you love, through unnecessary pain. One other thing you should consider is, are you sure the feelings you're developing for your new friend are romantic feelings? Maybe you've fallen for the deep connection that you managed to build with him and not for the person. Then you might wonder, ""shouldn't I have such deep connections with my own bf and not someone else?"" well, you can think that way. But it's also possible to establish a connection this close with someone and not have a romance with them. The possibilities are limitless. Some people might think otherwise but, who says we have to fit what other people think?

Once you figured that out, I'm sure you'll be able to answer that question you have. I know it's a hard decision but I believe you can get through it. And remember, whenever you do decide to make that decision, own it. Own that decision. One day you'll look back and think ""maybe I should've done sth different"", but then remember that you did what YOU thought was best at that time. 

Ultimately, just slowly think through it. I'm personally still struggling, but I know my moral values. We can't always get what we want, but we can get somewhere close and still be happy. 

Wishing you all the best!

1501,"For about a decade now I have a rare condition that is called “Chronic pain” and mine has been described as particularly unfortunate, which I guess is just another way of saying bad. To put it simply, I experience pain which has no real cause. 

It started back when I was a teenager and it affects parts of my body randomly. Sometimes it’s just a light touch, other times I can’t even see straight. Prior to all of this for a decade I been doing martial arts and the suspicion is that something went wrong. Ironically due to the same martial arts I was actually quite accustomed to pain so I never really made a big mess out of it. The specialist that observed me even said that they are amazed by how well I tolerate pain.

I’m actually doing really well in my day to day life, I learned to hide in plain sight. I never tell anyone about it, I don’t want pity and frankly it mentally destroys people around you. Medicine doesn’t help either, it’s not like I haven’t tried, it’s just that after years of treatments I feel like there is nothing left to add.  

But there are times when pain overwhelms me. When I sit in the corner of my room unable to move, nights when I can’t sleep or mornings when I wake up completely wet from sweat. After moments like that, when pain shatters my mind, I often sit down in a shower and just wait until I am able to put myself back together. Although probably the most annoying part is when my legs start to hurt badly in public. Then I have to sit somewhere like an idiot being unable to walk and pretend that I’m just passing time. 

I’m probably writing this since another one of my relationships broke down and I’m feeling down about it. It was the same problem as usual – I’m insensitive. And I am, it’s just that from my perspective all these problems most people have seem so insignificant. Also, recently one of my exes, we remained friends, managed to stumble on me “passing time” virtually next to my apartment doors. She didn’t even ask what’s wrong, just sat there silently with me...

Nothing makes sense anymore and I’m feeling scared about it. I honestly don’t know how much more I can cope with this. It is so much harder than I thought it would be.

1510,"Been seeing a lot of posts and comments about how guys should never go for a party girl/ex-party girl and I can’t understand the stigma. 

I’m a party girl and I do hook up here and there, but that does not mean I have commitment issues or anything. In fact, I’d love to be in a committed relationship and give all of me to one guy. 

Maybe because I party very often, I only end up attracting guys who don’t want anything serious, or guys assume that I’m not looking for anything serious. I’m open to that too so I do go ahead with it if I like the guy, I mean I’m single so why not? But that doesn’t mean I wouldn’t want anything serious if it comes in my way. In fact, watching my friends who have boyfriends, I wish I could have something special with someone too. 

I party often because I love to dance, love the music, love dressing up and having a great time with my friends. So I don’t think me being a party girl should be reflective of how I would be in a relationship. I mean even if I am in a committed relationship, I do see myself going out to party just to enjoy the music and be with my friends. 

Really hope someday I can find someone who will look beyond my partying, because there is so much more to me than that. I hate to see it define me.

I am interested in one of my project groupmates. The project has ended and I have no idea how to proceed from here to know her better. Some options I have considered:

1)Talk to her about schoolwork, and proceed from there (I'm taking the module with some friends, so it's very odd to use this as a conversation starter.)

2)Random small talk (Also odd considering that I haven't talked to her for about 2 weeks or so.)

3) Go straight to the point : "" I think you're cute and I'd like to know you better."" ( Tried before on someone else, got her number, but didn't work out in the end)

Whatever I choose to do in the end, proceeding from then on is difficult because I'm horrible at chitchat. All my previous experiences failed because of that (At least thats what I think happened).

I met my current gf on an app and we got together as she was attracted to my qualities of being clean, hardworking and most importantly morally upright. She always held that impression of me until 2 months into my relationship, she changed upon certain old text messages in my phone of me soliciting services from prostitutes before I met her. She felt disgusted and cheated by my portrayed good boy image, and the worst of all, I transmitted a disease to her. Thankfully, we went to the doctor and realized that it was just a bacterial infection that spread, and we were both negative for other big sexual diseases. However, this did not make my act any more forgivable as she is an innocent girl who practiced abstinence and did not deserve to get any disease or feel unclean. Right now my relationship is in an awkward state where no words can regain her trust for me and despite her pressing desperately for a solution, I simply couldn’t provide. So to everyone out there, I guess my message to all of you is 1) when you decide to commit to your partner, make sure you come clean with your past and take actions to show responsibility. I.e. taking STDs testings etc. 2) For singles out there, I know it might be hard to control your urges, but abstain from visiting prostitutes or getting involved in any crazy hookup culture, because that moment of pleasure might lead to many more regrets and complications in the future. I am lucky to not get infected with any STDs but I am sure we cannot be lucky forever, as they can spread from skin to skin contacts, broken condoms and anything.

1528,"Came across several posts on ex-party girls, I'm just here to share my experience and this is in no way indicative of everyone. 4 years after graduating from NUS, I started dating my ex fiancee. My family is traditional and parents were anxious about my relationship. I also thought it was time to settle down as I have worked very hard in the past few years and my career has progressed well. Got to know her on cmb and continued dating. She was nice, bubbly, energetic and interesting while I have always been, I guess, the more boring one as I have always focused more on work. So it was really a great time for me dating her. We were both of age and the topic of marriage came onto the table pretty quick after a couple of months. She told me  she used to be wild when she was in college but she has since changed and wanted to find a good husband to form a stable family. I didn't really mind despite having never visited clubs and having grown up in a more traditional family. I mean, come on, it's a 21st century. And honestly, love is an interesting thing and the thought of embracing her despite whatever the past she has had made me felt we were closer and I didn't even bat an eyelid in saying ""I really don't mind"". A year after we started dating, we got engaged and we started to plan for weddings and everything. I did most of the work in the planning, also settling the house in the process. But things quickly went south a month before the actual wedding. Guess there were signs before that as I was doing most of the work for both of us. I noticed that she started going absent on chats for long periods of time and started working overtime more and more and couldn't be contacted during those time. It came to light when I noticed suspicious messages popping up on her phone when we were out for dinner. Questioned her about it, and she broke down, admitting that she cheated on me with one of her ex fwbs who came back to seduce her, meanwhile saying she felt lonely with me sometimes as I focused a lot on work and am not as interesting as other guys she had seen before. I asked her why she would still go on with me in that case since I have always been that way since the first day we met as I told her from the start that I have never been that much of an interesting person. She told me she was eager to find a good and stable guy to settle down as all her friends were settling down and she didn't want to be left behind, but she couldn't help but miss the fun she used to have. Sigh, it was a big mess and we are no longer together. I guess what I learnt from the whole experience was that, it doesn't quite matter what each other's past is. What matters more is once you made a decision to change, stick to it and put more effort into it. The issue is that people can change from good to bad or bad to good at the same time, loving someone just involves a lot of risks that is hard to be controlled. At the end of everything, I only wish everyone the best of luck in finding a partner who is sincere to you.

My bf and I have been together for 2 years now, however, my bf has been comparing me and his other friends girlfriends.

Recently, he saw on his Instagram story that one of his friend's girlfriend bought him a gucci wallet for valentines day and he showed it to me and said ""u see, other ppl gf buy gucci leh, u leh?"" don't get me wrong, I did bought him something, which was a pair of Nike slides he wanted. But he knows that I don't come from a wealthy family.

I’ve been a seasoned party girl, yes, I work hard and play hard. Living the temporary high life through music and drinks. Of course, I dance with friends and new friends alike, as long as they can dance with the groove. That’s about it. I get all the fun through good music, there are times it gets troublesome to block advances, but I drew the line. This is my party life and why do most think party girls are wild and definitely have fwbs and ons? Well, don’t be so narrow minded ????. 

Secondly, while Valentine’s Day is all about commercialism. Why don’t people take it as a chance to express love which one could possibly have taken other days for granted? It really depends whether your partner appreciate such opportunity. If nothing is said explicitly, then will gifting something on that very day (may not even be tangible or be of high value) hurt you? Are you afraid of being held in comparisons with other couple or are you afraid of showing your love to your partner? There’s a difference thinking practical and being thoughtful because imagine your other half have to look at her peers getting gifts and and answer why they have none? And of course, surely, if she loves you, she will justify for you.

1549,"Seeing all the posts from ""nice guys/girls"" on here, I thought I should write my own and see what you people think. 

I'm not a nice guy. 

I don't have a chiseled bod; what I have may best be described as average or dad-bod. I'm not Kpop boyband-level of handsome with my looks, but I'm the guy next door with that spark in his eyes and a small smirk curling on one side of his lips.

I have a checkered personal history and engaged in a lifestyle of hedonism and casual sex with multiple partners, both male and female and those in between. I was fully aware of what I was getting myself into, I valued the sexual lessons and practice I got from all those experiences, and throughout all those years of singlehood hedonism and player life I've made sure to keep myself safe and an eye on my sexual and physical health. Thankfully, I'm fine. The upshot of it all is that I can safely say I am very talented in more ways than one to pleasure my future partner in bed. 

I have a temper and I don't trust easy. But if you get my heart then what parts of it I have left is all yours, and yours only. I've no intentions of dating for the sake of it and loyalty/commitment is a non-negotiable criteria I hold myself and whoever I love/am loved by to. I cannot abide cheaters and I cannot abide serial daters, and God help any of my partners if I find out they are cheating on me because I don't give second chances and I will always have a Plan B to get my own back. I'm not good with pacifying girls with cute gestures and wheedling, but I'd like to think I'm the solid shoulder they can rest on when they need comfort most, as well as a strong set of arms to pick them up when they're down and need someone by their side. 

I'm not a nice guy. Not one of those guys from a Korean romance drama, or Augustus Waters from The Fault In Our Stars. 

I'm Liam Neeson from Taken. I'm Severus Snape from Harry Potter. I'm Tony Stark from the Marvel universe. I have a great deal of history and scars in my past. I'm not perfect. But I'm real, I'm working on myself, and I know what I want in life from a future partner. I want someone loving, adventurous, non-judgemental, loyal, committed, not a shrinking violet, someone who wants me for the potential she sees in us combined and not who/where I am right now in life. 

So why's it so hard?

Over the years, I've been described by people around me as good looking, smart, hardworking (you have no idea how hard i've worked over the years), wealthy, nice and thoughtful. I've always been the outdoorsy kind and recently became more sporty and fit. Yet despite all the stereotype things that you'll assume girls would like in a guy, I've been rejected countless of times by many girls. I've tried meeting girls online and offline and yes, we do go out on dates and stuff, and the dates seem to go well (lots of laughter and stuff) but I never really get them to fall for me. Months and weeks of effort can to go to waste as they tell me, ""you're not what I'm looking for"" and then things come to a stop. Apart of me feels frustrated for being that nice guy and sometimes I feel that me being ""nice"" is the reason why I'm unattractive to girls. Sometimes, I'm always thinking, those girls are single for a reason. I like to think it's because they're overly picky or are overly entitled. They complain about not being able to find a boyfriend, despite the fact that sometimes there are some really good ones right in front of them but they are too arrogant to see it. In their minds only those popular few guys are good enough for them, but man do they fail to look in the mirror to examine their own attributes, they ain't got much going for them. And then other times, I like to think that I am the problem, I'm not wild or exciting enough to attract their attention. Maybe there's something I am not doing right...

I don't ask a lot in a girl, just one who gets along with me well and cares for me as much as I care about her. Is it really that hard to find someone like that?

I can relate that.
Out of 8 billion people in the world, everyone has a different understanding and values in love. Love, mostly, starts with all the expression of affection, moves and scripts that learned from movies...
Sometimes, have u wondered, as two people get closer for a longer period of time, will u still enthusiastically do so?
Like you love your family, but you never say 'I love u' to them frequently or buy presents. Sometimes, love is simple, it doesn't need all the prescripted actions.
You just need to try to live in his/her life, truly understand what he/she needs, and being supportive.

ps: I do realise, sometimes, or for some man, women need to go in his life, be part of his life, let him can't live without u, and remain a sense of challenge and mystery for him.

1556,"I know people are going to judge me very harshly for this, but I guess I need some place to vent it.

I cheated on my ex with my current boyfriend. It was supposed to be a short term thing while I was still attached to my ex, since our sex life had dried up and to be honest, it was pretty unsatisfactory. To make matters worse, through the year or so we were together, we weren't meeting much, and for the entire relationship, you could count on two hands the number of proper dates that didn't end in an argument, and on one hand the number of times we had sex, so we weren't in a good place in the relationship.

Then I met my current bf during lectures. He was kinda cute and seemed to be a decent person, so one day I guess it got the better of us and we made out in an empty LT that we were studying in.

A few days later, I went over to his place to study together. One thing led to another, and we ended up having sex. I went home after, but I went over the week later and we did the deed again. It's not so much that I wanted intimacy, but really there was a serious lack of it. I was stressed and decided why not, since my relationship was clearly going nowhere.

I broke up with my boyfriend maybe a few months later, and decided to get together with my current bf. It might make me sound like a terrible person, but I don't regret leaving my ex for him. We have a good sex life, and he makes an effort to meet up, we're emotionally compatible and click very well. We've been together for about a year, and we're still making an effort with each other, and I can honestly say we both see this going further.

I guess people would judge us harshly if they knew how we started out, but I honestly don't think people around us need to know. Why am I posting this? I just needed the space to vent - I don't think they need to know, but I'm constantly worried that they'll judge my relationship exclusively on the basis of how it started.

Also for those not familiar, being a monk does not make one automatically have no more lust. Mental cultivation is needed. So it's the path to reduce and eventually get rid of lust. But as long as I am a lay person, there is no reason why I should remain celibate, other than pre monk training.

Thanks for those saying FWB, I don't think my conservative self allows that too. I can't even think about it. Also, not much female friends I know who is that liberal, and attracted to me as fwb. 

Emotionally however, I am currently falling for a very pretty girl, good thing we live far apart from each other. But my logical, rational mind doesn't allow me to initiate chasing her at all, even as a what if fantasy. I got over the hating self thing due to this internal conflict, but just wish to rant here as the training does not recommend suppression of feelings, nor acting on lust, craving. Just merely observe it is good enough. I am just afraid too that this Valentine's when I met her in a public talk, I might confess. I really shouldn't.

1577,"I am an aspiring monk, so expected to be celibate for life. I am virgin and evergreen. Yet the biological impulse and lust still sometimes tempt me to try to chase a girl. 

Here are some of my reasoning for not chasing a girl: 
To get into a relationship means to break up or marry, as I wish to become a monk to marry is out of the question, also, I see marriage as just more suffering. 

So only left break up, if she initiate, I have no problems, if I initiate, then I seem to have gotten together with a girl I claim to care and love only to break her heart. That's unfair to the girl. 

Only nice solution left is to have a relationship agreement like Sheldon in the big bang theory, the agreement is to have mutual agreed upon break ups, not to seriously fall in love with each other, but sex is not off the table.

So question here. Would this be considered as exploiting girls for sex? Would any girl at all likely agree to a relationship doomed to be broken up? Don't worry, if you are a girl and say you would agree, I most likely will not initiate contact as I am shy and also mostly sticking to not chasing girls as the dominant strategy. 

Also, I am concerned that I maybe the one who fall in love for real and I am super conservative, romantic and cannot bring myself to experience one night stand or visit prostitutes. 

Before any of you say: ""this means you're not meant for monkhood,"" or ""future monk behave and think like this,"" unless you had the same aspirations to become a celibate for life, you have no right to comment on what you had never experienced or know. 

Also to those who like to give psychological advices: no I do not hate myself for loving girls. Yes, I know how to reduce lust via meditation Yes, I am ok with dying a virgin, and evergreen. No, it's not possible for you to change my mind about being a monk.

She even took the initiative (through a mutual friend named Ricky) to go to his apartment to hang out. Fallon, being a nobody at that time, was nervous and never dared to imagine he’d have a chance to date Kidman. He stayed awkwardly quiet throughout that encounter and just played his Nintendo. In the end nothing happened. 

All the screenshots were taken during that interview clip (Totally unscripted moment) when Kidman revealed this. 

As V day is fast approaching, hopefully this will be a timely reminder to all the single dudes out there (not gonna elaborate what’s the reminder, I mean, if you don’t get this, just don’t get a girlfriend)

However in response to your post, the fact of the matter is that hindsight is 20/20. From a guy's point of view, I feel that hookup culture and the situation you described is applicable to both sexes. The fact of the matter is that it is becoming harder to enter committed relationships at this age compared to our parents' generation - that's why divorce rates are on the rise. It's not quite as simple as seek and you shall find in relationships these days. So for those struggling to find someone, what I would say is just focus on being the best version of yourself and bringing something to the table in a relationship, and naturally you will have a higher chance of attracting a best match. Relationships at these age are nice, but they are ultimately not some secret formula to happiness and in fact can be a huge ass emotional burden if things go south. Don't place your whole identity in finding him/her, but in finding you. Good luck.

1612,"To whoever wrote #57901

People like you who give such stupid advice in a bid to make single people feel better are just straight up naive at best or totally blase in privilege at worst. 

The question begged here is, do ""successful"" men (by whatever definition you want to use) finally get life partners because they truly want and love them, or only because of their added material and social value they finally possess? In other words, who they are isn't as important as what's in their wallet, who's on their contact list, or how successful they are in their careers? 

We have a description for such women/men who would go for people with riches and social status when they otherwise wouldn't if such sweeteners didn't exist. They're called gold diggers. 

Also, what the hell is with all the singlehood advice preaching that one should not make someone their mission or goal in life, and instead focus only on themselves and their own desires? There is nothing less valid about someone whose motivation is their partner/potential partner as compared to someone whose motivation is career success, fame or money. All it means is such people have different priorities in life. To such people like myself, family and love and people matter far more than chasing the corporate climb or becoming one of the Who's Who in society. As someone commented, you can be a millionaire and yet still feel like a loser if you're still single, or worse still at that point constantly paranoid that people want you potentially for all the wrong reasons when they wouldn't give you a second glance or a chance before. 

Family matters. Love matters. Having a life partner matters. Stop demonising single people and thinking that them changing their motivations in life is somehow going to make them feel better because you're just taking a crap all over what drives them and what they desire as though it is of less significance than your materialism and thirst for power/fame/social status. 

Just because single people might be used to being single, doesn't mean they necessarily should like it in order to feel better about themselves. I know I'm in no condition or state to be in a relationship now, but it doesn't stop me from wishing that I was.

1614,"I've moved on in the past few years or so I thought.
From living an empty life - a life where I went about day by day just taking each crashing wave one at a time; Where aimlessness is the only constant; to one where I was able to do well at what I did.

It took me a good amount of time to walk through the wreckage of a failed relationship and, for the most part, you were there, even when I was obviously a burden on you.

There was always one thing that pushed me along and brought a smile to me, particularly when I have had a crazy day. It was always when the chat notification popped up, an Instagram post of your day, or when I catch a glimpse of your smile as you walk past. 

I had never confided in anyone more than I had you. Maybe that was a mistake on my part. I opened up so much to you that I formed too much of an emotional attachment to you. While it can be said that there is some transference of what I imagine the ideal relationship should be, there was no denying that we worked well together, we had similar interests, similar sense of humour, similar thought patterns. We are so similar that you have become the part of me that I love talking to about anything. Maybe it is my perception of you, but you were the one that pointed out our similarities. That’s one thing I know that this is not fully a matter of transference and will make it hard for me to ever get over you.

I felt almost the same pulls on my heart when you told me of your engagement as I did when I first started to feel my own life was going nowhere. I thought that I was going to lose you. You, my anchor in the storm.
I was still happy for you, though it cuts me ever so slightly each time you speak of him, or to see the ring on your finger. Not that I would ever put myself forth as an option. I was a wreck and still not capable of any support you need.

I tried to go about my life without you, and I did get better. Even still, just talking to you puts a silly grin on my face. I still do have little fantasies of us getting together but even there it never lasts, because I know that I cannot be what you need. 

The day would come when you told me of the solemnisation. I knew it was coming before you had even typed those words on your keyboard. I still couldn't be prepared for it, though something about the way you said it made me wonder if that was what you wanted. I didn't dare ask more then because I felt that I might be living a fools' wishful dream that this was not what you wanted and that you wanted out. Despite my other friends saying that I shouldn't ask you about it, I knew I could not bear it if this wasn't something that you wanted - something that would make you happy. I feel of two minds when I see you. I am happy to know that you are happy, but yet I die a little inside knowing that I can't be that one that brings you that happiness. 

I am caught in between a rock and a hard place. Do I bypass the feelings that I have confessed to you and maintain the friendship we have, while I try to heal from the self-inflicted wounds from what would never be; or do I put more distance between us by leaving everything behind and starting afresh elsewhere. 

How I wish I could have been the right person for you. I would still try to be the right person in whatever capacity you need me to be. I take you as my inspiration to move on and free myself from my own shackles. I know it would be a harder road ahead as I know I cannot be reliant on you. What might have been if I had just met you sooner.
I did mean what I said before in that I cannot see myself in any relationship in the future. You have unknowingly set a high bar for anyone that would come along.

I can only wish you happiness and joy, and that if you call me, I will be there for you no matter what. I would never turn you down. You will forever be my friend.

1629,"This isn't going to be a 2 minutes entertainment, but a rather lengthy post which I hope to receive some advise from preferably girl's point of view as I am a guy, and may see this incident in a biased viewpoint. I have been attached to my lady for 4-5 years now, and she used to be seen as ""the one"". We were very happy together and we didn't quarrel throughout the years - till a few months back. It started with her being out with a small group of people, and trust me, I have never once limited or stopped her from going out. She is working, but because of this group, she started hanging out till, on average, 3am in the morning. The most ridiculous of all would be till 5am, despite having work the next day. This would happen in a week and the week following, until i voice my displeasure. She has also been very close to a guy which I think would make a good friend, until recently he decided to confess to her, despite being engage himself. Afterwards, we had some tiff and the conversation did subside a little, but a surfeit of chats followed there after. Despite she telling me that she had told the other party that they should limit their conversation, the chats didn't tone down a little. Verily, the chats nowadays might have revolve around work (I don't know) because I didn't want to read, hence I might be slightly overreacting a little. Now here is my question. Given all this, I didn't tell her to stop talking to him in the first place because I know there will need to work together. But I only wished that she would try to keep the conversation to the minimal because in my opinion, the guy stepped over the ""boundary of a friendship"" and how would things just be back to ""being normal"" once again. Is it on my part, that I am overreacting or being too sensitive? Because I do admit I am of a sensitive sort. What should I do because her being ""not the one"" has been crossing my mind. I hope you guys will put yourself in my shoes because it is always easy to say that ""since you have doubts, it meant that the trust is gone and bla bla bla"", but imagine for once, she was and might still be the one because there wasn't any issue prior.

We are taking the same module and yesterday was our first tutorial at the nus museum. When I entered the natural museum, I saw him and was instantly attracted to him. It wasn’t really love at first sight kind but it was hard to not notice him (though there was nobody except one lady who I reckon is the museum staff). He was wearing a white shirt, and I like guy in white shirt. He told me that we are at the wrong museum, so we started walking together towards the main museum.  We were chatting, however I was too excited & nervous that I stopped listening to what he said. I couldn’t take my eyes off him but I also tried not to have eye contacts, because when we locked eyes, he gave that killer smiles.

1634,"I have been happily attached for close to 4 years. During the first 2 years of the relationship, we did not have any sex because my girlfriend wanted to lose it to someone she thought she would marry. I have a high sex-drive and I was able to abstain sex and waited for her consensus. 2 years into the relationship we did it (it was both our first).

Here comes the problem. I have a high sex drive, but she doesn't. We only do it twice a month or even once a month. This few months has been intolerable for me. I feel like visiting FL just to do the deed (no strings attached of course).

I do not know why I am becoming intolerable of the lack of sex in our relationship. My girlfriend went for exchange in the last AY while I stayed in SG and I was totally fine with it. I even managed to fend off some advances some girls had on me (from hall and camps), and remained faithful to my girlfriend.

So the question now is, should I?

People say, you need to “move on” and show respect to your current partner........:.but why don’t people say “you shouldn’t contact your jc friends now that you’re alresdy with nus friends. Contacting jc friends prevents you from “moving on” and transitioning into nus univeristy life!!! “ has anyone said that?

 No. 

Why should we “move on” from previous relationships when a new one has formed? I will never forget my old friends in jc when I settle down in nus, and I don’t see how that’s being “unfair” to friends in nus? 

People also say “staying friends prolongs the pain of separation”. Separation happens in many ways, including graduation where I had to part with my closest friends from jc. 
How does cutting ties with my former friends from my previous school “prolong the pain of separation “? 

When school ends after graduation,I never cut off contact with my friends. I don’t believe staying friends with my jc mates prevents me from making more friends in nus and neither will this disrespect my new friends. 

So why can’t you stay friends once the relationship is over?

The reason is simple. The sex did not turn out as good as he expected. Could be because he’s a virgin with unrealistic expectations or you weren’t good in bed, etc. For #57574, both reasons could have applied to your context as you both were virgins.

There could be other reasons as well. I once met up with a foreigner through a dating app and we hooked up. The way she made out with me was kinda gross, and being a virgin she was inexperienced, so the encounter was really bad for me. She wanted to meet up again before she fly back but I ghosted her.

A girl friend of mine who did an exchange in Stockholm once told me that “people there are shy... they go for drinks and hook up... if the sex was great, they would date”. That sounded ridiculous to me back then as I was still a virgin but now I can totally relate.

My take is that it should simply be viewed as a basic instinct shared with other animals. I simply do not think sex should be glorified as something sacred to only occur after marriage. Just like we don't necessarily glorify all our meals. Perhaps it could be said that I am more or less alright with premarital sex, but more for the fact that it shouldn't be regarded as some sort of 'holy thing'.

1656,"Barely a week into the term, CS2040 and CS2040C have created quite a stir amongst students. 

Dijkstra reports.

Aikenot Dueet, a distraught 2040 student whom we found crying in a cubicle, told us how sorting has effectively screwed his life. ""At first, they sorted us by marks and assigned us letters based on a curve, and now, they are teaching us sorting while sorting us at the same time,"" weeped Aikenot.

We understand that students of this much dreaded course learn interestingly named sorting algorithms in the first few weeks, such as bubblesort, mergesort and quicksort. 

Despite being the humble algorithm it is, bubblesort embodies many of society's values. When a number is greater than the number on its immediate right, swapping happens. In layman terms, when one goes up, another has to go down. We'll discuss the socio-political significance of other algorithms in future reports.

Another student, Aino Laif, had a much more positive impression of 2040. He said, ""When finals ended, I felt as if my life no longer had any purpose. I was depressed by the lack of work and torture and even contemplated suicide. But thankfully, my depressing workless holiday was cut short by two weeks when my professor sent us an email asking us to do C++ problems or get sorted. That was the best new year of my life.""

Students of the school of Java have it much worse than their C++ counterparts as they are constantly reminded of the fact that their lives are public, static and void. Disciples of Source and survivors of 1101S were mortified to find mutation in almost every line of code they wrote. The uninformed had a nasty shock when they realised Java and JavaScript were two very different things.

A resigned student, Aikenever Dueet, told us, ""I joined CS with the hope of changing the world. Now, I guess I'll just be flipping pancakes for the rest of my living days.""

The aforementioned student wasn't enthused when we pointed out a sorting algorithm named after his potential career.

Meanwhile, our investigative journalists are busy finding connections, if any, between the 2040 instructors, the head of the state and the fountain of wealth. We hope to get back to you soon.

1657,"I have been knowing her for 9+ years since secondary school. I like her since then. After finishing A-level, we started to meet up more frequently and then date. She didn't like me before we date, but she said that she started to realise she loves someone mature like me. We had significant progress, kissing and then ... (well, technically we are still virgin). However, I started confused the relationship between us and the 'love' between us. I knew that I would love to cuddle, kiss, have sex with her under the impulse of biological interaction. However, if we don't do those, I wasn't too sure if there is still 'love' between us, in a way that we would always say we miss each other, talk for a few hours everyday... (in fact I am not those people who like to intentionally say 'I miss you' or do whatever because we are in a relationship, like I rarely say it to my parent but I do love them very much). I found that I don't like relationship becomes something to be prepared, organised, analysed and then acting 'strategically'. It should be simple, and shouldn't be like in a business, I guess. Thus, I proposed her that we kept separated for a while, and probably we will figure it out, with time. She was sad, and she said I am the only one she loves, regardless of her 5-6 relationships before me (not too sure if it's because I was the only one she ever slept with, and the same for me)(for the record, I only date once and thus she was my only gf, no reference for me to compare and figure what was between us). However, I thought I really need some time to figure things out, thus I have to tell her we need time. I know I am a bad guy, but I would rather do so to avoid hurting her further if there was no love between us, but just some remnant of biological impulse. 
After that, we tried to keep a distance from each other, not meeting and talking for 1-2 years. Then, we started contacting and chatting once every few months. We behaved cool and pretended like friends. Both of us try very hard not to do anything that induces the relationship. So, she treats me like a girl and a friend. One night (recently), we had dinner together and then I accompany her back. She suddenly hugged me. There was silence. I pretended cool and reply phone call (i.e. do something else) to avoid further development. After the call was finished, she said she miss me, after all those years, she tried but she said she always find comfort in me, and she will never feel the same to someone else. (not too sure if it's because I was the only one she ever slept with, and the same for me) We are single since we broke up. She never dates someone else because she said she don't find the same feelings. I never, not too sure of the reason, but partly because I still don't understand what love is after watching all the romance drama, and I don't have the same feeling on someone else as well. She kissed me and I found myself can't reject it. She said our relationship is complicated, going back-and-front between friends and partner, and she doesn't mind we stay together as partners until one of us find someone else. 
Well, I do understand, saying that we could be friends, is the biggest lie. 
I don't know what next, and that night we slept together out of unstoppable impulse. Again, I don't know if our attachment to each other is out of biological interaction, or something else.

I mean, I can only get very comfortable with close friends (I don't consider her a close friend yet) but still we had quite a good time and we really enjoyed each other's company. Well the thing is after the date, shit happened. Up till now I have 0 experience in the dating game and I automatically assumed that she was interested in a relationship with me just because she has agreed to go out with me + some other hints which I won't really write here because she may be a regular visitor of this page. Meanwhile she's a really busy girl and takes really long to reply to my texts. I mean at the start I was okay about it but then I realised she was starting to take way too long to reply. She tells me that she's really busy so she doesn't text much yet when we were hanging out she was glued to her phone. I mean it isn't that difficult to just reply a person every few hours right, even if you're not very interested in the person yet? Well I guess that's when I screwed up because I then became passive aggressive to her. Eventually, she told me that she doesn't feel like we can be anything more than friends. Is there any way I can salvage this man? I'm having unnecessary doubts because I feel like she probably thinks I'm trying to chase her just for a casual relationship since I seem like I'm rushing her to date me. This is also mainly due to the fact that I had a bad reputation in my previous school which should be because I kind of look like a punk/ fkboi (I mean a lot of people tell me that) and I guess I acted like one back then because I wanted to seem cool in front of others (I'm over that shit). Plus, its probably because of the way that I was quite an immature asshole to her just because she takes too long to reply. I guess I was just feeling really bad that this whole thing was kind of one sided but then I realised she may just have wanted to be friends with me before thinking about starting a relationship. I mean we didn't even know each other beforehand? Thing is I really do have feelings for her and I just don't know what to do from here lol. I'm not even angry at her for rejecting me, I'm just disappointed with myself for losing such a great girl.

I found out that my boyfriend (of close to a year) has been using Tinder for the last 2 months — using a fake name, but real profile pic.

He added that it is also kind of an ego booster when he gets matches, liken to shots of adrenaline? I read through the conversations (very few active chats) and the tone seems neutral and boring in fact.

Eventually, instead of keep clarifying what love is, I decided to act just based on my surface consciousness and impulse. I confess to someone that I love him/her without further analysing whether I actually love him/her or understand what love is.
Unfortunately, things didn't come out as I expected. The worst case scenario happens: It wasn't he/she rejected me; I didn't even get the chance to tell him/her that I love him/her before he/she indirectly shut me up.
Sometimes, I am wondering if all of this is arranged, that he/she isn't meant to be the right one? What does the right one mean?

1693,"Admin please don't delete this. I have been tgt with my gf for about 3 years now. As with all couples, it started great but I guess as time went by we slowly lost the spark, especially as work kicks in. I love her a lot and I still do. I have been loyal in this relationship and I thought of marrying her one day. I tried my best to do what I think a bf should do - try to spend time with her whenever I can and bring her to try different food whenever I am free. I pay for the meals all the time and I really don't see an issue with that. I guess I am still traditional and my idea of a good bf/husband is someone who works hard and provides for his loved one. We do have quarrels sometimes but my friends told me that it's normal as all couples do. To me, it's a relationship I treasure as we went through quite some challenges such as exchange. Hence, it's reached a point where I am thinking of asking her to marry me. However, there are some issues that bother me. For one, we never have had sex in our past 3 years. My gf insists on only having sex when we get married. Before you start judging me, I admit that I am curious about it as I have not have done it before and I believe this is normal for a guy. Also, I have some concerns about sexual compatibility as many of my friends told me that the thought of getting married without having sex beforehand in today's era is quite unthinkable. However, I respect my gf's choice and I never brought it up to her in the past 3 years (she told me she doesn't want to do it till marriage before we got together). I always thought that a relationship should not have anyone imposing a one-sided will on the other party. Hence, I am willing to go along with it. However, I guess what's making me puzzled recently is that she became resistant to me holding her hands in the recent months. I can't even recall the last time we kissed each other - probably 4-5 months ago, and she is against me holding her hands when we are together in the recent 3-4 months as well. She wasn't against it when we first got together and hence it is just puzzling to me now. I asked her about it but she doesn't quite say it. She just pushes my hand away when I try to hold her hand when we are dating outside. Looking at my other friends in loving relationships, these issues feel like red flags that linger in my mind and just make me wonder if I should take mine further. This is also when she stopped asking me to visit her family as she used to ask me to join her family gatherings. The issue has been bothering me quite a bit recently. I thought I did everything a good bf could think about but I just couldn't seem to be able to make it right. Hence, I am wondering if any of you have some advice on how to decipher the situation. Please feel free to criticize me if you feel it is my fault as well. I am open to all advice.

1710,"I talk to my current BF about my sexual history (generally just going over the basics that I think he should know) and he totally flips his shit even though he's asked about them. I don't have many previous relationships but he's completely focused on the regularity of sex and other more specific details. I made the mistake of telling him (after he asked) that my ex and I had a very active sex life, about once a week, and he completely flipped out, demanding to know when and where and all sorts of things, asking me how good it was and all that.

I'm not sure how to respond to this, on one hand he's asking, and will likely think I'm hiding something if I don't answer, but on the other hand clearly he's not taking this very well?

He seems fine about my previous exes since the sexual activity wasn't that much, maybe about once a month, but completely flips out over this most recent one though it's been about a couple of years back and I honestly cannot remember much.

For context, he's asking about details like number of orgasms, positions and places, and like number of times we had unprotected sex... and I think he even asked about total number of times we had sex? I mean it's about once a week, you did ask, why you flipping out? And like do you really expect me to remember this? Number of times we had unprotected sex well I understand perhaps it's a concern, but I did get tested and I do insist on protection with him, so I don't see the issue; is he just jealous I insist on protection with him?

And it's not like he's a virgin incel or whatever, we do have sex too, just probably not as often since he's not exactly skilled at it. If anything I should be the one who's concerned, since he's been slightly dodgy on his relationship past.

1712,"Maybe let me offer a different view on sexual exclusivity? Graduated from NUS, married with kids and now doing okay in the financial industry to be given a corner office in the financial district.

You people may be too hung up about sexual exclusivity in a relationship. Yes it is good to monogamous after marriage, but have seen way too many examples to know that sexual exclusivity is not a necessity for a happy marriage, or relationship. For all the romantics, affairs are way more common than you think. Try throwing a rock in the mbfc area and you are more likely than not to hit someone who slept with someone outside a relationship. The anxiety and anguish over loss of sexual exclusivity is what causes people to hide affairs in the first place.

I used to be a romantic for monogamy too, until my husband confessed that he was sleeping with a colleague. At first I felt angry and divorce was on my mind. Then after a night of cool down, I was not going to dismantle my family because he stuck his dick in another female's hole. He was and is still a loving husband and father. 

For the sake of the kids, I told him no divorce if I could have my own fwbs too. Funny how when the tables are turned, males start reconsidering their actions. He agreed though, and the kids were none the wiser. In my industry, well-dressed, good-looking people working long hours together are conducive grounds for finding fwbs, and it was not difficult for me to find my own (two is all I can handle).

Of course, there are ground rules, like protection to be worn at all times, to let each other know before liaisons with the fwbs, no getting pregnant or impregnating an fwb, and that family time is of paramount priority. I also go for and get my fwbs to go for regular health screenings. You are wrong if you think the sex is very frequent because we all lead busy lives. It's more like a catch up lunch, then followed by some private time together.

Some will judge me for this, and I don't care. My value as a female, mother and employee does not decrease because of the number of dicks I explored. Similarly, my husband's value as a male and father does not increase because of the number of females he stuck his dick into. Perversely, maybe due to the male ego, my husband insists on a session with me after he knows I had a liaison with one of my fwbs. Letting go of our insistence on sexual exclusivity has returned the much-needed spark to our relationship which has honestly gone stale before this.

For the girl who slept with her colleague, you should be honest with your boyfriend. If he cannot accept sexual non-exclusivity while you crave it, then you guys are not suited for each other. Find someone who can accept this craving of yours and you will be much happier.

This ability to let go of insisting on sexual exclusivity is not for everyone, and many will have a hard time accepting it. But this is an option for those who are unsure of a way forward.

1713,"Because no one will day this: both sexes do want casual sex, it is our biological imperative. But understanding the concept of Sexual marketplace value (SMV) helps ellucidates this often undiscussed and vaguely understood area of the sexual dynamics. 

Women peak in the early twenties, while men peak in their early thirties. Everyone by choice will choose a partner with the highest SMV, and SMV decreases exponentially for women with and increase in partners, whether you like it or not, in the eys of most men (skip me with the anecdotal evidence fallacy will ya). That is why theres the colloquial joke about roasties hitting the WALL at the big 3-0.  

Why are 'promiscuous' men less of a social taboo bemoans the modern woman. Because despite whatever modern society wants you to believe, the literature from evolutionary psychology explains why: we are still wired in a way that men primarily seek a childbearer and women seek a resource provider (thats why women are hypergamous). Because it is evolutionary inefficient to be raising another man's child (step-fathers overwhelmingly over represent child abuse cases), and there was no contraception in the past, prioritize women who has had the fewest partners, becuase the child is more likely to be HIS. (calling this arguement sexist or whatever is not an argument. Saying that its the current year, its 2018! Is also not an argument. I am arguing that this is what men and women want primarily, and supported empirically, and NOT what is right and wrong.)

This is why in sexually conservative countries the age gap between couples tend to be smaller. While more sexually liberated countries have larger age gap between couples to match the pairings SMV. The 30yo man with a career isn't going to settle for the roastie in her thirties, he will aim for chick in her twenties. In more 'conservative' countries: women with less partners > higher SMV> lower age gap.  Prime example: look at the the mean couple age difference in america and compare the boomers and millenials. 

Once again, I am merely laying out an argument for the observed phenomena of our sexual dynamics, and not making any moral arguments, although if you understand this you realise how rapidly everything falls into place about society, its norms, the difference in standards and our understanding about why pre-sexual liberation morality was as it is, not because it it was right or wrong but because it facilitated developing a stable society. (One theory was that violence rapidly increases when males are sexually fustrated, the basis for monogomy and the marriage instituition which limited partners. 

For what its worth I'm a guy who says this with some remorse who has had multiple partners and now in my early 20s. I am pro liberty: do whatever you want, but don't deny the costs. Its there whether you like it or not.

1718,"Chiming in on the whole thing about fwb/sex before marriage. 

Personally i'm someone who's had sex with a handful of girls (all my exes). The sex was great and all, but I have to agree with #55982 that a lot of the gratification is short-lived. Even right after the sex, there's the usual post-coital tristesse. The 'reward' is mostly confined to before and during intercourse. 

Having tasted the joys (if you will) of sex and also now the fulfillment of being in an abstinent long-term relationship, I actually regret not staying a virgin till after marriage. I've never encountered anyone who deems lack of sexual experience as a dealbreaker. At worst, it's seen as an inconvenience to the more experienced partner. On the other hand, I can totally see why a person who's a virgin will feel bothered by someone who's had sexual history. My current girlfriend of 3 years is rather conservative and although she's kinky in private, often times going off on that tangent, she's clear about wanting to remain a virgin till after marriage. She initially thought I was a virgin as well. I wanted to be totally honest with her so I spilled the beans as soon as I mustered the courage. Knowing that we both liked each other already by then, it pained me to watch her deal with the shock of that information. She accepted me in the end, but I know she's still slightly bothered by it. It simply would've been better if I were a virgin as well.

Based off me and my peers' experience, i'd say that having a sexual history reduces one's eligible dating pool (with virgins). I also find that girls who are more 'traditional', 'backward', '1800s' w/e have more desirable qualities that guys would seek in someone they intend to marry and settle down with. Most likely the reverse is true as well--with voluntary virgins, that is; not too sure about bitter incels lol. 

Power to those who want to bang everything that moves; it's a personal choice after all. But if the intention is to one day settle down in a long-term monogamous relationship with a view to marriage and kids, then I think the odds of finding and retaining a suitable partner for that goal would be higher if one refrains from pre-marital sex. In the meantime, just grab your dick and double click.

1720,"Tbh i am glad a post like #55982 showed up because those recent posts diminished further hopes of finding people with the same values as me with regards to intercourse. Believe me when I say I come from a place of love. I do have friends who done it before marriage and have not judged them. we just have different principles and that is completely fine because you alone determine what sex means to you. Simply for pleasure? Holds not much significance? That's cool. 

To me though, I believe in saving myself for the person who is going to stay with me till my very last breath (unless that person goes first hoho) because sex to me solely means ""making love"" (it can have various meanings for different people la) and I think it's a beautiful intimate act that should be exclusive to the one person you are definitely going to spend the rest of your life with. Not just that, sex is scientifically like a lock. It bonds you emotionally to the person (I read somewhere that a guy's DNA will forever be in your body when you have intercourse. Not sure if it's true but I would only want to have one person's DNA inside me and that one person best be my spouse. How neat is it to have only his/her DNA on you when you are without him/her? He/she is literally always with you and going to be a part of you.) 

Again, i am not here to criticise those whose principles/beliefs are different from mine, but I want to assure a small/big group of people who are saving themselves for marriage that you can still find someone with the same belief. Chances might be slim but it is still possible. However, I would not encourage you to limit your dating circle to virgins only because what ultimately matters is the person. Does his/her values towards sex/love/other factors (almost) align with yours? Does he/she do it for love or pleasure (not mutually exclusive btw)? Then that is good enough. I have grown to embrace the possibility that my future spouse would not be a virgin. Even though it seems like everyone is doing it, don't let society pressure you into doing something against your own beliefs. And even if my future spouse did not save himself/herself for me, at least you saved yourself for him/her! It may seem like a very traditional value, but this is just what sex and love means to me: saving yourself for that one person who will be the one who would walk through with you throughout life's smallest and greatest moments. It makes the activity even more special because it is something solely shared between the two of you. 

Food for thought: There's this argument on how you need to ""train""??? JUST PRACTICE TOGETHER AFTER MARRIAGE LAH. 
To those who feel offended by this, please dont. We just have different beliefs and that is completely fine! You will/have found your group of people and I hope I'll be lucky enough to find mine.

1721,"Unsure where #55950 gets his confidence that #55930 is his girlfriend. On the other hand, I think #55930 is probably my girlfriend, especially after the events over the weekend.

We got attached quite recently. I also know that I am her third boyfriend. As new lovebirds in the honeymoon phase, we went for a two night staycation. Nothing out of the ordinary happened other than our first sex together (I wore protection). On the second night, things took a bizarre turn. She wanted to do the deed unprotected, but she said she needed to make a confession. A confession that she slept with a married colleague for about a year in the time between her last relationship and knowing me.

I felt crushed. And my libido went down faster than the sterling pound would on a no-deal Brexit.

She then confessed through tears that she started sleeping with him because they worked long hours together and the first night happened after some copious amounts of alcohol and persistent persuasion by him. After the first night, she continued sleeping with him because she felt an emotional connection to him, and that she felt lonely having exited a rather long relationship. She felt I should know that they had unprotected sex multiple times, even though both of them were clean as their workplace required regular HIV and blood screenings. She also further confessed that that was not her first time sleeping outside a relationship as she slept with one of her exes when they were not yet together.

I felt utterly crushed.

There was the newly found love of my life confessing her past deeds which I would have otherwise felt repulsive. Even though I am not a virgin myself, my past and only partner was my previous official girlfriend. I told her I needed some time to think and we turned in for the night on different sides of the bed.

I stayed awake, and she did too. It fell into place. She constantly mentioning her need for emotional connection when I first dated her. Her rather excellent bed skills that seem incongruent with her long spell of singlehood after her last relationship. She is frankly not the best looking girl around, but I can sort of understand why the married colleague continued returning to sleep with her, for she must have satisfied him where his partner didn't.

I still felt crushed, but the rational part of me knows that it was my ego (the number of past sexual partners) that felt crushed. 

What she did before knowing me is part of her history, and as a single at that time, she was not accountable to me. She said she stopped sleeping with him when she felt cheap and that she needed to enter into a more fulfilling relationship with someone who would spend his life together with her. She has since moved to a new workplace, and her health screenings since then have shown nothing wrong.

I felt crushed, but less crushed.

By taking a leap of faith to be fully candid with me, she hoped to put this behind her and move on properly without it being a guillotine over our relationship. As it is in the past before she knew me, the least I could do is to accept her for what she is now, and build our lives together as a new couple.

I reached out to her. She was still sobbing. I told I appreciated her honesty and want her to put all these behind her. Her sole emotional connection should be with me only, and vice versa. We made sweet love, before I cheekily asked her to serve me with her full repertoire of bed skills.

I felt crushed, but this time, it was feeling crushed by her libido. I regretted my cheeky request.

By the time the sun rose, she was snoozing away under the sheets in bliss. I stayed awake. This is merely the start of our journey. I may not like her history, but it is part of her that I will have to accept. What is more important is that we move forward together. To put it crudely, how many cave explorers she had, or whether I am the first cave explorer, is way less important than the fact that we are each other's last and only explorer from now on.

Honeybee, you may not know that I read NUSWhispers since I am not from NUS, but if #55930 is truly you, the above words are my true feelings.

Your nectar.

PS if #55930 is not my honeybee, oops. But honesty is still the best policy.

1729,"#55865 Hi, sorry, to be honest, your friend should ask herself if she's content with this guy. I don't see an issue with having multiple previous partners, especially since he's at least decent enough to not talk (read: brag) about them, and to be fair, your friend didn't ask.

I've seen people who can't shut up about their previous partners, whether they talk about bedroom antics or just generally stories about their exes to their current bf/gf, and I think that's just massively disrespectful unless they've clearly stated that they want to know. Disclaimer here, I've seen someone who's used the fact that a project acronym was the same 3 letters as the start of her ex bf's name to launch into a long rant about her ex, and I think that's completely unreasonable and totally selfish.

I think it's important for people generally to adopt a don't ask don't tell kind of situation, unless you're sure you can handle it, and unless there's really something important to raise like an STI or a previous pregnancy I guess. In this case clearly your friend can't handle it, and I'd advise her to go talk to him about it calmly, because there's no sense in ruining something that's good now over something that's fucked up in the past.

I guess I can see why she'd be concerned, probably thinking along the lines that she's not ""unique"" or that there's nothing ""special"" about this relationship to him rather than all the others, but I think at the end of the day, special is what you make it. The difference is simply that the rest are in the past, and one day they'll be forgotten. If he's serious about this one, why not?

Anyway, this is for them to decide. I can only advise them to talk about it, and honestly, if she's otherwise happy and this is something she thinks she can get over in the long run, why ruin it now?

I mean, good guys and good sex are hard to find, girl. Don't ruin it on a whim, and don't end it without talking about it first.

1730,"To #55865: Guys usually overstate their number of previous sexual partners... just saying. But on the off chance that it's accurate - I mean you can tell in bed, honestly. Personally my ex and I broke up on personal differences, so I can't say I empathise much. But he's had a few previous partners as well... I'm pretty sure more than 8, and he was exceptionally good, which makes it all the more awkward when I bump into him at techno. Well here's to more years of bumping into him at E2 café...

But from a more serious perspective, I think maybe people should carefully weigh the pros and cons about breakup before actually considering it. Finding someone who gets you is not easy, and oftentimes even if they say there are plenty more fish in the sea, even when you catch another fish, you end up comparing it to the one that got away. And the one that got away will always be bigger because you're looking at it through rose tinted glasses.

So the saying should be there are plenty more fish in the sea, so don't stop till you catch a sea king. (Yes, I read One-Piece, don't judge, it's not only a guy thing). If your friend thinks that she's found the one, then this small issue isn't going to bother her that much. Maybe it's something else that's bothering her, and this sudden revelation has just made it worse.

Well all the best I guess, these things are always rather thorny to deal with. But mind you, getting dumped hurts like a bitch, so be careful about bringing it up.

1731,"Regarding the debacle over the sexual history of romantic partners here, I would like to point out that this may be the result of a hyper–sanitized and purist mindset over sex that had been encouraged and perhaps indoctrinated in us at youth. I do not blame my parents, as every parent would want to protect their child and their innocence. However, as an Asian that grew up in Europe, I have got to experience on one end, a more liberal, sex-positive society and on another end a more Asian, conservative one dominated by Abrahamic faiths (here).

What I would like to suggest is that by oversanitizing the topic of sex, giving it too strong a cringe-factor and associating it with disgust, virginity suddenly becomes an excessively important factor for relationships. This seems to be part of mainstream culture here and I accept that.

Whilst I applaud the pragmatism of our society, I believe that perhaps this puritanical ideation of love, sex and marriage could be a contributing factor to the declining birth rate. By over–sanitising sex in our culture, this prohibits an honest and reasonable intergenerational dialogue (for instance between parent and child, teacher and student) and also halts any form of sexual deviance and exploration. In so doing, we have successfully steered ourselves away from a society that can achieve reproductive success (healthy TFR).

What I suggest is that key stakeholders continue to expand the image of open–arms, open–ears positivity to the sex education system, not just the current areas already covered by the public health agenda (I see promise in the cheesy adverts on diabetes), as I believe this would benefit the youth of today and tomorrow.

It's bugging me even more since she's very cautious and insists on protection with me.

I don't usually ask about sexual history, but it came up during a checkup and I don't know how to deal with it.

1745,"Hi #55301, OP of #55237 here, just to clarify some things - she's been fangirling over him ever since they met in one of their course mods, and basically gushing about it. I'm not saying that it means anything, but she's been emotionally distant since she met him, and it seems that even though they just met they're abnormally close. I'm not sure about how you see it, but for me it's slightly alarming that they go home together almost every day, and I'm pretty sure that their timetabling can't be so ""zhun"" that they're in the same class for literally everything? Either he shifted his classes around to meet her, or the other way around.

Maybe it's paranoia or just me. But I can't shake the feeling that people don't get so close to each other that fast in under a semester without something going on behind the scenes. I've mentioned that she's been emotionally distant, and that we haven't seen each other much of late since we've been rather busy. But despite the emotionally distant part - she seems to be rather overeager? Like she's emotionally distant, but on occasion it seems like she's trying to make up for something and seems extra nice and stuff. I know that sounds weird, but to put it more clearly, she seems nicer and happier, but less emotionally involved with me? It just seems like she was trying to hide something.

I thought at the time that it could have been just my paranoia too, but the speed at which she got with the other guy was alarming - it was barely a month after we broke up, and I wouldn't say our relationship was on the rocks. I heard she went home with him barely a week after we broke up, and she wasn't the type to jump into bed with just about anyone - for us it took months, so I'm quite sure of some things, I just don't have any evidence. Yeah, I know I'm insecure, but I made it a point not to badger her about her male friends, I only asked cause he kept coming up in conversation.

I've been trying to find evidence of it for some time now, but I can't seem to find anything. I've been stonewalled by her friends and sometimes even by mutual friends, and she doesn't seem to accept follower requests anymore - her social media seems to have gone dead.

I know it's still conjuncture on my part, and I know all of this might just literally be me overthinking, but it's not a good place right now. All of this is hindsight, and I'm not sure of what I'm seeing, so maybe I may have been too accusatory. I'm just confused right now. TBH, all my friends tell me I'm overthinking this, but my head's not listening.

I know it's time to move on, and that maybe I'll never get closure from her, but it's hard I guess...

Anyway finals have ended for me, so it's just me, my thoughts and I again...

Though we knew each other since secondary school, having been in the same elective programme and meeting at a joint school workshop, we didn't get together till much later since he was in a long term relationship at the time. After jc we went out and decided to make it official, and when he enlisted we stopped meeting so often. There wasnt much time since he was in camp a lot because of his appointment and because it was somewhere ulu near changi Airport, he'd showed me on the map before but I forgot, it's been 2+ years so well... But anyway that was kind of why we didn't meet up much. It took a long time to get back to civilisation.

All through it he was sometimes really tired, but he'd still make it to our dates and stuff, and head over to my place afterwards. I found out later after we broke up over something else that he'd been seeing some other girl from his JC behind my back, and I'd actually met her before, but he told me she was just a good friend.

I don't think you sleep with your good friends.

Oh well, saw him in school a few days ago with another girl again. Wonder what happened to his other girls, but nah not really.

Should have been slightly warned by the fact that he was in his first relationship in sec school despite being in a boys school... And then after JC I was his 3rd ""official"" but I suspect like 7th ""unofficial"" ? Like wow man, that's quite the turnover rate.

Don't know if this is considered cheating because she did break up with me first before starting this new one but it sure as hell feels like it.

1764,"hi! it's me again from #55180 <--- this confession! Thank you to those who left thoughtful suggestions. The thing is, I can't talk to his parents because we do not have a common language at all. I have discussed this with my bf before, and our career goals and parenting philosophies align. He wants to make something out of himself, and not just rely on his parents' money, and I intend to pursue my higher education and career as well. He motivates me to want to work harder/smarter, be a better daughter, and a stronger leader. I also really like how we match up in terms of academic performance, ambition and drive, yet still manage to make time for each other. I know some people may say ""just elope"", but I cannot neglect my duties as a daughter, and I will never allow him to hurt his parents like that. It's really sad, that a relationship has to end because of circumstances, and not because of the fault of one of the parties. I may be young (and stupid), but I think I've found The One, and it hurts to have to let him go eventually.

I really see a future with him, and so does he. He ticks all of my boxes, and he says that I am everything he wants in a wife. However, our parents (both sides) disapprove of the relationship, with reasons such as different nationalities and language barriers, and his parents think that my family background is not good enough for their family. I understand that a relationship is ultimately between two people, but in a marriage, two families, not just two individuals come together. His mom really dislikes me (my race, my appearance, my average family background). What should I do? We are still going out with the mindset that this will not last, but we are enjoying each other's company too much to let go. It really pains me to know that he will have someone else (someone better) to refer to as his wife and look at her the same way he looks at me now. He is my first boyfriend if thats relevant!!

1767,"I have a Friend (I’ll be referring to him as G) who’s in love with this girl and it’s a complicated relationship to say the least. The gist of how it started was that the girl confessed to G bout how she likes him,G started to talk to her, allegedly both fell in love with each other but due to circumstances, could not (and still cannot) be together. They text regularly but from what I’ve heard he hasn’t seen her in a very long time. 

G is very passionate and has a tendency to put people first, in the ways that he thinks matters, like buying them meals often. So In the case of this girl, he is so smitten with that he straight out splurges on her. Just yesterday, he bought a charm that cost him a chunk of his salary (he’s an intern - you can imagine his allowance). He’s done this several times for her.

What I don’t understand is that he tells me that she doesn’t act like she cares. Like she only thinks of herself. Doesn’t ask about him at all when they text and he tells me that hurts him, because he’s not sure of her feelings towards him and whether it’s the same as it was before. He tells me he wants to get out of this - whatever this relationship is - but at the same time he tells me he loves her and because he’s so empathetic and passionate he’s afraid she will “break” if he ends this. And he wants to always put her first. He has also told me his logical side is telling him not to continue but his emotional side is telling him to keep in touch with her. I tell him to actually tell her that he’s unhappy - at least she might be more aware but he doesn’t want to because he says he’d rather see her being “happy and oblivious” than to try. 

Can anyone help me understand this? 

J, if you’re seeing this, and I know you browse this site regularly, I don’t know if you’re just plain oblivious to this or looking for him only when you need him for your own benefit, but just know that just because you’re “not obligated to do anything” doesn’t mean you can take advantage of him and use him as your emotional footstool.

1772,"Dear you,

After seeing one of the posts on this website, I couldn't help but wonder if it was me you were talking about; because of that, the thought of you has been filling up my mind most of the time these past two days.

You have a girlfriend and even if I'm not attached, I currently am seeing a special someone. Albeit, our interest towards each other still grew as time passed (I pressume) I honestly do not know why because clearly, we aren't close. We're even more like acquaintances than friends but trust me, it would have been a huge pleasure to get to know you even better. If only time permits right? If only we still have the chance to; and if only we took those chances that we had in the past weeks to get to know each other but we didn't. 

You are leaving (and that sucks). When you return, I highly doubt we will see each other in person again. There are still chances but I guess it will be quite slim. I guess we just got lucky this semester. 

I really just want to tell you that even if it was such a brief moment, you were probably the only one who showed such concern and thought towards me in the span of a semester, upon taking into account that we just met. Hence, I did form a really good first impression of you. I did question your true intentions though. Well, If my assumptions were true then I do hope you can make the effort to communicate and reach out to me (I'm sure you know how) I'm not so sure why you didn't do so earlier on, your reason for this (as seen from your post on this website) was actually very trivial which made me question its validity. 

You were right, fated to meet but not meant to be together. Sadly.

This is the very last time you will hear or see me say something about this so-called issue. If you do feel something, please tell me. Please.
If you don't want to, please atleast reply to this post. I really want to know if you feel something similar. I will be waiting.

I hope this way, we'll have a better peace of mind and then probably figure out how to also have peace with our hearts.

Regards,
That girl

My ex-boyfriend broke up with me and that really crushed all my confidence.
I really love him a lot and I believe I have done my best to show my love and concern for him throughout the whole relationship. 
I made effort to know each of his close friends and his family members and when I went overseas, I would also bring back gifts for them.
I don't play games but I would drop all my work just to watch him play his games to show my support.
When we go out, I always initiate to pay for my share and sometimes, I would pay for him as well. 
Throughout our whole relationship, I have never once been angry at him.
Whenever he argued with me, I would apologize first even though sometimes it was not my fault.
and no matter how much he hurt me and made me cry, I would always forgive him and smile at him the next time I see him.
I was really supportive of what he does as well, be it his studies or his work.
When he needed to stay up late to do his work, I would stay awake to accompany him.
or when he needed to wake up early, knowing that he's someone that had trouble waking up, I would wake up early with him and keep him accompany until he reached his destination
even though the night before I slept late.
I really did my best and did everything I could for him.
He was really sweet to me as well, always telling me that he was lucky to have me around because nobody has ever loved him like I did.
Yet...
He still broke up with me in the end. 

Looking at every other happy couple, especially those in long-term relationship, I really envy them.
Is it something really wrong with me that both my relationships didn't work out? 
2 broken relationships really made me wonder if I deserve to love or to be loved at all.
I really did my best in both...

Now, the thought of falling in love with someone new scares me. I'm afraid that I would hurt the next important person in my life...

Sorry for being overly pushy and assertive, especially what I said after you left the library, I know it made you feel very uncomfortable, and honestly im not sure why I even said that. You said to give us time, yet I was an idiot to repeatedly say those stuff. 

Sorry for posting our pics on Instagram even though you are clearly not comfortable with it. I should have respected your boundaries and comfort levels on so so many occasions.

I believe your friendship endures beyond physical intimacy and that this relationship was not built on sexual desires. You value it beyond the sexual satisfaction it has given to you. Take the first step of talking about the incident with your friend and ask him how he feels. Assure him that you value the friendship and through the vulnerabilities shared, the friendship will be strengthened on the basis of understanding and empathy.

It first started with just harmless pushing around but somehow we ended up embracing each other and started making out. We then almost went third base but stopped after realising how weird AF it was. After that we just slept and the next day we went about doing our own things. After this incident, things got really weird and we got really distant. It has been a few months and we have grown so distant we barely even say Hi anymore. Even at social events where we both are present, we just avoid each other as much as we can.

This incident has made me have so many sleepless nights and I started to have affection for other guys as well. Idk maybe I was always gay but never realised it. Maybe that's why my relationships with girls never worked out. The sex was okay but nothing to rave about for me. I tried going on a gay app to meet other people cos I wanted to re-live the experience I had with said friend, but chickened out within a day as there were so many dodgy characters on the app, and there was also the fear of being found out. Truth be told I really miss that friend, and I am not even sure if it's as a friend, or because I now have feelings for him.

I don't mean in the context of online conversations since these taper out quite naturally but if people have met up or gone on a physical date at least once, why would anyone think that ghosting if they're not interested is a great idea? 

Isn't it basic courtesy to drop a simple text along the lines of: ""Hey, it was nice meeting/hanging out with you but I don't think we would work out romantically. Wishing you all the best!""?

I've never been in a situation to be ghosted before but I've heard of it happening to friends, girls and guys alike, and this phenomenon just seems so puzzling to me.

Our friends are typically quite OK with our relationship too, even though we're about 2 decades in age difference.

Recently I realised that I might not really be in love with him anymore. It's super hard to explain, especially since I remember clearly that when we first started dating, I was really into him, and I foresaw a life ahead together with him. I've a feeling it's partly because I've been really busy with school and sometimes it's just hard to put him as a priority. It's sometimes vice versa though – he'd be busy with work and we'd have to put our plans on hold etc. Mostly, I feel like the spark between us is just gone. There's nothing much to look forward to. I'm not sure if he feels the same way (I'm a little hesitant to broach the topic just yet), but I have a feeling it's more me than him. 

I guess what I wanna ask is if anyone who's been in a relationship for long (up to you to define what ""long"" is, but relatably, about 2 years) has ever gone through this...

After this year, our school will close down for good, and I guess that will be the last place with our memories that will close up. I really enjoyed my time with you.

I know we were both in bad places at the time, and that we were in really bad relationships at the time too, and I guess we both just sought comfort in someone else who knew what it felt like too. I knew she was cheating on you, and I guess I just wanted someone who knew what I was going through as well.

We were both misguided people. The first time I saw you I thought you looked cool with that camera, running around taking photos; you looked oh so popular, stopping every now and then to talk to someone and you seemed well liked by the teachers, your seniors and your level-mates. Has it really been 5 years since that day in J1?

I wanted to get to know you better. So I asked you to help me and my friends take a photo, and well, things took off from there. We spent afternoons studying together, and we told each other stories that we thought would never get out. We joked about everything, from the ugly bluish-green of the uniform to the strange expectations of the principal to random posts on confession pages (how ironic it is that I'm posting this on one) When she left you on read for a month I was there to cheer you up, and I guess it was then that our moments of weakness started. We just wanted some human contact, having been deprived of it for so long, and I guess having someone who understood so close by, it was hard to resist.

I think we both knew that it wasn't meant to be. But I caught feelings for you all the same. Every time you left my front door at the end of the day, it felt like I was missing something.

I distanced myself from you in J2, and you got involved with one of your CCA mates. I wondered about it, whether I should make a move on you, because I couldn't stand the sight of you guys being together. But I didn't. I was too scared to make that move.

And then it happened. Apparently your CCA mate hadn't broken up with her boyfriend yet before getting intimate with you, and things turned ugly. And I wanted to be there for you, but I didn't want you to see me as desperate, or for you to be seen as some fuckboy who changes girls oh-so-often. But we lost contact. Your Instagram disappeared in J2, and only recently have I found your new account. 

You're happily attached now. I guess I'm just too late.

I wish you all the best :), I hope we can still be friends, someday, and you can maybe introduce me to your girlfriend as a friend, because I guess that's as much as I can hope for now.

I'll just try to get over you as best I can then. I guess I'll have more chances to bump into you next year when Techno closes down, and if I do, I hope you won't be a stranger. You don't have to say anything, or even acknowledge what we were, but I hope we can still be friends. Hopefully I'd have my feelings for you all sorted out by then.

Last I heard he's keeping a 4.9 CAP, but during our relationship he'd go MIA too so perhaps it's working for him.

It was in the second year of JC that we broke up and while I understood that both of us had to focus on A levels being from a lower end JC (we got merged, even), I really hated the MIA period where he'd take like a day to reply to my messages, and sometimes reply only at the end of the week or so.

He'd tell me that we needed to focus on our studies, but I mean, we're in the same school, and the same CCA, so it's not really out of the way if we met up after classes... right? I thought I was being too clingy too, but I guess it just wasn't meant to be.

I guess he's moved on, he got attached to someone else less than a year ago, but I've not managed to form any lasting relationships since, and I think I'm still not over him.

I guess all I can say is do what you think is right? If you still have lingering feelings I guess it's best you work them out, with or without him.

He seemed to always just disappear into thin air after the lecture ended, which is strange since he sits in front of the class and always wears this black jacket so he kind of stands out if he moves, so I haven't had a chance to ask him out.

But I've recently just found out that he's attached and I'm crushed...

His girlfriend is so much better than me, she's attractive and athletic, I'm pretty sure smarter than me since she's from a better JC than I am, and even her figure is so much better? Like, she's got some really large assets... Kind of jealous on that point since I'm pretty much a runway.

I've just realised how pointless it is - I'm not very attractive, and my personality isn't really all that great either, and my favorite weapon to use is to paggro… There's really no way to get a decent boyfriend like this I guess.

here's some advice from one gay girl to another. the most obvious thing will be: does she have rainbow accessories? moving on from that, you might wanna see how she acts, if she's flagging (google it if you gotta!), if her clothes are on a list of 'top 20 clothes women wear that men hate', and lastly, if none of it works, pull out the big guns and flirt with her or ask her yourself. maybe get her number and work up to coming out to her on bringing up lgbt topics/issues and see what she says. you got this! and if it doesnt work out, don't worry but maybe you wanna check out the girls in other faculties as well?

So how in the world do most people just find their SOs so early and so easily?

Is it through dating apps like Tinder? Through friends?

My family has a lot of issues with finance and that really puts a lot of stress on me to work part time and study, as well as my course which is ""prestigious"" and has a really heavy workload. A lot of times I feel like we should break up simply because I'm not good enough. 

I do try my best to be a good girlfriend, like I will treat him to food sometimes (he insists on treating me food all the time, but I always insist we go on Dutch.), and I will play video games with him, and I just really want to be a good match for him, but I'm not. 

I'm ridden with mental illnesses, and I cry at least once a day while he takes time out of his busy schedule to comfort me. He's really popular, has many friends, is a responsible, warm, positive and kindhearted guy and I'm pretty sure quite a lot of girls like him. On top of that, he's good looking too. Meanwhile, I'm introverted, and I find it difficult to make friends. I stutter when I talk to new people. (Seeing the NUSWhispers post about a girl wanting to bed a higher than average guy from her course just so that he would break up with his very average gf makes me nervous. I feel like I'm that average gf.)

I just don't see what's good enough about me, (I don't think I'm very pretty) and I do want to suggest breaking up just so that he gets someone better than I am. Physically wise, I also have asthma and I get unwell easily, so he will drop his schedule just to take care of me and sit by my bed until I fall asleep, without asking for anything in return. He's always there for me, no matter how tired he is. 

I am trying to work on my depression and anxiety and get better for his sake, but it's just so hard to get up in the morning. Sometimes I don't tell him when I'm sad, because I know he will get really worried about me. 

What should I do? He deserves so much better than me, but I really do care so much for him. I'm just struggling so hard to handle everything along with my low self esteem.

Guys, be thankful to what you have in your life. Not everyone has that. I am single, came from another country to develop myself among the best community in Asia.

Having no 'real' friends here yet, I try to enjoy their company to the most. Trust me, they are not even friends according to my definition (every person always got some work, and I am always the one who manages the work to come for their proposed meet). I cannot blame them or tell them that they aren't my good friends, the fact is they are really bad at managing their time. Maybe I am habituated with what I had earlier, my friends from my homeland made me so much dependent on these connections that I still miss them.

I see these beautiful girls here, I feel like having an emotional relationship, and sharing my bed and thoughts with a girl. But as I do not have that (couldn't find THE ONE here, or maybe they didn't me), I try to engage myself traveling to new places most times or trying new things. Obviously, you cannot get everything, I can see that girls aren't interested in me (it's the beard - I have a great European beard which I am not shaving for a girl here). I would love to know some hiking spots here in Singapore.

I love NUS, it has provided me with the best resources in the country: talk about U-Town! You can possibly get the best lifestyle possible here. Gym, Sports, Food, Cafes, Greenery, best residences, everything under some hundred meters. 

Obviously, everyone has negative experiences, even I do -- nobody's living without problems -- it's a sinusoidal wave. But why tell those to people here on a social group who don't even know you and your emotional situation or condition. Instead, talk to your close ones regarding the same. These social groups aren't going to help you. Fking be thankful for what you have! Be happy and be high on euphoria dude. It's that time to develop into something better. This definitely ain't coming back.

1853,"Reading #53672 on a cool rainswept evening brought back bittersweet memories from a distant past. Many years ago, I too was young and, like many of the youths here, filled with these dilemmas of ""does she like me back"", ""should I ask her"", ""will we work out"", etc. I met this girl at college and we clicked so well and had such similar interests and outlook in life, that our friends always teased us and thought that we were a couple or about to be a couple. We went for meals and movies together, hung out, texted etc but ... I never asked her the question as I was unsure if she liked me back in that way. In a way, I also didn't feel sexually attracted to her and saw her (back then) as more of a sister, although I knew even then that rationally we would have made a great couple as we shared so many similarities in terms of perspectives, temperament, religion, family background etc. 

Life took its course: college ended, we went separate ways at university, and we began to drift apart, though we still kept in touch, visited each other at our halls, and met up during the vacations. We both graduated and got professional jobs. We stayed in touch and met up for dinners on weekends, and even then I hesitated to ask as I was unsure whether she saw me as more than a friend. I also wondered if she would settle for me (despite our similarities, her family situation is slightly better off) and I told myself that I doubted my readiness to commit. Obviously she never asked either.

Seasons passed and one day she told me that she was getting married. Well, I wasn't really surprised of course as she was eligible, and there was no reason to suppose she wouldn't move on in life at some point. I wished her well, although I did not think I wanted to attend the wedding and so I made up an excuse. We did schedule one last meet-up before that, in the presence of her fiance. I was very glad to see at least that he seems a fine young man who will give her the sort of life and happiness that I, a struggling graduate student, would probably not be able to provide. Unlike you, I never got to ask her the question whether she ever felt for me and whether we ever could have worked out if I had asked back then, when we were close. I felt it would have been awkward, and pretty selfish, to ask for the sake of my own closure when she was already engaged, so I simply wished the happy couple well, and I never contacted her again ever since. Also, unlike you, I never found another, and so today the loves of my life are only my immediate family, my work (which I do love a lot), my former students, and the campus cats.

The purpose of writing this is to tell those of you out there, especially the guys, not to overthink and not to hesitate too much in the prime of life. It is easy to make up excuses for not asking and for not taking the friendship a step further, but remember that inaction has consequences too, many of them irreversible. If you want a partner/spouse, you have to go for it, you have to risk some things. Looking at many of the earlier posts expressing doubts and uncertainty on this page I just want to say, from the perspective of one who's been through that phase and unfortunately missed the boat, that:

yet as you walk along the streets,
as you take the mrt,
as you sat in the library,
you constantly search for signs of her,
looking at the backs of people,
hoping it was her,
even though you know,
she's not going to be yours.

1855,"To all the confused souls who have a crush on someone but are unsure if you should confess or not, i'd like to share an experience i had with you.

Many, many years ago, there was this girl i liked (quite a lot tbh) who i used to text alot with. It was enough to make all our friends start teasing us and it was obvious to everyone that there was something going on between us. However, behind the scenes, I was really unsure what was really going on. Were we just normal friends texting or was it more? I was super awkward so i have never once asked her out, and when people asked i just denied. So did she. While texting i did send her some hint-ish msgs but her replies did not really show any clear signs.

Days turned into months, and months turned into years. We slowly drifted apart, especially since we went on different paths of life. One day, i decided to not start a convo (usually i start convos, but sometimes she does too - which made it super confusing), but she did not text first. I was really hoping she would, but the text never came. I decided that it was a sign that we were not meant to be and moved on (it might sound easy but it was really, really hard to let go).

Many years later, (somehow or rather) I asked her and she told me that she did indeed have feelings for me. I found out that she was worried about the same things as me - if either of us were wrong, we might become really awkward around each other and the thing was we were in the same clique of friends. So neither of us took the risk and now... it's all just regrets. I have no idea if she was truthful saying that she had feelings for me too or not (she might be just trying not to break my heart since the past is the past), but honestly, i'd prefer her to have said she did not, which i could appease myself by saying that thank god i didnt make any move. I was a wreck for the next (idk how long), and it was all just a sour mess in my heart. Even till now, even though i'm happily attached to my current gf, there is still a tinge of sourness whenever i think about it. But life goes on, and regrets follow you till the end. 

Tbh, I have still not made peace with myself not going for it. I've tried convincing myself with all sorts of reasons (she's too good for me(which is true and also why i hesitated so much), we were not compatible, she deserves better, etc), but it wont work. The opportunity to even give it a try is long gone now. I know i'm happily attached and i shouldn't feel this way but it's just the what ifs that remind me constantly that i screwed up.

Again, life goes on, and this is gonna be a regret i have to live with. My heart goes out whole-heartedly to my gf, but i believe that there will always be a special place in my heart left for her. I feel like a piece of shit but it's true.

TLDR; if you are still reading this, thank you for your support, it was really hard writing it. If you have skipped all the way here, hi. Lesson learnt - if you are unsure, just go and find out. Most of the times, it just takes a moment of yolo to pop the question- Wanna go out with me for dinner? Will you consider going on a date with me? Even 'What do you see me as?' or 'What are we?'. Once the question is asked, let nature take its course and there's no turning back. What's the worse that can happen? Rejection? Awkward with each other? Awkward with friends? I'd choose those over my regret any other day.

1856,"People are worried about the closure of techno edge because of the food... But I'm worried because this just means I have to go over to engin to buy my breakfast and lunch... And I risk bumping into my ex there.

It's not that I haven't seen him around at techno, sometimes I see him with his girlfriend and his group of friends sitting in one group across a couple of tables, sometimes it's just him and his girlfriend having an early lunch.

But techno is sort of a large place and I can easily avoid him by sitting on a different level.

If I need to go over to engin and the rather much smaller E2 cafe they're moving some of the stalls to, I'm definitely going to bump into him and his group of friends some day and it'll definitely be awkward.

We broke up after A levels, but still saw each other on and off through his NS stint, but things have been rather awkward since seeing him in school with his new girlfriend. They seem to have a lot more chemistry than we did and it just hurts to see him happy with someone else.

I haven't talked to him in a while, and it's definitely awkward for me to meet him, especially since the reason we broke up was because I failed to communicate with him and gave lip service to his advice... I feel terrible that it ended this way, and I regret making the decisions that I did.

I don't want to spend my next 2 years dodging people and looking left and right when buying lunch or getting someone else altogether to get food for me just to avoid meeting him...

I just want to hide somewhere and hide my face from him because I just can't face him like this. I should never have let him go and I feel so bad about this entire situation.

Everyone was shocked and thought that it was cruel of me to break up this relationship abruptly, but it was for your benefit. All the dates always contain moments of awkwardness and tension. It really crushed me when you told me you couldn't see a future with me. Yet, you were scared of being the bad one for breaking up with a 'good' guy. 
Nowadays, I have seen you often posting pictures of you having a great time with your new love, which can be quite painful when I scroll through facebook or insta. I have not moved on, but hopefully i will,in due time. Goodbye and last long in your new relationship.

We would talk to each other almost every single day(provided one of us is willing to initiate a convo) but i honestly cant tell if he likes me or not.. perhaps its just me??

He has never ever said that i'm pretty nor has he ever praised me before.. All he does is just tease me saying that im fat and short and resembles a pig (in a jokingly matter, ofcourse but sometimes it makes me abit sad) He'd talk about the pretty girl he met in the library or just point out pretty girls he spot around the campus everytime we're together.. We have never ever made it clear what exactly is our relationship but i have always been treating him like a best friend because I'm afraid that confessing my feelings would just end up ruining the friendship as I'm not sure about how he feels about me. I have tried hinting him to make clear our relationship but he the things he does everyday just makes me more and more confused.. he'd get jealous when a guy comes too close to me and even get mad at people who tried to hit on me just because they're lonely but best friends does this to each other too dont they???? Some days he'd use some random pickup lines on me and then proceeding to tell me he's just testing out on me so he can enhance his skill and pick up girls for real like seriously ?????

1864,"Just a rant here after reading an assortment of posts and misogynistic comments. Apologies for the length (pun intended). 

Honestly, your dick size should not generally have that much influence on how much love and affection your girl has for you (anomalies do apply of course). 

What matters from what what i’ve Observed, at least on the sex perspective, is how you treat your girl.  Do you love and respect her? Do you reciprocate? As cliched as this sounds, and it probably does, are you a good partner? Do you try to be that guy whom she feels safe, cherished and happy with? Are you the understanding and supportive partner who encourages her to partake in activities like a part-time job, even though it might potentially result in less time for the both of you, because you KNOW it’s for her own good? Or are you that asshole who insists on gratification at the expense of her discomfort? Are you that selfish partner who lies in bed, expecting to be pleasured and then assume that she’d be alright with settling herself? Are you that jerk who insists on sex every time, be it via guilt tripping, pleading or forcing, you must have your girl pleasure you, even when she’s uncomfortable, like if she’s on her period? 

Some of my buddies hate giving oral but love receiving it. Where’s the fairness in that? They claim it’s disgusting; it’s tiring...to hell with All that. Your girl puts up with the same shit by sucking and licking yours, is it too much to ask to reciprocate? Worse still for those who force their partners to do certain things; let insisting to cum in their mouth. Don’t get me wrong, it feels awesome and it’s so satisfying, some times it’s even better than sex. If they like it, good for you! But if they don’t, WTF do you still insist? 

It might sound like it doesn’t matter, but a little consideration and care goes a long way. I love my girlfriend, and even at the expense of being teased by my mates that i’m whipped or that I can afford to be more demanding, i’d still stick with what I do now. I’m happy that she’s happy, i’m glad that she enjoys sex as much as I do. Be that partner she deserves; be that partner she’s proud of. If you can’t respect that, then it doesn’t matter what size dick you have, you’ll always be that shit partner who’s not only bad in the sack, but also a terrible, jerk-ass boyfriend. Don’t blame her for dumping your ass, blame yourself for being one.

1869,"#53336 To Mr. P.

I broke up with you because you were just as unaccommodating. I accommodated you, went over to your workplace on the other side of Singapore, went to school on holidays to see you because you were ""busy"", went over to your place a fair amount of times, only for you to continue working and ignore me in all of the times I listed above.

I know your design degree is tough. I know your workload is heavy. I didn't complain because I knew you were working hard for your submission. When you graduated last year, I was truly happy for you. I wanted to bring you out for dinner after commencement, but what did you say? You told me that you wanted to go out with your friends. So I relented, it's going to be the last time in a while you'll see them. But for the entire month afterward, you didn't want to meet. You wanted me to come over because you were ""tired"". You were at home, your insta story shows you cleaning your fish bowl and you tell me you're tired? After you started working, it was impossible to get a hold of you at all. You were always at the office, on weekends too. My friends in your firm tell me your schedule is nowhere near as hectic as you make it out to be. You tell me inspections last till 6pm? My friends' instastories show you and them knocking off at 3pm. You wanted to know how I know? Now you do.

I work part-time. I can't leave work until 1, and your house is on the other end of the purple line to my workplace and my house. You never want me to stay for dinner. I've never met your mother, or your father in the one and a half years we were together. And the one time I came over after work, I arrived at 3, and you chased me out before 4 because we were done having sex. I'm your girlfriend, not a call girl. That entire incident made me think you're just with me for the sex. And you ask why I don't initiate sex?

Despite all these things, you never once gave me any help. My parents are strongly religious, and you are a ""free thinker"". When you come over, you don't talk to them, and you keep quiet when they try to talk to you. Think for me, I begged you, don't put me in a spot. But you told me that ""I am the way I am, your parents are just going to have to accept it"". So I stopped inviting you over. 

I got angry at you choosing to show up at our date half an hour late, without any warning. I got angry at you ignoring my texts and calls. I got angry at you happily texting another girl while I was talking to you and you didn't pay ANY attention to me for the whole date. Are all of these things ""small things"" to you? You complain and guilt trip me when I text my male friends, but somehow because it's you, you can text members of the opposite sex just fine?

I'm needy for meeting once a week? You never want to do anything, and if we go over to your place, you'll just be playing your games, after you ask me for sex and I decline. Of course I'll ask you to go somewhere else, if not you'll just spend your time ignoring me.

You complain to me about everything and I lend a listening ear, but you won't listen to my problems, telling me that ""it's nothing la"" and ""like that only?"". I open up to you and you dismiss my concerns? You'd rather watch your videos than listen to me talk? How disrespectful can you get?

I've raised breaking up with you many times. This breakup was a long time coming. Each time I chose to give you another chance, but you didn't make good on it. My friends told me that you were egotistical and selfish, and that's why they told me to break up with you. I guess they were right. Why the hell would you want to be introduced to them anyway? You think all my friends are ""rabak"" anyway.

This new guy? I got together with him a couple months later, not a week. Don't exaggerate like you always do. He's patient, unlike you, and he tries to work things through. He's not religious, but he tries to show respect. He talks to me. He accommodates me, and so I am more than willing to repay the favour. He's everything you never were.

I'm very happy with him. I hope you find happiness too.

Yours Sincerely,
M.

1873,"Why does my ex favour her current boyfriend so much more and treats him so much better than she treated me? Taking for example sexual matters, she has never initiated sex and through our 1 year long relationship sex was probably a once-a-month thing and we didn't even start till the fourth or fifth month. But with her current boyfriend it sounds like they have a very active sex life? From what I hear from our mutual friends it sounds like she goes home with him every day.

Then throughout the course of our relationship she insisted on at least getting me to conform to her family's expectations, meeting them regularly and all sorts of things including talking to me about converting because we belong to different religions. Every time we meet up it has to be to go out somewhere first, never just only to hang out at her or my house, and I've rarely been invited to her house. When I was busy with work, and sometimes I really don't want to go out, she won't be accommodating and come over to meet me? There was even a few months before we broke up that she wouldn't come see me because it was far, and she cancelled plans to go meet up after we broke up.
It's like she was ashamed to be dating me.

She would always be very needy and want to meet about once a week, and sometimes would just get angry at all the little things, so there were a few times I decided I needed to make a statement that I'm not going to take this kind of bullshit and walked off, leaving her there. But with this new guy it seems like they never fight?

Closer to the end of the relationship he suddenly came into the picture and without any warning she just broke up with me? Less than a week later by my estimate, they got together. It's not even funny that her ""friends"" (she has a large WhatsApp group of people that used to play CoC with her) keep telling her to break up with me? But they seem so passive with this guy? She's introduced him to all her friends, even to people I've never met? It seems like in a short few months he's a bigger part of her life than I ever was?

Why is she so much more accommodating to him than she was to me?

I have.

Funny thing was, the breakup was mutual. We both knew we'd be better off without each other, with someone else. It was a peaceful one, one where both of us finally accepted the fact in silence. I thought we could remain as distant friends after that, but somehow he acted really coldly and rather rude towards me. At that point in time, I was just taken aback but just shrugged it off; I mean if he doesn't want to be friends, what else could I do, right?

What's even funnier was that I actually still felt really thankful for the relationship even after we broke up. I mean, it wasn't all that good, but we had our good times. I tried really hard to solve the problems we had, and so did he. Just because we failed to keep our relationship didn't mean that it wasn't valid for the past few years. 

The funniest of all is that he actually started to talk shit about me in front of our friends, and his family. The thing is, none of them are even true, he twisted the truth such it was unrecognisable from the original events that happened, just to paint me in a bad light and make people think that I was the crazy one. Like, I never ever expected these actions to come from him. Maybe there were things I didn't know about him, perhaps I did not understand him that well, but this is about one's moral character, which is something I 100% trusted he had. 

Boy am I glad that I ran far away from someone like that. It's so scary how someone can just change 180 degrees suddenly.
