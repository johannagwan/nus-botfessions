1,"It has been 2 years since we broke up and for the past 2 years i have tried to forget about it and moved on with my life. I got myself busy with work and seeked self-improvement. For some time, I didn't had any issues and able to commit myself into work and focus on life goals.

But for the past few days, all of the sudden I had flashbacks of the time when we were together and I can't seem to focus with my daily tasks and spent time thinking about it ..

How can I overcome this?

2,"I have always been an independent person and I always eat alone, since I dont feel the need for company. 

Lately when I was eating alone at canteen, one team mate saw me and he decided to join my table and we ate together. (Im a girl and Im sure he is not interested in me since he forgotten we had lunch together the next time we chatted).

That was when I realized the joy of having someone to have meal with. These days when I see people sitting alone playing phone, I really have the urge to join the table and strike a conversation but I worry that people (especially guys) may think I have other intention...

What do you guys think?
Maybe I should start a club for makan khakis and we can go as a group?

3,"hello, I’ve never really felt the need to express my feelings on a platform like this but recently I’ve felt like it’s gotten worse and I can’t bear them anymore.

I’ve been always an optimistic kid and would try to help others as much as I can. However, during my secondary/poly school years, I got bullied by a group of girls and because they were considered popular, many guys who were friends with them had the same feelings towards me as well, this would eventually escalate and lead to my inability to even utter a word to the opposite sex or anyone who seemed remotely popular. I became a shell of who I used to be, and omitted myself from as many activities as possible. I hated the times where Teachers told us to choose our teams as I knew I would be a leftover. This shattered my self confidence and esteem, and I withdrew even further inwards. The breaking point came when I overheard a ghastly untrue rumor spread by one of my bullies few years after the apparent initial rumor started. At that point, I literally felt everything keeping me afloat disintegrate. How has it been so many years and why has such a ridiculous rumor even last till now.
By then, I refrained my actions and words to anyone, and kept to a minimum.

Since then, I’ve made it into university, I would never have thought I got this far. I still remain as quiet, and dislike speaking in public. I do not use social media to interact with classmates etc. 
Recently, I did a group project and I could not get along with my team members due to differences in goal-setting and standards of academic writing. Which was why when the time came for another project, I became another leftover. Although it may have been my fault for not being able to comply with my members work, I did pull more than my own weight in the project and did a huge percentage of the work.

I feel really disheartened and have been contemplating suicide for a long time now. I know it’s my fault that I’m this way, but I hope people understand that my circumstances have conditioned me to become this way. I came into Uni, hoping I could start afresh, but I feel like complete and utter sh*t, for lack of a better word. 

People have told me to change myself, but it’s easier said than done. I really don’t know what to do. I don’t know how I’m going to continue on.

Even all of my guy friends told me that they were apprehensive to approach me before they known me yet. Those girls who I tried to initiate convo with mostly find some excuses to end the convo quickly or show some uncomfortable look. I also come from a low income background and could not afford to buy good looking clothes and groom myself. The only thing I can offer a girl is perhaps honesty and sincerity as that is always how I have treated all my friendships. The problem is that with all the girls scared off by my looks, how can I ever think of getting one to know each other better?

9,"To be honest, it feels like I have come so far till the point now in NUS. Meaning I just feel like I am not as ""pure"" as before, and I have the tendency of wanting people to change perceptions of me.

Just a background of myself. I used to study overseas during my nursery and kindergarten, where English was not my first language. Only since primary school, I have always been studying in Singapore. As I was mostly home during those periods where my parents were working day in day out, I had never really socialise with other children. I did not even know how to communicate with them and not even knowing how to make friends. 

This got worse in primary school where i suffered bullying for about 3 years, where i had the naive thinking that if I was nice to anybody regardless bullies or not, they will appreciate me one day. But no, this never happened and school had been hell for me. They even criticised my looks and me being ""weird"". My mum found out one day that i was bullied and told me to be harsh if need be. I totally changed my attitude towards people, changed my looks by dressing more appropriately and etc and even focusing on building close connections. Of course in between I had experienced some ups and downs during my connection with people, such as betrayals and even those with toxic mentality. 

Thus I feel like I have changed in terms of how i interact with people. This is good for me personally as I have more people to communicate with and etc. But what I have noticed is, based on my past experience of making such connections, I just cannot help but have the tendency to always change myself(such as looks, personality and etc) as compared to how people usually view me. For example my secondary school friend had the thinking initially that I was always very quiet, not dressing up. But now in the same uni, she saw me and commented that I look and act totally different of how she viewed me initially. Even towards the bullies in the past, I kept making sure I look better and do much better than them even though i tried my best not to bother about them. However after meeting them, I then focus on how to make myself even better than before and change their perceptions for the better. In short, I seem to bother more about people's opinions and impressions of me, when I am trying my best to love myself by just being myself. Instead it feels quite pressurising at times having these tendencies. Sighs...

15,"Since i was 13 i was bullied for my looks and i was deemed as unattractive thru out my whole secondary school life, once i had a crush said to someone that he would be with me if i was at least average looking. I heard that and it was like a stab in the wound tbh, back then i really hated how i look and would stare in the mirror scratching my face trying to peel it off  or at least hope for a miracle to look decent. Fast forward to poly life i started wearing makeup and dress provocatively to make myself look at least average but suddenly i was labeled as ""hot"" or ""cute"" and it was really nice to hear those compliments tbh. i started having my first bf and 7 more exes which instanly boost my self esteem up and i was more confident in admitting that i was goodlooking however i was never arrogant about it and i would often compliement how people look too. It was nice for a while until i met my recent friends who are a group of guys they are judgemental and mean and would often judge girls if they are goodlooking or not and thats basically what i see most guys do as well. It made me really upset when they say stuff like "" ur bf has a low libido because his with u"" or "" my ex was cute unlike (my name)"" ik its just their opinon but im really sensitive to how people comment on my looks and its killing me to know im back to how unattractive i was again.

16,"To confession #75084, 

I was bullied in Primary school. But I could not rmb what happened. I had suppressed part of my memory. Till now, I often have weird dreams about what actually happened.

I was bullied in secondary school. I was cyberbullied by my cca friend. And because of this, I became a weird person. I hate people approaching me. I hated myself and I tortured myself. I felt that no one really understand how I feel. I got really scared to make friends with people. Some of classmates made friend with me, but after telling them a small little secret which isn’t even true, they just spread hurtful words around in school. And because of that, I was famous in school and everyone hated me. I felt that I became a loner myself. I got very affected in my studies that I could not concentrate easily. 

When I went to ite, my senior that was in the same secondary school as me, spread gossips about me in class. Ended up everyone hated me and I became a loner myself. In my second yr, my sec sch senior even said a gossip about me right in front of me. I hated her. I wanted to give her a tight slap. And I have one sentence for her: YOU HATE ME, I HATE YOU TOO!! 

Now in poly, no one in the class seems to be willing to make friends with me. I am always quiet in class. And it seems very difficult for me to step out of my comfort zone. Cos the moment I step out, everyone starts judging me. Nevertheless, I am not gonna step out of my zone. Wish me all the best. A lot of people told me I need to step out of my comfort zone some day. But, I refused to. I only want to say: what’s the point of stepping out of my zone when everyone like to judge me about what I do? CANT YOU JUST LOOK AT YOURSELF AND JUDGE YOURSELF BEFORE YOU EVEN GIVE THE HECK TO JUDGE OTHERS? I KNOW IM A LONER, BUT WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU CAN JUDGE ME AND GOSSIP ABOUT ME AS AND WHEN YOU WANT? I HELPED YOU AND YOU GOSSIPED ABOUT ME. IS THAT HOW YOU THANK ME FOR HELPING YOU? IF THATS THE CASE, I MIGHT AS WELL DONT HELP YOU!

18,"As someone who graduated from university some years back, I can't stress enough the importance of having a good mentor. I wasn't from NUS, but my mentor was. You see, my mentor was the longtime CEO of the company I work in and he was a Jack Welch-type figure here. Suffice to say, many of our company's businesses were built up by him.

I was not his original protege. It was another person. Let's name him X. X was originally the COO to my mentor and was slated to take over when my mentor retires. However, X was caught dabbling in some backdoor transaction. My mentor then ousted X and made me his heir-apparent. After some time, my mentor retired and I took over as CEO. My time finally came, or so I thought.

Not long after I took over as CEO, X managed to return to the board of directors by convincing some shareholders to support him. However, I once again found X dabbling in yet another backdoor transaction, so I ousted him from the company again. I also tried to form some joint ventures with our smaller but more nimble competitor for synergies and got a foreign conglomerate to invest in our company. This must have incensed my mentor for he hated our smaller competitor. I am unsure how it happened but some company money somehow landed in my personal bank account. You don't look at the gift horse in the mouth, so I decided to spend the money to pamper my wife instead of on myself.

On the pretext that I somehow lined my pockets with company money, my mentor is now conspiring with X to oust me at the next shareholders' meeting. My wife is also not helping as she keeps wanting to advise me and repeatedly emphasises that I am the CEO with the power to snuff out this conspiracy asap. It's vexing and I now regret having treated my mentor with gratitude. To all you young ones, please open your eyes wide and clear when following someone as a mentor.

I don't suppose you students have an answer to corporate shenanigans, so I just need your help for a simpler question: my friend wants to buy either a yacht or a submarine as his latest toy. Which should he buy?

21,"I've been together with this guy for about half a year. At first I thought he was perfect for me, our values and future goals aligned well, and we have similar things we liked to do as well, which made it easy to talk and hang out. But the more we are together, the more I feel that we are incompatible after all. 

Though he does treat me well overall, I feel like he chose me for the sake of finding someone he could settle down with, instead of a partner he actually loves. I have asked him directly about this, which he neither confirmed nor denied, but gave a very roundabout answer which leads me to believe it is true. I know some people are okay with that and that's fine, but personally, a rs where you don't love your partner isn't quite for me. This made me super sad at first, but slowly that sadness is turning into annoyance somehow. We also tend to have a lot of misunderstanding when we talk about day to day stuff (I've never had such issue when communicating with any of my friends, or even any of the guys I used to date, but somehow we often have miscomms) , which is starting to get on my nerves sometimes. 

What makes breaking up difficult is that we have met each others families (which I now regret introducing him so early) and that he doesn't treat me badly per se. Should I just hold on and try for this or is there no point?

If you have not been working for 6 months because previously, due to some issues (toxic boss at work which affects mental health), you decided to quit your job even though the benefits were good. In between, you went to travel around, and do other things to recollect yourself.

30,"Sorry, long post ahead.

I'm tired of feeling lonely. I don't really have any clique I belong to nor have I had a close friend, for as long as I could remember. 

In primary school, I was constantly bullied. Nobody really liked me, or at least I felt that way. All I could remember was having lunch alone because no one wanted to have lunch with me. Maybe I could also tell from the fact that my class photo during Primary 6 had two versions: one with everyone visibly seen, that was given to me, and another without me in it, given to everyone else in the class.

In secondary school, I've decided to not let my past affect me and tried to make new friends. Sure, I've made casual friends but none I felt connected to. I never get invited to hang out with friends after school and when I was the one doing the invite, everyone suddenly became busy.

In poly, I've had groups of friends that I hang with during classes, but I've always felt like the outside. It was obvious that my friends had their inside jokes and stories. I could still remember the day I felt heartbroken after finding out that we had 2 WhatsApp groups, one with me and another without. That was probably the first time I started to wonder if there's anything wrong with me all this while. Am I annoying? Am I boring? Am I unlikeable? 

NUS days were when things started to feel exponentially worse. I didn't join camps as I was still in NS during that time. So, when I started my first week in NUS, everyone I saw was already in a clique of their own. Maybe it was the anxiety in me or my past experience with people, but I did not dare to approach anyone in class. I'm always sitting alone in lectures and tutorial classes. In between classes, I have my meals in canteen by myself, watching students walk by. At the end of the day, I'm just on the MRT on the way home. Sure, I've interacted with others during group projects, but the interactions stop there. After my last exam paper of every semester, I would watch people talking about going out to celebrate and all I did was just going home and celebrating by myself. I remembered 'celebrating' on my own after my first semester by eating alone at a restaurant. I also remembered crying myself to sleep that night. 

Having been in my first job for about 6 months, I've never felt lonelier. Sure, I'm friends with some of my colleagues but like my previous phases in life, I've felt that the level of friendship is imbalanced. I'm always trying so hard to be close to them, but I know they don't feel as close. Maybe I'm too clingy. Maybe I'm trying too hard that it scares them away. My current routine is just going to work and going home and the cycle repeats. No telegram/WhatsApp messages. No random conversations with friends. No chats with family members at home (We're not very close). I do make the initiative to meet up with friends sometimes, but it rarely happens. 

I’ve tried out new activities/hobbies to distract myself, but the loneliness has recently felt overwhelming. I wanted to try getting to know new people through meetup groups, but I'm so afraid to do so now. 26 years of loneliness has made me feel that I'm terrible at friendships. Every new person I meet is going to be a friend for that phase of my life and just leave afterwards. I try so hard not to have that mentality with every new person I meet but that has always been end result. The weird thing is that a lot of people I've met mentioned things like ""You're so friendly"", ""Why are you so nice?"", ""You're such an easy person to talk to"" but now I'm wondering if all these are just white lies. Maybe they're just statements to cover up for something terrible about me? I'll never know because we don't talk anymore.

I guess the reason why I'm bringing this up recently is because I'm starting to notice changes to myself. I've been getting much more exhausted and unmotivated with more things in life. I tend to stutter whenever I speak now, and my command of language is becoming pretty bad. I know I need help. As I don't have close friends to talk to, I wanted to share it here just to let someone know. Anyone.

I'm tired of feeling lonely. To those I’ve met before, I'm sorry if I was a terrible person to be friends with. To everyone else, please give me a chance.

31,"Does anyone else think it’s becoming more and more challenging to live and communicate with parents as one grows older?
I’ve been quarrelling a lot with my mother lately and it feels so emotionally draining. Probably a part of it is my problem as I’ve been facing a lot of stress at work lately and it’s affecting my mood when i’m at home with my family. But I guess she can be very unreasonable at times too. Let me give some examples to illustrate.
She’s a clean freak bordering on OCD. Every day when I come home from work, instead of asking about how my day went, she’ll nag about how my cleaning is not up to standard, things in my room are not where they’re supposed to be, some of my clothes not ironed immediately after washing, the floor is perpetually dusty...and many more of such trivial stuff. Well, I certainly would do a better job if I’m a full time housekeeper, but I’m not! It’s hard for me just to have peace and quiet after a long day at work.
She’s been a very authoritative parent since I was young and it doesn’t change now that I’m a working adult. She’ll dictate what time I should go to bed and wake up, take my meals and shower. And openly voice her displeasure if I don’t obey or try to reason with her. Sometimes she even makes comments about my outfit and won’t stop until I change to something she prefers. Aren’t all these too much now that I’m all grown up?
At home I totally have no privacy. She’ll open my cupboard and drawers as and when she pleases, and sometimes discards things that she deem not useful without asking for my permission. She’ll judge me on the stuff I have / bought (e.g “I found .... in your drawer, you bought yourself ah? Or someone gave you? Gosh, it’s so ugly.”). Don’t understand why she must do such things, sigh. 
The worst thing is that she nags at me endlessly for being single and not proactively looking for a bf. She’ll keep hinting at how many of her friends have become grandmas, and sometimes when she’s unwell or in bad mood she’ll loudly exclaim, “Aiya wanna die also cannot die in peace, my daughter still not married,” making me feel bad like I’m such a burden in her life :( Well, the reason I’m single now is that I used to get cheated on by my long term bf 2 yrs ago and I’m still living with the trauma until now, so I feel very deeply hurt when she says such things...
I do not despise my mother in any way, deep down I still love and respect her. Just that at times I got really frustrated and in desperate need for some space, autonomy and privacy now that I’m a working adult. And I wish she won’t keep forcing me to find a bf when I’m not ready.
Any suggestions on how to deal with such a parent will be much appreciated. Unfortunately moving out is not an option as I’m not earning much and don’t think I can afford the rent.

33,"Sorry in advance: long post to which I'm tearing to...I dont even know why but it's just a rush of past feelings. 

I've been with my boyfriend for about 6 years now. We have been good but the beginning was pretty hard...I thought I got better but the insecurities are coming back. 
*
A little background: He is verrryy good looking - albeit singaporean, people would often ask if he is local (don't know why the heck singaporeans don't think singaporean guys can be good looking) and compliment his looks. 
I'm average I would say, but definitely not model look material. But also, I had no qualms over his above average looks or this attention. Partly because I thought I was very secure (based on my past relationships) and thought this would be the same. He also chased me for quite a long period as I was initially not keen in a rhsp. 

Although, sometimes it stung a little - when we went out, people would compliment his looks. When we go to family gatherings, people would again compliment his looks. I get the compliments but sometimes I feel it's just for the sake of. And guys are not the only ones who would chase attached girls...I've had other girls try to squeeze their way into our relationship to get his attention (attempt to initiate physical contact in a sexual manner, text daily etc).

But I always reminded myself that we both have our strengths, I'm the brain of the relationship and have had charted a successful pathway for myself (I've helped him build his intelligence appetite largely too). But no one really sees that. Cause yes..looks win. 

And in the beginning of our relationship, he did give in to the attention from girls (reply their messages, flirt back) because it was new to him (coming from a boys school) and so I turned from being a super secure girl to a pretty insecure one. We had huge fights...and since then, I've always had this tiny insecurity streak in me. I let it go through lots of talk with him (he has drawn boundaries and have been loyal) and self reflection but I always have this doubt that he has a upper hand, and can, and MAY cheat. 

Presently...

He started working (he has always worked in a male dominated env) and not surprisingly, the attention has begun and girls have began throwing themselves at him. He used to be pretty naive & assumed this actions (from obviously interested girls) were not to lead him on but I'm a girl and I know. He has been telling me what they've been trying to do and his responses have been kept to a friendly manner but I just cant seem to trust him. He knows he is good looking and I'm afraid the attention gets to his head again and he starts to flirt back. I do feel disgusted at myself for being so insecure....but I'm so tired. 

I sometimes wish I wasn't dating such a good looking person because it makes feel like shit about myself and I feel that I'm not strong enough to deal with the shit that comes with it. All the thoughts and what ifs...should I just end it? 

Has anyone had a similar experience? How do you deal with it? I'm really hoping to salvage this relationship before my insecurities build again...because I foresee this to be a long term issue.

I was working part-time at a bubble tea store when this incident happened.

There was this customer who ordered bubble tea and requested for lesser sugar for his bubble tea. I made him a cup of bubble tea with 80% sugar. 

After taking a sip, he complaint to the senior staff that he requested for lesser sugar, but I didn't reduce the sugar level enough. His definition of lesser is 50%

Fortunately, the senior staff didn't blame me for it. It could be possible that that senior staff was a nice guy(definitely one of the reasons) or my senior staff felt that it wasn't my fault.

Do you all think it was my fault? I felt that the customer was partially at fault for using the vague word ""lesser"" instead telling me more clearly that he actually wanted 50% or half sugar.

48,"Dear guy
We decided to end this relationship. No, i think u decided to end it before i did. It doesn't matter anymore. You gave up too early, way too early. That made me sad. I was ready to keep trying as long as you are sure about me. But i could feel that you wasn't. All those harsh words u said to me. I thought u were only joking and that u didn't meant it. Only now did i realise that you had wanted to end it long ago, but u continued because u feared that i would be sad, because you saw how happy i was. I had seen u being happy with me. Was that a lie?

Have you seen the effort i put in, to try make you happy? I buy small stuff for you to show my support as you get through the tough and long hours of work. If i could, i would have cook or made something for you. I try not to complain or show negativity because I know how draining it gets when one is tired. When you are sick, all i wanted is to see you to ensure you are really okay. How many times have i boarded the train to your station, only to turn back because I knew you wouldn't have wanted me to do so. I brought you to meet my friends because i want you to feel assured that i wanted a future with you. How i wished we had more chance to have double dates. I took time out to meet you even though i was so tired and not feeling well. How many times did i crash in my bed the moment i settled down at home and yet i sounded so energetic in my texts? How many times do you know i was unwell and stressing to get myself well again so that we could meet as agreed? How many times did i thank you because i was afraid you would think that I'm taking you for granted. 

But how many times did you appreciate what i did for you? How many times did you encourage me when i felt like giving up.

All these because I want you to feel loved. But I didn't know what i need to do to make you happy. So i tried every possible ways i could think of. 
How many times did i reach out to you to communicate with me. All you did was to crack some jokes or change the topic to ignore my question. How much i wish to know more of your world and what you have been through - the good the bad and the things you did - the good and the bad. 

We both lost in this relationship. We lost to communication. 

And then it came to me that the best way to make you happy is to end this, no matter how much i didn't want to. I need to set you free. 

Maybe you were also disappointed in me in some way. But that i will never know. I'm sorry. I love you.

51,"What are your thoughts about a 100% inheritance tax regime, or in the alternative, that inheritance should be capped at a certain amount (e.g. $100,000)? 

1. Reducing Income Inequality
The first and most obvious consequence is the reduction of income inequality in the country. The rising income inequality has caused much unhappiness not just in Singapore but many countries around the world. In fact, one of the reasons for the civil unrest in Hong Kong was that there was a huge disparity in income between the classes of people where the few rich individuals hold much of the country’s wealth. With inheritance tax, the rich can no longer pass on their wealth to their offspring and this allows the country to redistribute the wealth in the country. While this may seem unfair to the ultra-rich, perhaps the welfare of the masses should take precedent over the interests of the ultra-rich who have already enjoyed their wealthy lives.  

2. Promoting meritocracy and encouraging hard work
The idea of meritocracy is that people are rewarded for their hard work, talent, efforts etc., rather than wealth or social class. The offspring of ultra-high net worth individuals would, upon the demise of their parents, inherit millions (if not billions) without accomplishing anything in life. This is unfair to those who slog all their lives but not accumulate even 1% of the inherited wealth and it is purely a game of luck – whether you are born in a rich or poor family. As everyone starts off from a fresh sheet of paper, people (including those from wealthy families) are motivated to work hard so that they can be rewarded in life. 

3. Allowing the state to fund for local universities
With the money collected from inheritance, the state can provide free university education to every Singaporean (like some European countries). This allows everyone to compete equally with the same level of education, further promoting meritocracy in the country. Currently, those who are less fortunate are unable to pursue further education due to the costs of education (a degree in local universities costs $25k to $50k).

4. Removal of other taxes like income tax and property tax 
The inheritance tax (which taxes the dead) can possibly replace the current income tax and property tax (which taxes the living). This is also the reason why inheritance tax has been dubbed the “fairest tax”. With the removal of living taxes, people can spend all the money that they have earned on the things they want. 

Potential arguments and counterarguments:
1. People can evade this by through gifts before they die – this can be resolved via gift tax.
2. People should be entitled to leave what they have saved to their offspring – this is a fair point but in exchange for giving up the inheritance the state provides free university education to every citizen to ensure that they can be self-sufficient. 
3. People can spend all their money before they die, leaving the state with no money – the state can still obtain its funds via GST (more revenue from GST as consumption increases). This also promotes the country’s economy through an increase in aggregate demand.
4. There is no point in putting money in CPF – the purpose of CPF is to ensure that citizens are self-sufficient after their retirement, rather than for the sake of passing the money down to their offspring. In any case, it may form part of the limit on the amount of inheritance as mentioned at the beginning. 


tldr: there are many benefits accruing from an inheritance tax regime, such as reduction in income inequality, promoting meritocracy, free university education, removal of living taxes etc. would you support inheritance tax?

Although I have a small group of good friends from JC and high school I really do treasure a lot, I don't have a lot of friends in uni to hang out with and it has been like this since I was a freshman. Sometimes it is difficult to hang with my closer friends because of school and some of them are in relationships too. I used to have a boyfriend who has graduated from nus, but we broke up. So my question is, how do people cope with loneliness? Sometimes I feel so alone, I will just sit in my bed and cry. Sometimes it even brings my focus away from my academics. It is kinda hard at times too seeing others in happy and committed relationships, because I do crave the intimacy and commitment that comes with relationships. Some guys showed interest in me but I wasn't really into any of them and being with someone solely to fill this void isn't a great idea. I tried looking for friends online but we just didn't really hit it off. I have been attempting to work on myself - travelling overseas alone, working out, reading and planning my study schedule for this semester. Yet everyday I still fall asleep and wake up with this emptiness in my heart. The only times I don't feel this way is when I am having fun with my close friends, on vacation with my family or when I had my ex with me. How do people lead fulfilling single lives without feeling like they have to wait for people to hang with them or a boyfriend they can love to come along?

55,"Sex before or after marriage, why does it even matter? 

If one takes a scroll through the comment sections of posts with the word “virgin” or “virginity” inside, the common consensus of those commenting are “its the 21st century why are you being so narrow minded”, or “go to IMH and seek help la”. The idea of pre-marital sex is oftentimes ridiculed on this platform, albeit sometimes there are neutral parties who rightfully so, asks the OP to “respect the partner’s wishes”.

Here is what i think about this issue, and if you frankly don’t care, feel free to scroll past this post. Firstly, I fully agree that virginity is a social construct, and deeming females as impure just because they engage in pre-marital sex is a ridiculous notion. However, I strongly believe that if someone wishes to date a virgin, or subscribe to the idea of post marital sex, their concerns and requirements should be seen as valid and acceptable, and not subject to ridicule as seen in the recent posts. 

As mentioned earlier, virginity is a social construct where our perspective on it is shaped by our education, experiences, peers, school, family and most importantly, oneself. So why are we trying to put people down with differing opinions and legitimate concerns? Why are we not more accepting of the differing ideas and moral values of other people? While i strongly disagree that pre-marital sex makes one impure or immoral, I find it shocking that people are labelling OP’s with differing opinions as “lonely and virgin forever”, or “crazy go to IMH la”.

And to those OP’s who are trying to convince their partners to change their mindset, please do so in a respectful manner. Like I have mentioned earlier, one’s perspective on virginity is based on a multitude of factors, and just because you are horny does not mean that she’s crazy or too strict. Please support your partner fully through this transition if that is really what you want, or respect each other’s wishes and wait.

I didn’t recognised the guy at first until I asked him if I knew him. He mentioned his name and introduced the girl besides him as his gf, suddenly the world dark for a while. He’s a guy from the same jc as me and he was my best friend. The fact that I forgot about him bcoz something had happened during college time. We were in the same water polo team and went for quite a number of tournaments. To make it fast forward, we were about to go on our own path, I ended up in NUS while he went to oversea to study.

Few days before he fly, he stayed at my home, had a few drinks, talked a lot on sports and out of nowhere, we ended up staring at each other. It was the time where I do realised he is such a fine guy, perhaps the most good looking guy I had ever seen that time. The fact that I never had a feelings to any guys but I don’t even know why he came into me. The basorexic feelings killing me, staring at his luscious lips, moving away my sight immediately after.

Out of sudden, his hand pulling my neck and brought my face near to his, ended up kissing each other. His lips so soft that I don’t even want to cut the kiss. We ended up cuddled on my bed while he was kissing me hardly. I never knew that the raging hormone of this young guy so strong. Maybe because we were drunk at that time but the fact that I able to remember each moment until now, I don’t think I am. We never talked about that night since then and we ended up losing in contact after.

Back to present, I was immersed in those memories until he called me by my name and asked me whether I am okay. I am okay after all these years without him. He asked me why I never in contact with him all these while and I don’t even know how to answer it. ‘It is good to see you, it has been a while’. It was an awkward short conversation, he was the one who is excited and I am blunt as always. We never talked about past time as I don’t want to think about it anymore. The fact that he is having a gf now, it is time for him to be happy. 

I ended up ordered my drink and sat somewhere else. He and his gf sat quite far from my table. Suddenly, a waiter came to me and handed a plate of croissant. I never ordered it but the waiter told me that the guy in white shirt ordered for me, He is my friend from earlier on and I looked at him from far, he looked at me and gave me a good smile. The waiter handed me together with a small notes given by my friend.

64,"I'm the OP of #74946, the one asking for ways to counteract workplace favouritism.

To provide abit more context (I really want to solve this issue I guess):

- No, my boss and Person A are not sleeping together FOR SURE. They are the same gender, both got their own families with children. 

- I've actually been with the firm for 5 years already. Person A has been with the firm for 6.5 years. For a mere 1.5year difference, I don't think the ROI matters that much. In fact, I was at my previous firm for 2.5 years and being with my current firm double the number of years speak volumes about my willingness to stay and stick around. To allay my boss' distrust, I've mentioned multiple times that I won't leave and I'm also bonded (the firm pays for all my upgrading qualifications, which I've continuously been taking for the past 5 years to better prep myself while Person A didn't) as a sign of my commitment. 

- And yes, I talk to my boss whether it's work-wise or personal-wise or career-wise. I have multiple projects with my boss. My boss knows my ultimate career goal - communicated it across several times, knows I'm working hard towards it and I will personally schedule time to talk about career progression, my views on the team (I already lead one), how we can do better, and just general catch up on life - I do notice that these sessions seem to be abit one-sided though, like it's coming alot more from my own proactiveness and initiative. Of course Person A does it too, but the boss always seem more receptive (like in a better mood after coming back from these coffee sessions with Person A).

- I've also tried being ""hard to replace"" like how one commenter mentioned - I put my hand up most frequently, do the projects that no one wants to do, standby during public holidays, help out with business development and things generally to be done outside of work hours (otherwise known as saikang lol), help out whenever the team is busy, and my juniors have given me glowing reviews year after year. These are things that Person A does not have. 

It has come to a point where I feel that I've tried hard and things are stagnated, for reasons beyond my comprehension and control. I'm really unsure what else I have to do to appease my boss, and sometimes I feel like a slave/taken for a ride. 

Tts why I feel that at the end of the day, nothing I've done will satisfy my boss, and nothing I do moving forward will. I'm not sure if anybody here has ever been in my shoes and managed to turn things around, if so, would really love to hear from u. Oh and thanks for reading, oops another long post.

69,"How do u tell whether a boss is practicing favouritism in the workplace and how do u counteract that?

Headsup, this is quite a long post ahead. 

I am an executive working in a global firm. There are also 4 other executives (ie same rank), and we are all quite similar in terms of educational background, with 1 - 2 yrs difference in age. The skillsets we have are also broadly the same, but  because we work on different projects, there are some differences in the kind of exposure and experience we had.

I've noticed that my boss is particularly nice to one of the executives (let's just call the person A). Now don't get me wrong, my boss is generally friendly and will smile/talk to others in a calm manner, not like those horrible bosses u see in movies.

By acts of niceness I mean: by giving A opportunities to speak up, only asking for A's views in meetings, letting A run the bigger projects most of the time, following up with A when A comes back from holidays and asking A whether A feels overwhelmed, need more staffing resources etc etc.

Even though it feels like my boss sometimes 'wakes up' and treats the other executives better as well (like asking if we also need resources or spends effort coaching us), I can't help but feel that boss prefers A based on the number of times that boss is nice to A. I am guessing that it is because the only difference between the rest of us and A is that - A is homegrown ie has started career in this firm and stayed on throughout. A is not the most experienced (in terms of number of years working in this line) amongst us. This 'loyal' trait is very similar to my boss' own background - staying in one firm throughout, while the rest of us started our careers elsewhere before moving to the present firm. Plus because there was a period of time when we had massive turnover, it seems to me that the boss is afraid of people leaving and therefore feels that only homegrown employees are loyal will stay long and can be groomed.

If this continues, I'm concerned that when it comes to promotions, pay rise and general career progression, the boss will favour A too, since A gets the best exposure, best resources and best learning experience and naturally would perform better. Is this considered favouritism in such situations, and what can I do for myself and my career? Prof Ben, any wise words?

72,"Saw some posts talking about being a mediocre worker and aiming for work life balance. I’m a supporter of this camp as well. I read that the median salary locally is about 4k. If I just stick to being an average worker and just get a job with the median salary for my whole life, I am already better than 50% of working people here right? Assuming that I am getting small increases to keep up with inflation but I won’t work hard for more. I believe there are people getting less than this amount who are able to go travel, buy a flat or have a family, no? I even seen some getting a car on this salary.

73,"OP of #74715 here.

Was reading every comment. Yeah I know it's pretty cringy and seemed unreal, but yes, what I described really was the situation. I do agree on the meet first, and yes, it will be public place like a normal meetup. 

One of the comment mentioned it might be game banter; game banter was with A, not B. B goes out of the way to remember and be concerned on little things I mentioned. He does it on his own accord, on the basis I had rejected him a couple of times previously. This was what touched me and I wasn't sure how to feel.

To clarify things, most of the comments seem to have mistaken my PoV. I have no intentions or whatsoever to come in between A and his wife. My only concern here is that I might be short-changing B and only liked B's care but not him as a person (Because I liked A previously). So it was more of a Do-I-give-both-of-us-a-chance situation or like one of the comment mentioned, since I wasn't physically-attracted from photo, he don't really deserve the lesser me. 

Sigh.

74,"I've been having a moral dilemma.
My girlfriend doesnt like me hanging out with a friend of mine mainly cause she sees him as shady (capable of cheating on his girlfriend and stuff like that) and has been overbearing whenever I hang out with him with constant calls just to check that I'm not doing anything shady as well. Shes firm about me not hanging out with him but I do fight for my rights cause hes one of my guys.
As such I've lied to her on a couple of occasions when I went out drinking with him and other friends but told her I was at home sleeping. 
However I have previously explained that whatever his morals may be regarding cheating or anything in that regard, doesnt compromise my own. He can ask me out to places with other girls and I've never made the decision to cheat on her both emotionally and physically.
As a result of this, she now constantly demands my live location and video calls me to check up on me that I am where I said I would be. This happens even when I'm with other (non shady) friends in her opinion. 
My problem is that I know she genuinely cares for me, but her paranoia is driving me pretty nuts, and I feel like I cant keep up if she keeps doing nonsense like check up on me, demanding to look at my messages and perform random interrogations when I'm with her. I want to give her that sense of trust but I cant give in to her demand of me letting go of a friend just cause she thinks he has shaky morals. 

Need some genuine advice on dealing with this TIA

76,"what should i do about being involved with a married man? we clicked super well platonically initially but he started to express interest. at that point, (knowing he was married) i just flirted back and enjoyed the attention. however there was a night we hung out alone + alcohol was involved and everything started there. it was really good, the best i’ve ever had (not that i’ve had much experience) and i told myself to just keep things physical but along the way i started getting emotionally attached. it’s bad enough to the point that now even if we don’t do anything i do look forward to seeing him and i miss him badly on weekends when he’s with his wife and doesn’t even text me the whole weekend. i’ve also tried to meet other men (single and available ones) but no one interests me like my married man does. i know i’m being ridiculous but i feel like i’m in too deep. he has mentioned repeatedly that his marriage comes first and i KNOW that but for some reason i can’t stop myself from continuing down this disastrous path. should i get therapy or something?

Sometimes high-flying, good looking guys just want to settle down with someone who might be considered avarage. I love my girl, and I don't need her to look amazing or be remarkable. I love her for the person she is, and I feel comfortable around her. And frankly that's all I need. You don't need to have very unique traits for a guy to love you. I'm not asking for much, and I don't think there's nothing wrong with that. But to the girl, it makes them insecure and constantly wondering why I love her. Of course I can't tell her I like her because she's average. But I just know I love her. I still don't know how to comfort my girl to this day.

88,"I refer to #74741 about the dude who has a gf with low-sex drive. I see many comments bashing the dude about how he does not respect her and how he needs to control himself. I think this post would have gotten a much more different reaction had the gender roles been switched.

I don't think the dude is wrong in thinking that they may be incompatible in the future. Sex is by and large a huge part of a relationship, and it is important when you want to go long term with your partner. Just because you prioritise sex does not mean you cannot control your urges - you just need to find someone who can communicate with you on the same level on this issue.

So here's my advice - if the issue (whether it be sex, religion, career or family) is high up on your list of things you consider important in a relationship, don't settle for less. Find someone who can see eye-to-eye with you on the important matters, because if you close one eye on them near the beginning of your relationship, these are the things that can cause a divide when the going gets tough. 

Communicate and make a decision. Don't settle just because you have committed time or money into a relationship. If it is that important to you, you will be able to find someone who can agree with you on it. 

TLDR: just because you love someone, does not mean that you let go of what is important to you.

It's quite obvious that she no longer has interest in this friendship/relationship for whatever reason. The question is are you affected enough to want to confront her about it? I'm assuming that if you are troubled enough to pen down your worries and post it here, you probably want a proper reason from her and perhaps closure.

It doesn't have to be weird : you could just ask her if something is bothering her lately and if not, why does it feel that she is ignoring you. If she answers you directly - CONGRATS OP!! If she doesn't, then it's really up to you to decide if you want to push her for your answers.

100,"@ The OP of #74787 :
Honestly, it sounds like the girl has lost interest in you. Either that, or she’s the type of girl (I’d know well, being one myself) who likes the chase. When you meet someone new, they are completely foreign and mysterious to you. It’s thrilling and exciting to talk to them. However, after a while, they become familiar to you and the excitement is gone. This is especially so if she had realised on some level that you already have feelings for her. 

My advice to you: Stop texting her and being at her beck and call. Don’t initiate any conversations or plans with her, but don’t completely ice her out if she makes a move on you. Simply put, only talk to her if she’s the one who talks to you first. Maybe get to know some other girls or at least make yourself look busy. Good luck!

However lately, she started getting paranoid about lying after seeing some of her cousins’ relationships wrecked because of lying. She even demanded that whoever caught lying in our relationship will be fined by the other person. To reassure her, I agreed.

Then for some ridiculous reasons, she started fining me a few times for “lying”. The most ridiculous fine was when I blurted out during an argument that she spent more time meeting her good guy friends than meeting me. She said I was lying because I didn’t take into account the other time she spent thinking about me but choosing to compare only the time physically meeting. 

I was incensed and demanded that she give me a breakdown on how much time she spent thinking about her good guy friends compared to that spent thinking about me. At this point she said she can give me the breakdown, but she counter-questioned me about my intentions for asking and implied that I don’t trust her even though she always has my back blah blah blah. She still refuses to give the breakdown. 

Should I get out of this relationship? I know I probably still have value on the dating market because some other girl has persistently pursued me (but she has money management issues).

Anything that I am doing, Anywhere that I am going, Where am I currently, Who I am with, I have to report it to her. Things get worst when she does not approve of the activities that I am doing. She does not like me playing mahjong cause her father was an addict, and shes afraid of me being one. Note here, I have only played mahjong as a fun and chill game. Not gamble. We ended up fighting because of that. 

Going to the gym can be difficult as she thinks that I will look at all the females there when I am exercising. She does not like me hanging out with girls (even girls that are attached), for fear that I might betray her. Sometimes, I am only hanging out with guys, and she isn’t happy about it. I have never cheated on her, and I only have eyes for her. When we talk about this topic, she claims that she is sensitive and insecure, but can’t she just trust me? 

I’m always paying for her share and buying her gifts. Why? As a china national, she claims that the guy must give gifts to the female every now and then as it is a “china thing.” Heck, I even had to buy a phone for her. My poor wallet.

Might be awkward if I want but she doesn't. I'm lost... How should I treat her or go about this tactfully? Even just as friends?

It seemed mutual. I thought we had a thing but it turns out she just completely ghosted me during the vacation. 

We were so close during the semester. I don't understand why she ghosted me. But maybe something happened or maybe she's just not in the mood? To be fair it could have been something I did that made her decide I don't want this guy. Looking back I realise I haven't really showed her feel loved in the way she wanted despite her hints. Maybe I should be understanding and give her the benefit of doubt. She seemed very genuine during the semester. Not like the kind of girl with a motive. 

But right now when I try to talk to her she'll seem cold and uninterested. We used to talk every day. Now she's not initiating convos and when I do, she'll give me one word replies. She seems like she doesn't want this anymore.

There'll prob be a lot of comments telling me to 'ditch her, u just got used' and everything but please don't. 

I still want this relationship (or friendship) and I treasure her as a person. I like her a lot. and there's the possibility that she's just going through something. I just don't want to assume that this is over cause it might not be.

I broke up a few months ago with my girlfriend of 6 months. It was me who broke it off knowing she wasn't the right person for me in the long run (it started getting too serious too soon). Her bestfriend somehow got into middle of this and confessed his love for her. I tried to give her space to figure things out but eventually decided that it wasn't worth it and broke up with her.
It was an ugly breakup even though I tried to keep it very straightforward. 
We blocked each other almost everywhere. However, now I know for a fact that both of them are together and it boils my blood. 
They jumped into the relationship just right after we broke up even though she used to tell me she never looked at him that way and never imagined being together with him. 
I would have been fine with it if it was someone else but knowing that she is with the guy who was somewhat a reason for our breakup makes me really mad. I keep getting these wild thoughts to ruin their relationship in some way or the other. 
I feel guilty for feeling that way. I thought I had moved on but the fact that it still bothers me knowing they are together, sleeping together says otherwise.
Obviously it must have been very easy for her to move on jumping from one relationship to other but it has been somewhat hard for me. 
I'm well surrounded with loving friends and family. Also I keep myself busy for most days with work. But the nights are the hardest. 

I keep switching to another IG account I created where I am following her to check her and that guy's post or stories. I know I should delete that account and try to move on but I just can't get myself to do it. 

Can someone share some advice. I really want to move on and leave both of them in the past.

112,"Dear Prof Ben and NUSWhispers community,

TLDR; Girl I like seemed to like me back during school term. Ghosted me during vacation. I don't think she's the kind that would use me but who knows. I want to continue whatever we had. Might be awkward if I want but she doesn't. I'm lost. How should I treat her or go about this tactfully? Even just as friends? 

There's this girl that I really like and have been helping her for homework during the semester. We were very close. She was not rejecting my romantic advances, and sometimes even reciprocating. It seemed mutual. I thought we had a thing but it turns out she just completely ghosted me during the vacation. 

We were so close during the semester. I don't understand why she ghosted me. But maybe something happened or maybe she's just not in the mood? To be fair it could have been something I did that made her decide I don't want this guy. Looking back I realise I haven't really showed her feel loved in the way she wanted despite her hints. Maybe I should be understanding and give her the benefit of doubt. She seemed very genuine during the semester. Not like the kind of girl with a motive. 

But right now when I try to talk to her she'll seem cold and uninterested. We used to talk every day. Now she's not initiating convos and when I do, she'll give me one word replies. She seems like she doesn't want this anymore.

Sometimes it makes me feel like I'm just being annoying and I trying to talk to her is just pestering her. It feels stupid trying to talk to her when she doesn't want to talk. I don't know what happened or if it's something I did wrong. 

There'll prob be a lot of comments telling me to 'ditch her, u just got used' and everything but please don't. 

I still want this relationship (or friendship) and I treasure her as a person. I like her a lot. and there's the possibility that she's just going through something. I just don't want to assume that this is over cause it might not be. 

Right now, I don't know how to continue this 'relationship'. It's hard to continue when the other person is making it feel 'one-way' even tho it used not be. And it's hard to let her know how I feel or ask her directly since we are not exactly boyfriend girlfriend. I just hope that this is a misunderstanding and it'll all work out eventually. What should I do? How do I get things to be like the way it used to. How should I treat her or go about this tactfully? Even just as friends?

114,"#74749:  

TLDR: Try to fix first but please leave if it doesn't work out.

I agree that the past generation tend to stay in relationships longer and the rate of divorce these days is definitely higher in comparison. But keep in mind that people might stay in relationships for different reasons back then. For eg, I've a few uncles who are substance abusers (alcohol, smoking, you name it) and honestly the wives are only staying because they are housewives and will lose all they have if they leave. So yes couples stay with each other longer but are they really happy? This is probably a question that only they can answer. 

What's the point of writing this? The point is that I'm seeing way too many instances whereby couples stay in relationships because of fb/ig posts about how you should ""never stop trying"" and ""stick through it all because your partner is worth more than that"". Broken relationships end up dragging for months and even years before the eventual break and by then both parties are worn out and there's no longer any affection left - only resentment. So then when outsiders lament that ""it's a pity that such a long-term relationship ended just like that"" the fact is that it has ended a long time ago. Of course there are those who on the other hand give up too easily but we need to realise that both groups are equally problematic.  

Like you said, we are all work in progress and sometimes we really are oblivious to the pain that we are causing to our partners. To this, I raise having better communication and healthy arguments instead of the focus on fixing. The obsession with fixing hints that everything can indeed be mended which is untrue because sometimes, you really can't fix what's already broken.

But in the past, what our parents or grandparents learnt is how to fix it, rather than just throw it away and 'buy' a new relationship. If you have been approaching it wrong, it shouldn't be 'you don't deserve him or her', but 'let's work and see how you can change'. We are all work in progress, and the same goes for our partners. We should always try to fix it first, before discarding our relationships.

123,"TLDR: should I be accepting a persistent guy whose looks I'm not attracted to, but his care and concern is what touched me? but important thing to bear in mind is that I have rejected him before. but he somehow touched me overtime, and he kept persisting.

Here's a super long story (I warned, I posted TLDR right at the start). Just a little background story. I'm a girl, evergreen, never been in a r/s, and this story consist of two guys. And all these interaction with them are of online context. Before you groan and do the ""omg get out there"" stuff, I do get out there, but like most other stories had recurred, it's not as easy as you think. It's hard for us working adults, and I'm shy on top of being an introvert as well.

Guy A is someone I know through an online game. He's smart, witty, and charismatic. You must be wondering how I conclude that. Former two being his replies to others, even when people try to put him down his response are always calm and above them, with a tinge of sarcasm that immediately put the hostile opponent down. Charismatic, he's a leader in our game and people look up to him. One thing about him though, because he has so much to handle, he typically showed no interest to most people.

I liked A but here's the bomb, A is married. So I have never expressed anything out of the slightest. I invested alot, though. I can drop my schedules if he need me; Even if I'm tired I made myself do it cos he need it; I send him bday packages (overseas yea) for two years now. Oversea gifts are expensive due to postage/shipping but I do it anyway. Love is blind, or so I thought it was. I can't even exactly pinpoint why I liked him. I guess I liked someone who is kinda ""cold"". Makes me have the protective instinct and feel that everyone have a good in them that will show when showed warmth.

I started a new game with A and that's where we know B from. B is pretty high flier in it, everyone is in awe of him. B knew me through A, and had joked asking if I wanted to join his ""harem"", I said no flat out since I still like A. However, from then, B made it a mission to win me over. He had told me after that he had never been rejected before and it stings, he want to revenge by making fall for him. Despite our whole guild including him know I tend towards A because I always showed I like A in banters and all. So I had never treated B serious, cos I dislike being played and I felt he wasn't serious about, it was just an ""achievement"" thing for him.

I subsequently rejected him a few more times when he asked (staggered of course, not at once). Oh, and this game has marriage, whenever he ask me I reject, he marry one, but they never last long lol. Because he marry them in name but was never with them, he's always hanging around me. The funny thing is, this ""mission"" of his never cease even after more than 6 months. And eventually he confessed that he like me and maybe beyond. And it happened only after awhile, since initially it wasn't so. 

Something I failed to mention, is that A personality got more and more worse overtime. I mean, I knew he was this way, but since I liked him I always made excuse for his behaviour and allow him to degrade me. But the existence of B made me realize how badly I was treated (and I had continue to allow it after all this while). B was always there for me, interested to know my thoughts, my feelings (and that's what matters to me), and never degrades me the way A does. A is what you call a typical narcissist. When he was in fault he will twist it to my fault, it's never his fault. I usually just say sorry and accept it. He never says sorry. 

B often ask why I allow A to be such a d!ck to myself. Because it's apparent in the way A talk to me, and I often laugh it off or bicker back, which everyone see it as playful banter. Sometimes it is, but really, I felt terribly sad sometimes. I began to talk more to B rather than A, and I love the way I am treated as someone important, or at least, a human being. But that's the thing, I like the way I was treated, but I wasn't attracted to his looks (I know how he looks like but he doesn't know how I look like yet). He, however, always constantly tell me he like/love me. So I was conflicted whether to bring it further. I didn't want to short-change him or anything, like whether do I really like him or it's just his care and concern that I like.

This post is too long in fact, I can go on and on about it since I kept this bottled up, my friends dk about this. Sorry for this long post. I actually deliberated for 2 weeks whether I want advice from others, and that it's too complicated to type out in details, but decide to in the end, since I would be meeting him in less than a month time for the first time, and it's pretty nerves-wrecking. I'm not sure anyone has ever been in such situation, anyone can relate? Or anyone with more past experiences/interactions, would appreciate some advice if possible :( 

TLDR: should I be accepting a persistent guy whose looks I'm not attracted to, but his care and concern is what touched me? but important thing to bear in mind is that I have rejected him before. but he somehow touched me overtime, and he kept persisting.

He does things for me like send me home, listen to my problems if I have any and makes time for me despite being very busy. He shows me what he is doing usually so I will rule out the possibility that he is cheating. Anyway he seems very emotionally distant. For example, when I am down he doesn’t pay attention unless I ask for it, if I’m sick he does not do anything other than send me a message, and he only makes time for me because I asked for it or listen to my problems only if I ask for it. So basically he only does things if I ask for it... and when he meet ups with me he is not excited for it. Every single time I talk to him about this, he will say that he is already putting in effort like send me back (which is actually because it’s on the way) but due to that I will not comment further because it is true that he sent me back. Is it normal to be emotionally distant but yet still like a person? We have been dating for around 8 months, could this be the reason?

142,"Yesterday, I dreamt of a guy that was going out with me. I was really happy, really really happy. But I woke up. I realised it was all a dream. I sat on my bed, looking back at how far I've come.

In primary school, people called me all sorts of names e.g. ahgua, guniang, sissy etc just because of my more feminine moves. I brushed all of that off because I know all their opinions were not important as I am who I am. 

As I start to mature, I started to realise I am interested in both male and female. Whenever I am walking on the streets, I would be checking people from both genders out. I would be stealing a glance at them and thinking how good would it be if I could also get a partner just like them, be in love etc. 

As I grow up in a conservative family, I am unable to voice out or to vent my frustrations at people, not even my friends. I have never told anyone about my sexual preferences. Even I, as the owner of this body, denied the fact that I am actually a bisexual. I cheated myself into believing that I am straight, and this constant suppression of desires had myself depressed and really introverted during my teenage years. However, deep down I know I am actually a bisexual. I would then cry myself into sleep, wondering why am I different from what the society perceived a male should like.  

As I enter poly, I met more people. I see people from all walks of life, be it straight, bisexual, homosexual etc. And I remember it was one fine day, on my way to school, a thought came across my mind. If I intend to keep my sexual preference as a secret forever, and if I continue to deny the fact that I am a bisexual, isn't it very pathetic as you don't even recognise and acknowledge yourself for who you really are? Because if you don't even accept for who you are, how are you expecting other people to accept who you are too should you tell them about your sexual preferences in the future? From then on, I start to accept myself for who I am and I am happier and contented with life since.

Although I still don't have a partner as of now to adore me, at least I appreciate who I am, and I love myself more as compared to the past. 

I just wanted to share my story. I hope to let everyone knows that there is this group of people in LGBT society who are still suffering internally. Not because of how you think of them, but how they think of themselves. Just because society sets the standards and all of us believes in it, this group of people just follow blindly and thought the standards was ""right"", thinking that the outliers (like them) were ""wrong"". Truth is, society isn't always right. Only if we could all think deeper, be a little compassionate and stand from a different viewpoint. Maybe, just maybe, the world would be a nicer place.

Thus far, our convo is centred mostly on our daily lives and some random stuff, which is ok. But recently, I realized that the convo is focusing more on me only (as in he would ask me about stuff and I would answer, and this goes on and on).

He admitted that he is an introvert and a very slow texter (takes many hours to reply) - which I'm completely fine with and I choose to believe his words.

But I'm just wondering if he is at least a little interested in me (hence he still keeps the convo going even with the not-so-active/delayed responses), or am I like just a side option to him (maybe as a chat buddy)? Thus far, I have a relatively positive impression of him, and it seems like he is quite honest and upright (general impression I get through texts). Do you guys see a future in this relationship? Or is it still too early to tell? If yes, what should I do to continue this? If not, then maybe I should just stop the conversation once and for all.

I've always had a general impression that ppl on dating sites show their preferences quite quickly (like they will stop the convo if they are not interested), but this is something different so I'm unsure what to do.

150,"I will be going to Melbourne for exchange next sem and I’m already regretting it as I know I won’t enjoy it. 

So I met this person T during one of the exchange briefings and we agreed to rent a house in Melbourne together. He wanted this expensive apartment with 1 big (1 double bed) and 1 small bedroom (1 single bed). I was a bit reluctant but agreed anyway. At first we agreed to split the money equally without deciding who stays in which room. However at the back of my head I was thinking about the difference in bedroom sizes as there’s a huge difference. 

So I decided to discuss with him about who stays in which room. He wanted the big bedroom but I told him we are paying the same amount and the one staying in the bigger room should pay more. He said that I’m calculative and taking advantage of him. Then I asked if he would be ok if I got the bigger room instead and paying the same amount. He begun to scold me about how he didn’t want to stay with me, I should be grateful to him, how we already agreed to pay the same amount etc (but not who stays in which room). 

In the end we settled for 52:48 with both of us being unhappy. So I have a feeling I will have a bad time during exchange staying with this psycho...

151,"To OP #74590, I can totally understand how you feel. In my situation, is not exactly the same as yours. 
I, however, broke up with my partner of 3 years over several months ago. I understand that I initiated it, and I dated a few people afterwards. I've met people who used me, played me, and being overly desperate beings (too nice to me),  yet still feel like I couldn't find anyone better than my ex. But I didn't wanna patch back because I felt like we were toxic and I became the worst version of me. 

We both had quite a bad temper and low tolerance in general. Whenever one flared, we would ended up quarreling. I don't see myself growing to be a better person in terms of patience. And I really want a patient person who will not flare up over minor things, and will influence me to be more patient as well.  

However, it made me more wary of love, such that I would want to be more understanding towards my next partner, address whatever issues we have as a mature adult, and help each other grow into the best version of ourselves.

Instead of cutting him out, I just felt like doing the same back to him. I know it's awful and unhealthy to live this way, but is it normal to feel so angry getting played? I know it probably won't hurt him if I do back the same but I just want him to feel played at some point too.

167,"For all the CS freshmen wondering if they should go for CS2040S, here's my 2 cents: You should take CS2040S and CS2030. If you think your workload is too high, delay CS2100 first then take in next sem under Prof Uncle Soo (an amazing lecturer). 
CS2105 now requires CS2040S, so your situation is different from your seniors. For your seniors, they could take CS2040S, CS2105, CS2106 (<- these are core mods btw), and other non-core modules like CS2107 in Y2S1, so delaying CS2040S doesn't really hurt progression of CS modules.  Now, you guys have one less module to take in Y2S1 so I wouldn't delay CS2040S if I were you, cos you'll need CS2040S for CS2103T too.
Btw, CS2030 and CS2040S are both in Java. So your workload is technically lessened by taking both mods together (profit).
Some of your seniors delayed CS2040S because Prof Harold (another awesome lecturer) teaches more topics and teaches them really well in Sem 1. This year though, the Profs are equally fantastic for CS2040S in Sem 2, so I'd simply take CS2040S without a second thought. I think most of your seniors would agree. 
Anyway, this is just some info to help u make your judgement, seniors pls add in if I missed out anything

186,"Long post ahead. Just needed to rant and seek some advice.
I have this girlfriend clique from long ago. We’ve been together for more than a decade already.  I sincerely missed those days when all of us were still single ladies, where we would often arrange meetups for dinner and would treasure each others company. 

Now the problem comes when over the years, with each girlfriend finally finding a partner, I realised that all their attitude started to change. Now, don’t get me wrong, I am not jealous or anything, in fact I am truly happy for my friends who finally found a soulmate. From the bottom of my heart. Really. But what truly irks me is that the ones who are attached starts to slowly drift away from the clique, and often doing things that neglect the feelings of their girlfriends. Eg the clique has forever been planning to go for a short trip; to batam lets say, cos we havent had a chance to do so since we’ve been together. Then this one girlfriend can say “huh no $”, only to fly off to Japan with her boyfriend couple of months later. 

Then, there’s this other girlfriend. Before any of us dated, the clique has never emphasized so much on budget whenever we meet for dinner and to celebrate each others birthday. We just eat whatever we wanted to, cos what’s most important were the company we had back then. Now, whenever we do plan a dinner date/mini birthday celebration, people be like “budget please”.  Whats worse, when you see their insta story and they be like dining like queens with their boyfriends every other day (or sometimes every day). When its the clique’s turn to meet up once every 2/3 months, it becomes a budgeted affair. So now what, your decade long girlfriends become your budgeted friends already lah. Can eat good food with boyfriend all the time, but girlfriends not worth the time and penny to eat good food with?? Plus, we always plan a month or two ahead the birthday or dinner date, and people always gives excuses of being busy and all, it’s so darn hard to fix a date that everyone can make it. 

And then, every night (i swear) after work she’s having dinner with  her boyfriend  -.-  as seen from her insta story. THIS i cannot understand. 

To fellow girls, is this common in girl cliques or is it just mine. Why the need for double-standard, is it that difficult to prioritize both clique and boyfriend without upsetting either parties? Or is it that a decade long friendship means nothing to them anymore once they had a partner. Ain’t it like like burning bridges with friends who truly stood by their side since the beginning, long before that boyfriend of theirs existed??? To that, I always feel very sad and disappointed with these girlfriends. Is it right for me to go tell them out about their behaviour??

205,"Is it normal that the two guys are having sexual tension between each other? I have a friend whom I noticed glancing at me and keep sending me lovely messages but he does have girlfriend which is happened to be my friend too. Whenever we went to study together, I noticed that he keep glancing at me and started to bring his body closer to me, then I would asked him why he keep doing that. He would just shake his head and continue back study. But I noticed that he will start to sweat after that even though the library is cold. Does he like me or what? I am so confused and if this thing happens in long term run, I might ended up having sex with him. Or maybe bust his nuts...

206,"I met this girl J during a volunteering experience in May this year, and we've been going out and messaging daily since then, even after the event ended. She isn't the most bedazzling or cutest girl out there, but one of the most even-tempered, sweetest and most rational girl I've ever met. We've been out on quite a number of dates and try to meet up about once every week or so. However, we've never kissed nor hugged nor even held hands or ""made it official"" with our friends and families, and I feel like the relationship/ this dating phase is getting a bit stagnant... I don't know how to take it to the next level and I don't want to rush things, but 7 months feels a bit long (doesn't it?), especially since most people I know already go to 'third base' within the first 3 dates. I've asked her this before but she always give a very non-committal answer and seems rather uncomfortable. I'm not sure if I'm the problem or she is waiting or just not ready? Not just physically or sexually, but emotionally and spiritually as well. Thoughts? We aren't exactly young either (24/26) so if this doesn't work out I don't want to hold her back... I've never felt this way with any other girls before and J is really really special to me, but I'm feeling a bit stuck at this point to be honest.

207,"I went on an exchange and i met this overseas housemate who I get along really well. She is like a close sis to me but i slowly realised I am developing feelings for her. Knowing her results is not good, I feel like helping her. Knowing she have not eaten I will feel like getting/making food for her. 

There are times she make me feel really happy and times she upset me a lot, not sure why but I get jealous easily especially when she share her boy problems or get close to other dudes. We are like super close friends and we are honest and open about everything to each other~ of course except telling her I like her.

Honestly, i feel like confessing to her my feelings but the only issue here is I am a girl too. However, i do not usually feel this way with other girls so i am not sure is it just a one off thing with her because we are so close... 

There are many times she will joke and say if we dont get married by what age we will get married... or like comment saying if she is a dude she will chase after me.. I am not sure is she joking or dropping hints.. With that being said, she is crazy over this dude too which she keep sharing about him to me..  so I am guessing she is straight...?

Recently, I am starting to develop sexual feelings for her which i feel is so real but so unreal at the same time.

I will be heading back to sg soon and will not get to see her anymore, not sure what i should do.. any advice?

My dad was close to being a multi-millionaire only 2 years back until fate threw itself at him and his organization got acquired in a ruthless takeover. Needless to say, nearly everyone got laid off and him, being noble in his ways, was left last man standing in sg offices and revolted against his staff being laid off. As a result, he lost his job and decided to start his own venture. It has been almost 2 years since and he's gone ALL IN into his business, selling the properties, assets and whatnot. We were close to selling the fucking car this year. Why he lost all the money and hasn't made any back is a whole different fuckery for a diff time. (Pisses me off) There are leads into investments from VCs etc but as of this moment, nothing is confirmed.
It's a very tough time for my family since obv we all depend on it. And when it comes to me, I'm still doing my bachelors and doing part-time gigs to make my walkaround money and it fucking enrages me to my bones that I'm unable to do much for his business financially. (He needs major funding obv). I help him out in my own little ways as much as I can (its a tech startup) and I have even offered to pitch to VCs for him but he's the kinda dad who trusts all over his own kin. (Mixing business & family is always a bad idea). We're gonna go bust soon if we do not get funded soon and all of this is fucking with my head. I'm always angry & aggressive, taking it out on other ppl and I'm worried I'll lose my shit soon.
I have tried just being into my own shit and letting him handle his business, but he's a noble man and a bad businessman. He's too nice and people including his employeed take advantage of him.

Today I witnessed it first hand. NUS chinese male business student here doing internship at a tech company. My Senior manager needed my help today, he said he wanted to send some food. Anyway it’s friday and most of our colleagues are on leave anyway since it’s the festive season

So we ended up at a restaurant where we took packet food for like 300 pax and here i thought it was for a company lunch or something. We ended up at a mosque where he dropped 100 and then he went to another mosque for another 100 before ending up at an orphanage for the remaining food. He says anyone at the mosque can have it for their lunch. And then my Senior manager had lunch with me and got me a grab back to office before him going for Friday prayers himself! So he got back and we had a little chat, and he actually shared that he’s where he never imagined he would be at. He said he never imagined he would have a 5 digit salary and he says that, even before when he Just started working with a 3K starting salary, he tries to give part of his money for the poor or for a good cause because he had nothing to begin with. Hardship in the past kinda story.

 In Uni he used to give free tuition and volunteered every summer break to paint poor people’s house at poor estate. And he said that nobody becomes poorer from giving. Wow I’m seriously amazed, and i’m pretty sure there are many people like these out there! Seriously it made me think bout all the time i want another NMDs or Ultraboost when i already have enough and there are people out there who’s this nice. I’m starting to look at things really differently now.

At 2pm he suggested catching a movie, but when we checked out GV, there was nothing we fancied. Then he suggested that we Netflix at his place (a few bus stops away from the mall we were at).
We watched 2 movies from 3-7pm, then abit nua so we ordered Grabfood. After dinner, we caught another show from 8-10pm. Throughout the 3 movies, we were together under the blanket on his single bed. It was cozy and it did not feel awkward, felt super comfy to be very honest. At 10++ we had enough of movies and proceeded to lie down and cuddle. 
Things got heated and we went to 3rd base really quickly after making out. However after around 1hr(?) for some reason he was clearly very hesitant and said something like this ""I have been hard for very long and I really want to do it with you. But I think it is better to wait till we are together, not now when things are still ambiguous. Idw to take advantage of you."" 
Woah I was quite taken aback. Though it was indeed anti-climax, and a little traditional, but I guess it shows that he is someone with self-control and serious about this? Not sure... any thoughts guys?

230,"In addition to the “target CAP” method when using SU options, which is what I use, I would also like to add that the popular belief that SU makes your base weaker is building on the “Scarcity Mindset“. It’s stressful and unnecessary.

In reality, a grade below your target honours class will pull your CAP down as much as an equivalent grade above the target class pulling your CAP up, regardless whether you use SU or not. For example, if you aim for Second Upper (4.0), getting a B is going to pull you down as much as a A- is going to pull you up, regardless of your base. Do the math if you don’t believe me.

In any given sem, it’s not like you are only taking one module whereby one bad grade is totally irreversible, most likely you have other mods to balance it out and you still can achieve your target. Live with the Abundance Mindset and be happy.

Sometimes, I attempt to catch my fart when it comes out, and hold that space of air and quickly place it near his nose so that he gets the full smelly impact.

I guess, we are two lucky souls who managed to find each other on the same weird wavelength. I can see how to other people, they would find our behaviour awfully weird though.

I went to the Dean's office the next day to speak to the vice dean and she said they considered all such cases if they can pull up any module grade before releasing the final grade. She told me if I needed the second upper for future masters, they are happy to write a letter of recommendation. I left disappointed. Subsequently I managed to get into banking and it was a tough time as it was aftermath of Lehman.

The only impact the second lower had on my first job was $200 lower on my starting salary. I managed to jump to other bigger banks and got promoted a few times. I am in a higher position than my peers who scored better than me in school. Banking is cut throat industry where one has to work smart and grades doesn't matter anymore. it's performance but I have to say SMU graduates are more vocal and NUS grad are more competent technically which is our disadvantage as in the corporate world, if you can speak better, management will take notice of you more.

To determine what to SU, Look at your CAP
5.0 - 4.25: B+ and below
4.24 - 3.75: B and below
3.74 - 3.25: B- and below
3.24 - 2.75: C+ and below
2.74 - 2.5: D and below. Though if you think that you wouldn't get more than 2 C+ for mods that can be SU-ed next sem, then SU C+ as well.
This is just my opinion though and there's more consideration to be made, such as your desired honors, deviation of grades or how well you will do next sem. However, if you don't want to think too much into it, then I feel that this is a pretty good guide to go with.

What determines increment or promotion is ability to resolve and alleviate issues at work at shortest possible time. I have seen people with 10 years and above or less than 3 years leaving their respective firms as they were done with learning or had enough experience to have a more challenging career. But the key is the jump must be to a ideal firm that can provide platform to perform, which then leads to higher salary and better remuneration package.

I'm in the exact spot as you, except that I'm a male. Dating apps aren't the right place (girls just want to meet me for flings, when I'm looking for something serious).

There's kind of no way to help, friends and even those online will just tell you to wait for the right one to come. But will they ever come?

I would say, just expand your social circle, I've been trying my best to do that, and started to know more people of the opposite gender. You'll start to know what to look for soon. I found that I prefer girls who are more mature and know what they want to do with life (unfortunately, most of these girls are attached).

1) If you score A+, A, or A-, please don't S/U that module. You'll need those grades to pull up your CAP.
2) If you score F, please just S/U (U) that module. You will have to retake the module or substitute with another module in another semester regardless and letting the F grade stand will affect your CAP. Drastically.
3) If you score C+ or C, you should S/U (S) that module. Those are probably the worst passing grades you are going to get.

4) If you score D+ or D, Take note that if you do S/U (U) that module, you will need to overload another semester to retake that module (or substitute with another module). The good thing is that this U grade will not affect your CAP now. However, if you decide to keep the grade, then you will not need to overload for this module but it will affect your CAP (D+ and D give 1.5 and 1.0 respectively). So it is really your choice here of whether to rid a bad grade and overload later, or really push urself harder for the other modules. 

5) Finally, if you score B+, B, B-, aha this is really difficult, and there is no one-size-fits-all answer. It really depends on what is your target CAP at the end of your 4 years. For example, if you intend to get 2nd Lower (3.50 - 3.99), then you should keep the B+ (4.0) and S/U (S) the B- (3.0). Surprisingly, it makes no difference to the Honours Class whether you keep or S/U (S) the B (3.5). This gives you a ""safety net"" to play with. If you intend to get 2nd Lower but are scared to drop to 3rd Class (3.20 - 3.49), then keep the B. If you think you have some chance to push to 2nd Upper (4.00 - 4.49), then S/U (S) the B.

6) One more thing! Contrary to popular belief, your overall CAP is weighted per module (or MCs to be more precise), not per semester. If you get 5.00 this sem (by S/U-ing all except your only A) and 4.00 next sem (e.g. getting B+ for every module), your overall CAP after 2 semesters is NOT 4.50 but will be lesser (probably 4.17). This shows that the CAP is calculated based on the modules, not based on the semester. So don't think you'll have a free ride by S/U-ing everything except your only A, because you will suffer in the later semesters.

tl;dr: S/U all C's and F's. Keep all A's. As for B's, ask yourself what CAP you want to achieve. If u aiming for 1st class, SU all B+ and below. If aiming for 2nd upper, SU all B and below, keep ur B+
In case anyone finds this useful ????

Another question is abt the special term. Are modules in special term SU by default or still need to make a decision whether to SU or not? (like some GE courses?)

256,"To #74228 and students  wondering if it’ll get better, it will. Just wanted to share my story:

I’m a Yr4 Accounting senior and my first sem in biz was dismal. 2B+and 2C+, by calculation it’s a third class. Spent the next few days in shock.

The subsequent compulsory accounting mods against very smart, driven students (most of which have been in elite schools their whole lives) saw about the same results. These peeps scored at least 5-6 distinctions in A levels at that time so the competition was really tough.

Managed to pull to a second lower by end of Y2 but always felt inadequate- never knew anyone below Cap4 (either that or some people were lying) but gradually as I cleared my compulsory mods and explored modules outside my faculty and more towards my interest like languages and philo, I found myself putting much less effort for much better grades. Consistently got 2-3As which pulled my Y3S2 Cap to a 3.9.

With FYP this sem was just nice CAP4.0. When I received my SMS (usually I can’t sleep the day before) I literally cried

Basically, it’s entirely possible for someone to jump 2 classes with the right determination, right module choices with just the right friends and company to push you to succeed. 

Don’t fret about your results, you can definitely improve, merry Christmas everyone!

An internship in a company with a tech team would enable me to gain real-world working experience like enterprise-grade code and infrastructure. I have browsed through jobs/internships on online platforms like LinkedIn, AngelList, Internsg.

259,"As a fresh graduate (I ended school this semester), I received my SMS result with apathy yesterday. My CAP was firmly in first-class range since the previous semester, and taking fewer modules this semester means that only in stress-cases (multiple Bs and below) could my honors class drop. 

For context, I secured my job in September, having interviewed in August, and since then school for me has just been running through the motions. I never put in a shift in project work nor did I fight for class participation as I have done previously, never bothered or interested in my modules - after all, they were unrelated to my job. 

As expected, the results confirmed my honours class. I felt a distinct sense of emptiness. What have I been fighting for all these time. Jobs? Nah, most employers only need minimum second class uppers. To the juniors worrying about their CAP in your junior years, my advice is to chill out and immerse your self in personal growth, learning and employment experiences that are relevant to you because these are what employers will query in the interview. 

Yes, it is possible to increase your CAP, and it is normal to start off poorly, given the noise you face as a freshman in the first year and you are still finding direction and footing in school. I pulled up my CAP from a floor of 4.17 in my first semester to secure first class, but it does require some commitment and tenacity

I have been applying for summer internship 2020, and recently received an interview request for 1 out of maybe 10 companies I have applied to after a month.

I actually passed the interview and was offered an internship role with them.

Problem is, it is a small company, and the internship description was minimal. I am not sure if I will be able to learn and benefit from the internship after accepting it. And no other companies have gotten back to me except them.

My CAP is the lower range of 4, and I have only Orbital to show myself off. I am not sure if I should just accept this internship, or reject it and try and apply for other internship that might be more competitive and have more applicants, which gives me less chance to get into them given my mediocre results and experiences :( Side note, this will be my first internship.

Also, anything to look out for when applying for Computing Internships in general?

I was with my ex boyfriend for 1.5 years and I loved him very much. I put in all my effort, treated him very well and yet he talked to another girl pretty flirtatiously (in my opinion). I wouldn’t consider it cheating now that I have reflected on our relationship. But he didn’t respect me/my boundaries when I pointed out that I was uncomfortable with him talking to this particular girl. He continued talking to her after we broke up and subsequently asked her out.

I don’t want to pin the blame on him, I too have my weak points. What’s done is done and I have to keep moving forward no matter how hard it is. 

Maybe he just wasn’t ready to be in a relationship. I’ve come to realise that you will never be good enough for a man who isn’t ready to commit. And that’s fine, everyone is on their own journey. I hope one day I’ll meet someone who’d put in the same effort as I do, but until then I’ll work on bettering myself for the right man.

sorry to disappoint any readers but no we didn't do anything, but ever since that day which was around a week ago, I keep thinking about her even though I've been trying to block it out. 

I can't tell if this counts as cheating and if its because because I am very inexperienced with girls and fell into infatuation easily but I've been feeling really guilty to my girlfriend and trying to spend more time with her since its the holidays now as well. 

I've always despised cheaters but now i'm really afraid i am emotionally cheating, although I haven't texted the other girl since then. Does this count as emotional cheating? What do you guys advice I do?

Even though he denies it, I realised that he doesn’t make any effort to meet me properly. Whenever he asked to meet me, it’s either work related or a place to chill. I actually gave up on this date already. 
However, recently I think he invited me to a family event the next day while he was kinda drunk? Wasn’t sure if he was drunk as he was still capable of walking and eating but he sounded drunk when he called me. 
I didn’t really believed his sincerity in the invitation as that was so unlike of him.
Next day, he kinda airplane-d me. When asked him about the event, he just ignored me and told me he reached his family event late etc. 

Anyone ever gotten this kind of shit from guys before? I feel like most of the guys I met are jerks lmao.

303,"I need some advice here. Basically two to three weeks back, while I was browsing some listings on taobao on my boyfriend’s phone, I came across his wechat conversations by chance. I chanced upon conversations, obscene pictures and interactions with multiple girls. Basically he cheated. So he begged for my forgiveness after finding out that I knew, and asked me for another chance. I forgave him very easily to be honest, I thought that he would change. Fast forward to today, I know it’s wrong to check his phone but I just wanted to find out if he has actually changed, so I did. To my horror, he was messaging different girls on Instagram flirting and asking them for their telegram handles. So I checked his telegram too, and apparently he archived many conversations with different girls, muting them so that I’d never find out. Their conversations were so flirty, definitely not between two normal friends. My boyfriend and I went to watch Star Wars with my family last Saturday. And he claimed to the girls that he watched alone? Why is he trying to hide? Furthermore, he complained about me to them, without letting them know the context that he actually cheated on me. Now I’m like the bad guy. What should I do now? He don’t know I’ve checked his phone, though it was wrong, but it’s probably a blessing in disguise. Things will never change huh?

313,"I'm not sure if I should break up with my boyfriend of 7 years. We were together since we were in Secondary 3. You would just look at me and smile at me in class!!! Urghhhh. Sometimes, we would even eat lunch together, or hang out and chill at Lot 1 after school. Even though we were in different CCAs, we still managed to spend time with each other. We hid our relationship from our parents cause we knew they were against our relationship. Only our schoolmates and probably teachers knew about us and everyone thought that we were so cute together. They even thought that our relationship would last.

Then came JC. Both of us agreed to enter the same JC and went on to SAJC together. We took different combinations and only had same lecture and tutorials for Maths, Chemistry and Physics.  Still remember the time you bought me an exam welfare pack before A levels to wish me all the best! That's super cute and I super adore you. We had more arguments than usual especially in JC, but I don't blame you since both of us are feeling the pressure to do well in JC and go to a good school together in NUS. Eventually we managed to get through it and graduate from SAJC together. 

You got a higher score than me for A levels and you went to Business and Accountancy while I settled for Mechanical engineering. Due to the difference in courses, we spent less time together as our timetables clashed and it's not feasible to just walk to each other's school just to meet up for lunch. You usually spend your time with your clique instead of meeting me to go home together. How I wish both of us were staying on campus so that we can meet up more often. It's like things changed ever since we entered university. You claimed that you were busy on weekends trying to finish up your tutorials and understanding the lecture but half the time your Instagram stories show that you are outside with your clique! Because of this we started arguing and we started to talk less. 

We haven't talked for about a week and I'm not sure what to do. Should I message him first and talk to him and clear the doubts, and try to be understanding towards him? I mean it's the holidays, we all know that there is no work to do during the holidays but he hasn't been talking to me much ever since the end of the examinations.

But anyway, it's the end of Year 1 Sem 1 for both of us. Results are coming out real soon and I hope that you read this message and score really well, as it's your dream to get a GPA of at least 4.5!!

Hope things will go back to the things they were, especially the times when we were in NS where we usually meet up on the weekends to talk and chill :)

For MA1511 I scored full marks for the assignments and attendance portion (35%) for finals (65%) I could only confidently do one question, the rest were just drips and drabs of workings with no solutions. 

For MA1512, which I am most nervous about, the quiz (20%) which I did and compared with my friends answers so hopefully fingers crossed I can at least pass. Finals (80%) was a bloodbath. There was no one question I could say that I did confidently, half of my attempts ended in me not being able to continue on, the other half ended up with weird answers that even I myself could not believe would be true but it was the best that I could do. I did do the past year papers but this years paper to me was a whole new level of not even knowing what formula or method to even start with. 

In addition, I'd like to ask for some advice on whether I should SU and remod if I get a D grade for core mods.

He just like to let everyone breath in his smoke. I wonder if he's just extremely selfish or he's a sadist who wants everyone to suffer with him? The fact that my brother and I have childhood asthma didn't even budge him in stopping smoking in front of us. 
 
The worst part is that he's smoking contraband cigarettes which smells like poison. Life at home became hell ever since he started smoking contraband cigarettes from his room, with his windows closed, door opened, with his fan blowing the smoke out into the whole house. That time, I didn't have a room of my own and literally felt like dying whenever he snaps the lighter. During my A level year, it's just so depressing that after a hectic day, what welcomes you back home is the smell of smoke. Hence I dreaded going home and tried to stay in school until late night. 

He started smoking that trash since around 2015 and I wonder why the smuggler still hasn't been caught, even though I keep seeing news of contraband cigarettes being found at immigration customs. I actually tried filing a report in the SG customs app as a man used to come to our house regularly to sell those cigarettes wrapped in newspaper to my dad. However, I think my efforts were futile...

Now, I have my own room and can avoid the smoke more but the whole house is still smelly because of him, so I'm looking forward to moving out into my own house. Nonetheless, I'm still worried about my family's health since we are living in an environment like Indonesia with the forest fire... My mum and I wear a mask at home but my stubborn younger brother doesn't...

She suspects that I am in a relationship with another girl when in reality there is none going on or gets frustrated with me for some random reason that she comes up with. Few weeks ago we were hanging out in town and I was on my phone, she suddenly decides to pull the phone out of my hand and throw it directly at my face(which hit my jaw quite hard by the way). When I questioned her about it she just walked away without saying anything. She is reluctant to have a conversation with me and have even let her search through my phone to let her see that I am not cheating on her. However she still does not seem convinced. She has also been giving me random slaps and punches for no reason while I am over at her place(she does not live with her family), and I have stopped meeting her in private areas because of this for the past few months. But she seems to be doing this in public spaces as well in a less obvious manner. It never used to be like this during the first year of our dating and getting to know each other in uni. It was a really memorable and great time that we shared in the past. We have both graduated and are in pretty decent jobs with some financial stability. Is this some sort of mental illness that this sociopath can get help for or should I just break this damn nightmare of a relationship this is turning into? But I am also afraid to break this relationship off at this point because our social circle of friends have become very intertwined...basically my friends are also her friends vice versa... and she we also go to the same church almost every week which makes things even worst. Our friends have no clue what is going on and they assume that we are a happy couple. How do I break this off without damaging my current social circle of friends? Has any guy encountered similar situations like this before? Your insight can be really helpful...Mental illness is a serious problem these days ...

320,"How do I deal with feeling that I'm never good enough?

I've always have this feeling that I'm underperforming, not good enough etc, even if the facts/my peers are telling me otherwise.

My peers are always telling me 
""Take a break, you've worked hard enough today.""
""You don't have to work constantly.""
""Rest, no need to be so stressed.""

But I just can't sit still when there's incomplete stuff to be done. I used to panic a lot before I submit my assignments, always paranoid that I might have made a huge mistake somewhere. 

It's not that I don't get validation for my work. I never scored less than a B+ for my tests and assignments. I have consistently maintained a 4.2-ish CAP for the past 4 years. During my internships, my coworkers and superiors have praised my work. But the thing is that I have somehow unintentionally conditioned myself to tune out these compliments/positive feedback. No matter how many times I receive the validation, it never ""calms"" me. I always feel like I'm not performing up to standards/expectations. I always feel like I'm below average. I can never list down my strengths and achievements easily, but have not problem listing down entire pages of my weaknesses and past mistakes. 

Right now, I have graduated. While attending a job interview a couple of weeks ago, the interviewers asked me to elaborate on my strengths, and I got totally stumped. Did manage to cook up something eventually, but I don't remember what I said, only that it wasn't completely coherent. To my surprise, I actually got the offer. Now that I'm 2 weeks into my first job, the paranoia is really driving me nuts. I am constantly worried about underperforming, and is seriously questioning why I got hired in the first place.  Even though it's not showing yet, I feel that it'll affect my performance in the long run.

This thing is hurting my interpersonal and romantic relationships as well. I was really close to this girl about a year back, and I'm very certain there's mutual attraction, and she's only waiting for me to pop the question/take action. However, at some point I started questioning what she saw in me, and feeling I'm not good enough for her. I started avoiding her even though she showed consistent concern and affection. Eventually I ghosted her and y'all can guess the rest.

How should I manage this paranoia? How do I effectively tell myself: ""Chill the fk out, you're doing fine.""? It's really driving me insane.

Although this article is old, the threat of scammers and hackers seeking your phone number for whatever purposes they have is still real. Just recently, a friend of mine got hacked on facebook. Apparently, another facebook friend of his who was already hacked, asked for his phone number for some 'Lazada gift cards competition' and he was subsequently hacked. 

The hacked account then goes on asking other facebook friends via messenger for their phone numbers for 'Lazada gift cards competition' etc, possibly in an attempt to hijack more accounts or perform other actions. The hacker also changed the email and log in info of the hacked person to give the person a harder time to recover the account.

Do contact your friends through other platforms to verify it is them before giving the (possibly) hackers your phone number! 

Meanwhile, if you get hacked, do remember to check your bank account too to ensure that no fraudulent charges has been made to your account!

We went out on a few dates and he was all over me, being very sweet and wholesome and just caring about everything I did and liked outside of class. We met at a small meetup where local and intl students got together over activities and stuff. He was respectful, and really made me feel like I was some sort of 'soulmate' he couldn't do without. I thought ""wow SG guys are not bad at all. I wish we had more of people like you from where I'm from."" 

Since our r/s had some sort of 'deadline', we had sex (the only time) but I noticed that it felt so uninspired. Like he just needed me as a release and wasn't interested in really making 'love' to me. After we did it, he stopped talking to me. No mention about what will happen with the r/s--I was just kept hanging. No proper goodbyes (I left for home weeks after it happened), no texts, no nothing. It would have been fine if there weren't any feelings involved, but sadly there were on my end. I don't know about him. I felt used and tricked. It made me wonder if that's all he wanted from me, maybe another girl to add on his list. The least I wanted was to be confronted about it.

I've been told I look quite good so over the years I hooked up with a few pretty girls and we've been friends with benefits, meeting up every week or so. They are always so eager to show affection and to be honest I find them a little too clingy. I always treat them very well and since my family is pretty well-off, I pay for most of our outings and even the hotels when we didn't have any place.

Anyway, I try to show them that we are just casual friends (when they ask me about serious topics like what we are, I reply saying that we are still young and should discuss this in the future). But now, most of them are graduating and I feel like they are pressuring me to marry or propose to them. Two of them even asked me to meet their family during the next Chinese New Year and there's a real crazy one. Initially she started stalking me, but recently she even claimed that she's pregnant and wants me to go to the doctor with her. Obviously I ignored and blocked her number.

I'm genuinely perplexed, I understand that Chinese girls are more traditional in ""that"" aspect, but what are they even expecting from me?? To me it's just about mutual enjoyment, having a good time but apparently they don't feel the same way. I guess you can't even treat a girl nice without them catching some sort of feelings.

341,"TLDR: How do I tell my boyfriend of two years that I don't trust him in a nice way? Our relationship has been smooth sailing so far but his overly ruthless nature makes me wonder if he will disappear the minute we run into problems. 

I think I've seen a few similarish posts here so I'm writing here for advice too. We've been together for a while, soon to be two years, but I'm starting to take him seriously now and it kind of freaks me out that I don't really trust him and I feel like I should verbalize this to him but I'm not sure how I should do it. By not trusting him, I mean, I feel that he would be the kind of person who would abandon the family in time of need (e.g I get cancer! Our kids have ADHD! Or I lose my jobs ((I'm not working yet, still in uni but he is)). I also feel like he would be the kind of person who would leave the minute we have a major disagreement (everything has been smooth sailing so far, he's very chill and I'm very tolerant). I know it feels unfair to assume the worst of someone but how do I know that he's not going to flake out on me? We've been blessed enough to not be put through any major trials or tribulations but that does make me worry that he's not ""man enough"" to handle them when they inevitably come. 

He has this whole air of ""If you're not happy, leave."" Am I an asshole for feeling that he's not reliable at all?

A part of me feels that marrying a person like that is just asking for trouble even though he's been great in every other aspect so far - yet is asking for reassurance in this area bad? Even if I tell him this, what can he do to prove that he's going to stick around? Or what can I do to reassure myself?

Please help, I'm so stressed about this.

348,"TLDR: I broke up with my bf because he's a loner 

We've been together for a year and I know him for 2 years. In the two years, he has gone out for dinner 3x with a JC friend, once with a pri sch friend, once with a cousin. That's it. I open his WA and I'm the only one who texts him regularly apart from his parents and siblings.

As a 25 year old guy, I expect you to have some people around you. Relatives, cousins, friends, someone! I'm an introvert too but I find him extreme. He works out by himself everyday, watches football, plays FIFA. I've asked him to at least watch football at a coffeeshop so you are around people, find some football fans online so you can talk to people. He can go weeks without anyone other than me and his fam talking to him. I couldn't stand it. I broke up.

How did he manage to get a gf then? He had so much time on his hands that he was always there for me, every impromptu lunch, every text at whatever time, he replied, he showed up.

Now, I'm moving on with my life but I'm worried for him. He refuses to change himself, he says he likes stability and is working on himself. But you won't grow just by being alone. You grow by talking, sharing, giving and being surrounded by people.

I asked him, ""Have you felt happy in the recent few years?""
He replied, ""No. I feel peaceful and that's enough for me.""

Loneliness is very difficult. I'm worried for him maybe because of guilt but idk what to do for him.

349,"There is something which I would love to get off my chest and rant about, not a troll post here, I would love to get some advice comments about this. No hateful comments here please :(  Sorry for my not-so-fluent english. 

Long rant ahead.. 

Story 1:

My bf (25y) and I (19y) have been together for close to 3 years. However, something that he have done recently made me doubt our rsl. 

One day when he came home from work he was 'not being the usual him' and was talking to me 'in a very nice way' (?) I knew him for 4 years so I could tell if he was hiding from me something/ did something guilty. Immediately i felt something was wrong. I know its wrong to check his phone without asking for his permission first but i just cant hold back my curiousness anymore. 

Long story short i checked his phone when he is not around and caught him sexting another gaming girl. My heart was literally aching and I teared up when I saw the conversation. Well based on the conversation on this gaming app i saw, he asked the girl for 'pics', but the girl apparently said she was too tired. The short conversation ended just right there, but before that there were afew phone calls made between them, so this could have happen long time ago without me knowing.

This has happened before, not sexting but cheesy way of talking to other girls online. Trust me, I have confronted him countless times and we 'had that talk before'. I ended up giving myself another chance/hope to forgive him and that it would not happen again. However, i thought that this has gone too far. 

I apologised to him first for looking at his phone without his permission, then confronted him about it and he said he was not hiding it from me (he had password on his phone and i unlocked it to check). He thought it was ok to sext with me knowing? He said he is not hiding anything as he said IT IS SIMILAR TO WATCHING P**N ONLINE ?!? LIKE HOW??! He said as long he's not showing any of his pictures to the other party it does not count as sext?!?! CAN SOMEONE PLEASE ENLIGHTEN ON THIS?!? Am i right or his right on this?!? Instead of showing any remorse, he kinda said that it is normal??!? to do it ??! Obviously i was pissed off and ignore him when he tried to coaxed me the entire night. He asked me if I still want him or not and I said Idk. 

Long story short, I still forgive him the next day because he promised me that he would not do it again. Am I being too nice to forgive him?  He cried and told me he would change and he wants to marry and have a family with me next time... we have spend so much time together and I do not want to leave him as well :( On the other hand, I kinda felt that I was being guilt trip to forgive him... 

Now Im lying on the bed while typing this, doubting my whole rsl with him every night, I am trying my best to trust him but I cry in bed silently at night with him beside me whenever I remembered what happen. I spend some nights at his house with him). I have never felt so self conscious and heart-broken after it happened :( 

Story 2: 

I guess many of you experienced the after-honeymoon period phase after a relationship. I felt like my relationship with him it getting more ""awkward"" as time passes by. We have lesser/nothing to talk about in real life/in text. Trust me I have suggested to go out to try new food/activities, but idk why but it just feels sooooo awkward to me. I feel like we are just sticking together just because we have no one else? I am feeling so tired in this relationship and i felt like we just so used to each other? Sometimes when i try to make conversations with him he just seems disinterested and gives me short reply. I love texting and I used to love texting him, ever since his reply have gotten cold, i have stopped. How i wish he would text me frequently :( 

Sigh I am getting so tired in this relationship, I have though of breaking up... I think me and him would be better off as friends? (I only have a few friends, and they are really busy with school/work, this is the reason why i was reluctant to break up with him, I was afraid to be alone). 

His family loves me so much, especially his mom who treats me so well, I can't bear to leave them :( 
To note, My bf does not mistreats me in anyway, he often buys me food i love and things i like for special occasions. I do the same to him too. 

Well I guess i will end my rant here.

For some reason that I cannot recall, I know that it never snows in Singapore. Instead, you get the occasional hailstorms. Do you Singaporeans carry special umbrellas for this?

Is changi beach one of them? It appears to me from Google Maps that Changi beach is relatively closer to China that other beaches in Singapore. Roughly how far do I have to swim?

So recently I started making bunch of new friends(mainly guys due to my nature) and I started hanging up with them in terms of like just play video games and chit chat.

So after awhile My boyfriend started getting so pissed because I started spending significant less time with him and he wants me to stop spending so much time with them. okay, fair, so I tried to squeeze some time for him and instead of playing with my friends and messaging them as often. I cut down a little and started to commit more and gave him a little bit more time but when I gave him more time he just wants even more. 

I just feel really stressed. Why can’t I just play with my friends more? Why can’t he be understanding? Sometime I just feel so controlled and stressful. 

Ik it’s unfair for him that I spend more time with other guys but it’s mainly messaging and sometime video games only and because of that.. sometime he asked what am I doing. I will just lied to him and say I’m doing nothing Or YouTube just because idw him to feel jealous. Am I wrong? What am I suppose to do?

My boyfriend and I are(?) together for a little over one year. We were doing well and all but I have never been able to tell him the things that I disliked about him; especially his behaviour and the way the treats me. But recently, I kinda snapped and dropped him a huge bomb of things that I have disliked about him. He took it quite negatively(he claims that I am tired of him???) and tbh I was hoping he would take the initiative to change his behaviour(he always scold me and rely on me on the the daily basis, literally. Felt more like his maid than his gf) because I really love him alot. But he said he refused to change because that is the way he is and he like himself that way. I was hoping that I was enough for him to change.. I am his first girlfriend and there are definitely many times where I felt love and appreciation from him. I tried to be an understanding girlfriend. Maybe my expectations were too high? Oh and he misunderstood that I am getting tired of him because I said that I was tired of his behaviour and the way he treats me. And he never ever admit his own mistakes, it is always me who apologised first. Moreover, he really sometimes give others bad impression of me because of the things he say about me in front of other people. If I were to tell him about his mistake, he would retaliate and push the blame to me instead. But nonetheless, he is pretty selfish and self centered at times but he have never failed to show me love in his own ways until recently. Honestly as I type this confession, I feel like he is a pretty shitty boyfriend but everyone is not perfect. I am sure I am not a perfect girlfriend either. 

Anyhow, as I've said he took things negatively, we 'broke up'. I was a sore loser and I couldn't let him go because he is really my partner and lover. I begged and cried for one more chance. Somehow I got that chance, but recently he told me that he is unsure of his feelings for me ever since that day I took my stuffs back and walked out of the house. So we decided to take a break and I want to give him some time(since he said that he needs time to get hold of his feelings for me again). 

I don't think it was wrong of me to express my feelings but it took a negative turn in our relationship. Do you guys think there is still a chance of rekindling our bond? I really don't want to stress him but I really miss him and the way we were last time. Is there any way that I can make him feel better? I feel sad and it really hurt me when he said he is unable to tell whether he still have feelings for me.. even I can't feel the love anymore. Any advice, please? No trollers please :(

I also really like the various baos, such as Char Siew Bao, Liu Sha Bao etc. Same goes for Nasi Lemak, especially those that are wrapped in the traditional pandan leaves. I will really miss these foods when I go back to my home country Japan in two months time.

I don’t understand how your Singaporean stomachs can stomach these few things after swallowing these ingredients from each of these three meals: the shell of the prawn tail in prawn noodles, the paper stuck at the bottom of the steamed char skew baos and liu sha boas, and lastly, the pandan leaves used to wrap the nasi lemak.

To me, the prawn tail shells, paper at the bottom of the steamed baos, and pandas leaves all taste exotic to me. I respect this is your culture, and that’s why I try to go with the flow and try my best to enjoy the taste of these three things.

373,"Sorry for the incoming rant but I have a few questions regarding the online-dating landscape in singapore. For some context, I'm a male NUS student and recently I've been trying out the online-dating apps since it is the holidays. As the matches come in, I observe that singaporean girls that use these apps don't seem to be interested in dating at all. They either lead you into a never ending session of small talk or they do not even intend on meeting anyone in real life. 

In terms of chatting online, most either give uninterested vibes/short replies (even when we are matched) or are somehow blind/unresponsive to my carefully crafted/decent open ended questions (not hard questions at all). When it comes to meeting up in real life, they simply refuse to do so (when the point of dating apps is to arrange a date to not only learn about the other person in real life but to see if there is chemistry).  

While I agree that my view is bias, especially after wasting days of small talk, I feel that I am not understanding something about singaporean girls. Do singaporean girls go on dating-apps to boost their ego or are they simply just a tough nut to crack? What are the usual norms in online dating? In the mean time, the only nut I can crack is my own.

After the breakup, he spammed me with calls and texts that were filled with insults. It took me months to heal myself and get rid of his toxicity. While I have moved on and became stronger, he still texts and calls me once in awhile, which I ignored. Whenever I tell my family about his texts, they will say ""wah he can't move on ah.

I am currently a full-time student due to graduate within a year. I met my current (China) girlfriend 7 months ago and we have our ups and downs. We do enjoy each other's company and she seems to love me a lot.While I am her first boyfriend, she is not my first. She confessed to me after a few dates and we have been together since. The thing is, as much as I feel the need to care for her and look after her wellbeing, I do not feel a strong feeling of love to her nor anyone else, including my parents. I also do not feel strong emotions such as sadness. Is there such thing as being devoid of emotion ? I have been hurt deeply by a past relationship before, wondering if that could be the catalyst for the void? I tend to be very straightforward and tend not to be mindful of her feelings at times. However, I do apologise to her when I am in the wrong and attempt to make up for it by coaxing her with food. We also have different values but we try not to force them on each other. I see a future with her but I am afraid that the lack of 'love' for her may ruin everything.

1. I do want to be with her and spend my life with her but will such issues cause future problems between us, breaking the relationship?

We have quarrelled before such as why do I not do romantic things for her, post our pictures on social media (I have introduced her to my circle of friends and family), and a few other things along the lines of romanticism. Our sex life isn't that great because we do not engage in foreplay as she dislikes it. However, she frequently tries to initiate sex. 

2. Will this mismatch between us (love / sex life) cause problems in the future even though we are enjoying each other's company now?

She graduated recently and have started looking for a job. She intends to stay here with me but if she is unable to find a job here, she will return home. However, she does not believe in LDR and would rather that we break up if that becomes reality. I have assured her that even if we are in a LDR, we can make it work (video calls, travelling etc). The outlook doesn't seem optimistic to us, but I do not want the relationship to break apart because of uncontrollable factors.

3. Should I give up my 'freedom' to be with her in China or is there another way out?


Thank you for posting and reading this post. Any advice is greatly appreciated.


TLDR: Currently in a relationship but several problems may break the relationship. Need help.

381,"Hi fellow virtual friends, would appreciate for some advice on my current situation. Used to be a formal student in NUS :D

I have a close colleague turned friend whom I have been talking to rather frequently since early this year. We have been out on a few occasions for dinner/meet up as well and also been overseas together for short trips. 

Initially, I did not have any feelings for; but overtime, I have started to realise that I might have developed some feelings (although I’m not entirely certain)- as I do find myself upset when he doesn’t text me for the day and missing him being around me. I myself would not really initiate any conversation as it’s just not me. We are no longer colleagues now but still keep in close contact. 

He has otherwise yet to show any signs that he would like to progress this friendship further. On the other hand, we don’t really talk about relationship issues. However on one occasion, I had briefly mentioned that I did not feel ready for one. 

Do you think it is right if I talked to him about this issue? I’m afraid that it might ruin our friendship and that I might just be the one overthinking? Is it normal for a guy to be so close to a girl? I feel like it is causing me to fall deeper by being so close to me. I’m afraid and confused. I have not told anyone of my friends or family regarding this yet...

384,"I am, or rather was, close to one of my closest childhood friends, E, but her boyfriend was being unreasonably prejudiced towards me because he was under the notion that I was going to steal E from him, even though it was already well-established that I am gay . So, an incident broke the camel's back and nearly made E and I fall out, all because her boyfriend was being socially dense. Said boyfriend apologised for his actions in that incident but the apology sounded like ""I do not find myself in the wrong but I am apologising for the sake of apologising & E asked me to do so."" 
That attempt in apology diminished any form of reconciliation; I blue-ticked his apology. E also wanted me and her boyfriend to be netural towards each other. Furthermore, the friends in that circles also said that I should forgive him. 
I can't do it because the revelation of his prejudice and his apology was anything but sincere and thoughful. I felt hurt, knowing that I was treated differently from E's other friends since the very beginning and was uncertain if I should forgive him for the sake of the camaraderie of the social circle. Deciding to prioritise E's happiness in her marriage life over my decade-long friendship with her, I decided to avoid putting her in social situations where she had to choose between her boyfriend and me, because I knew she would be stressed having to pick between the both of us. However, that further strained the friendship and both of us were apparently suffering because she knew what I was doing about it, according to a friend. Said friend also said that the boyfriend ""wanted to make amends but OP was not letting him to."" It has been a year since the incident happened.
The question is: was I being unreasonable for not forgiving her boyfriend? Was I wrong to prioritize E's happiness with him over our decade-long friendship?

386,"I’m the guy behind post #78301 where my girlfriend has been neglecting me since even before I’m back from overseas.

So basically last Saturday I went to confront one of the “guy friends” of hers which I assume he likes her. 
I’m unsure how to explain this but when u saw a guy you can just tell that he actually likes your girl as a friend or with motives just by the way he looks at her. You just can tell. (Victim herself probably couldn’t and keep coming up with lies and well idk or she just love the attention of guys.)

Anyway I confronted him despite my girlfriend previously keeps claiming they just “friends” and he have no motives. Guess what? I was right he told me in the face that he likes my girlfriend and his willing to break his current gf to be with her. YEAH break his “current gf” to be with “my gf.” I almost punch the guy in the face seriously cannot take this anymore.. but fine at least I have an answer now that I was right all the way.

Anw Sunday I manage to get my gf out for HTHT again but face to face this time round instead of calls or messages. And I told her all this so basically she was shocked as she doesn’t believe me because she think boy girl friendship exist. (Totally fine they do, just rarely or I think so)

Anyway after telling her all this she somehow still doubt me and think that I'm making it up.
So yeah I did what guys should do instead of continuing be in this pain I broke up with her. (Really wish I recorded the freaking convo to confront her making her speechless)

Well at least now i no longer have to suffer this pain of neglecting, under prioritised  and heartache.

Thanks y’all for support.

390,"Hi everyone,

I am an incoming exchange student from the UK. I know that Singapore is a very developed country, but there is something that I have been unable to wrap my head around. I have a question about the drinking water supply in Singapore.

I heard that Singapore uses waste water (a.k.a. “s**t water”) as one of its source of water supply. May I know if nus is located in one of the districts which uses this waste water? If the answer is yes then I’ll make sure I buy bottled water every day I’m here. 

Additionally, may I know how do you use these waste water for your daily needs? Specifically at which step of the water do you withdraw waste water from to shower, wash clothes etc? For example, if I want to obtain water to shower, should I scoop water out from the toilet reservoir, toilet bowl, or pipes beneath the sink?

Thank you in advance, and I look forward to seeing all of you in Singapore!

395,"Seeing that nowadays NUSWhispers is a nationwide platform, just wanted to get some opinion on this topic:

Today I discovered a Facebook vlog page that shows the British vlogger trying to get free food and services by making lies, fake claims and so on. And it seemed to have worked everytime, everywhere, from getting free MacDonalds meal in the US to getting free entries to luxury hotels. So the comments are always divided between people condemning him and people who supports it. 

For me, I think what he is doing is no different than the Caucasian begpackers, basically trying to get food/lodging/services for free by offering nothing in return. While I was in Europe, I always explore the small towns including those non-touristy spots and it is difficult getting service even though I speak the local language (not very fluent but understandable), usually they brush you off by making you wait unnecessarily long or just simply saying they’re on their last order, yet you see people walking in. 

I have a feeling this vlogger going to try this in Asia soon and generally most Asians usually suck up to the angmoh’s so his “trick” should work really well. I’m against it as I think it is wrong in principle. Just curious what do you guys think?

396,"To #73850 and other eczema sufferers: (a long post ahead)

I'm suffering from eczema as well and can understand the mental and emotional turmoil. Sharing my experience since my last flare up was more than half a year ago and my condition has been stable except when I tried to be funny by eating foods I shouldn't be eating.

Please try not to apply steroid creams even when dermatologists tell you to because it only suppresses the symptoms and does not treat the underlying cause. However, when you first stop your steroid intake, you'll probably experience what they call Topical Steroid Withdrawal. It's a horrible experience but it'll be alright after you go through this phase. To lessen the pain when you bathe, do not use the typical bath shampoo but use bath oil. For me, I use Oatmeal Bath Oil from Derma**** by applying it before I wet my body with water. It does help to lessen the pain from the open wounds.

I was also told that we have flare ups because there is something wrong with the body, like our liver is overworked while detoxifying our body. So one of the best ways to counter this is to have a cleaner diet by trying to abstain or lower your intake of certain foods which can trigger your eczema. Certain foods include high histamine food, night shades, dairy and nuts. Also try to avoid preservatives and processed foods.

Finally, if possible, get supplies of antihistamines like Zyrtec from a polyclinic to help with the itch (cold presses help too). Very cliche to say to stop scratching.. but it's really a need to break the scratch itch cycle that I still cannot do.. Now that NSC is conducting a clinical trial for a new drug, I hope it helps all of us eczema sufferers. :)

I have a lot of friends who went to civil service and are pretty satisfied with their career. Personally, I went into Tech as a UX Researcher which I would advise many of you to look into.

The compensation for this role is pretty much the same as Software Engineers. Most of my peers have received around 4+ to 7k as fresh graduates. Despite the hype for CS and S.E., many other roles in Tech are much better in Singapore in terms of compensation, working hours and responsibility - UX roles being one of them.

Other than psychology modules, I believe having internships in related roles as well as doing some CS courses such as Human-Computer Interaction will go a long way. Good luck!

I realise people misunderstood when I said stay with locals in a share house. I stayed with the British students of the local UK uni not Singaporean locals.

DONT STAY WITH SINGAPOREANS IN A PRIVATE APARTMENT!! 

That's what happened to the large group of Singaporeans who went to Sheffield uni and stayed together. It's more difficult to mix with the British students. You'll regret it. 


The Singaporean student who stayed on campus had other exchange students living next door. Tbh, it's fun to meet other intl students but they kinda stuck to their own clique from their home countries. Most are Erasmus students with 3-5 min coming from each European country. They all know each other.

Travelling to Europe because air tickets from London to other European countries are cheap? I stuck to UK, went to other cities in UK by train. But if you want to go around to Paris, Venice etc, yes, ticket is cheap. Who's gonna pay for the Airbnb, travelling within the city, food, sightseeing? Food is very expensive and you'd be so grateful for our foodcourts.

Studying full time in London? That's a lot of money and a great experience if you want to mix with intl students. But sticking to smaller cities like Manchester, Liverpool, Nottingham allow you to mingle with the average British person.

I stand by my statement. London is expensive. An exchange is a wonderful exposure and I hope those with less money go for exchange. It is possible to go for exchange to UK, just go to a smaller city.  Get the 4K bursary to pay for flight and accomodation for 5 months and your own personal savings to spend.

401,"I used to have eczema too when i was younger. It was really frustrating.

Then things got better when i realised the causal factors and adjusted my lifetstyle. Poor diet, lack of sleep and stress. You have to make sure you eat healthily and exercise.

Avoid Junk food, especially sugary stuff. They cause inflammation, which will make your body want to expel those nasty stuff expeditiously, through the largest organ of your body, the skin. Hence the rash.

Get enough sleep. Your body needs to rejuvenate and recover. Dont stress too much over stuff, health is more important. Exercise. All the best.

403,"Commented this on one of the confession about being fat and insulted. Thought that I should share here too with everyone. Not an expert here though, just wanna share my experience. I hope everyone can view this positively. 

Hello! I was in a similar situation as you. The only difference is my mom won’t insult me but I did reach a point where even she agrees that I needed to do something about my tummy fats at 162cm 53kg.

At that time, I started dating as well. So I started spending money on slimming products, do core exercises (not knowing there is no such thing as spot reduction) and running sometimes. Slowly, I learn more and I know what to do. I’ve reached 46kg now.

I understand the mental and emotional struggle because I was being insulted at by my sis too :( She would say mean things to me and I was very affected sometimes. I was NOT fat. I am skinny fat. My arms and legs are slim but my tummy is fat. However, someone told me to view negative comments positively, try seeing the insult as a motivation to prove what you can achieve. At first I thought, that person doesn't understand me. It's not so easy to do it and I will not be happy to go on a diet and I don't like to exercise. But I keep reminding myself to be positive.

In a desperate attempt to slim down. I purchase a popular product called SoSlim from Fashion Shelter (@fashionshelter on Instagram). It's very expensive but I was desperate and no harm trying from so many positive reviews + it is locally approved. This product works, no dieting or exercising needed but process is slow. Results are evident but super slow. This is based on personal experience though. In 1 week, I lose 2cm around my waist and 1cm around my thigh.

Slowly, I incorporated some core exercises like leg raise, crunches and plank. I run once to twice per month and do 10-20 minutes hula hoop every night. I did cut down about 1 kg after doing this for about 1 month.

Later on, I read articles about dieting. It is true that 70% is on dieting and 30% on exercising. Yes, it's so frustrating to finally acknowledge this but I was determined to slim down (especially I want to wear nicer clothes and I found out that my bf likes slimmer girls, that doesn't mean you should slim down for other people, do it for yourself to look good feel good). I read about intermittent fasting, this is eating in a 8 hours window in a day. But I thought, 8 hours is too less for me so I try to eat within 10 hours window. My weight significantly dropped but I didn't keep track though. I tried caloric deficit too. Meaning, I consume lesser calories than what I burn or something like that. I'd make sure my calories intake in within 1200 per day and I used MyFitnessPal to keep track. Wasn't happy about counting calories all the time though..

WARNING: I ate lesser and tried to skip breakfast too. One day I ate too much at 10pm, the next day, I had a very bad episode of gastric pain and was admitted into the hospital. So don't eat tooooo full suddenly if you go on a diet.

While doing all these, I continued using SoSlim. I had manage to cut to 48kg in about 3 months. I tried going gym after that. My bf helped me a lot when I decided that I want to try weightlifting. Gym is intimidating for me but I overcame it and going with someone helps a lot too. I am currently doing a few of these in the gym: Romanian deadlift, glutes kickback, cable pull (not sure what this is called but I used this to target glutes), barbell squats, abs bench and the same core exercises. I went for a run once a week as well and my weight dropped to about 47.5kg and I was stuck at around that weight for some time (this is NORMAL).

As I start to gym, I started dieting as well. Sounds awful right? Indeed it is but not soooo bad. I stopped counting calories after knowing roughly how much I should consume a day. After the gastric episode, I eat breakfast now. A small bun or anything small is good. Lunch I'd eat normally and anything I want but LESS rice or noodle. Once 80% full, I'll stop. So when I dabao, I'll said LESSS rice / noodle. Make sure there is a meat, vegetable and something else. Dinner I'll go for mixed veg rice WITHOUT rice. Usually I'll order chicken, egg and vegetables. I hate vegetables but I'm forcing myself to eat along with something I like which is chicken and egg. No keto diet because I love rice. Lesser snacking on chips too. No fast food too (one per three months is okay). Lesser sweet drinks too but milo is my weakness XD I'd still snack and eat something sweet still though, like a treat for myself HAHA

Lastly, I was stuck at 47.5kg for some time so I tried taking Apple Cider Vinegar for a week. Didn't see significant drop but I stopped after 1 week and I can see my weight starting to drop again. After resting for 2 weeks, I started drinking for another week along with SoSlim, gym, and careful diet, I finally reached to where I am now at 46kg. I am actually already underweight. However, at this weight, my belly fat is still there. I can't wear tight dress without looking nice at my tummy area. My tummy is totally NOT flat at all. It is still flabby. I'm saying this not to discourage you but I want to emphasize that it takes a long time, give yourself a year. Don't give up! Sometimes it's okay to slack for a week but you have to continue. The reward is that I am able to wear tighter shorts/skirt hehehe

It's 1am so pardon my english XD PM me if you want to know more, I'm willing to help because I understand and I hope to motivate some girls out there! I took pictures of my tummy throughout my journey as well and the difference is significant. PM me too if you wanna see XD All girls out there, love yourself, love your body. Please take care even if you want to slim down to look good okies

Here's my experience of a semester in the UK. I paid for it fully from my own savings so for students who are worried about money, don't.

1. NUS bursary is a lifesaver. They gave me 4K. That paid for my  flights to and from and my accomodation.
2. I spent about 2K on flight. Not sure of the exact amount.
3. Don't be a scared Singaporean and stay in campus halls. It's expensive. I paid $240/month for a private share house and walked 20mins to uni. The Singaporean who stayed on campus paid $500 and got a smaller space and stayed with intl students but I stayed with 2 locals students.

5. Any shopping, sightseeing, trains within UK was from my own savings. There are student discounts for almost everything.
6. Don't need to travel the entire Europe just because youre in the UK. Take your semester to immerse fully and enjoy the British life. London isn't the only place to visit.

416,"Hi everyone, recently I’ve many issues with my gf. My gf is someone who have way more male friends and more comfortable with Male friends than female friends. So this is the story: I’ve been overseas intern for 3 months and during the first month we still message each other a lot and despite the different in time zone and I still make effort to play her favourite video games. (We been playing for a awhile even before going overseas)

Since this period it looks like she made some new friends from school to play with her and thats totally fine because making friends right?

But the issues is they hang out like almost every single day and since making “these few guy friends” our messages and convo dropped significantly and even when I’m back in Singapore she stopped hanging out with me. I trust her and I told her about how I don’t like that she prioritised her friends over me and I’m willing to make the effort to spent time with her. I’ve also told her that I have friends who are close with the guy and they claim that his flirty and clingy and always looking for target to work on. 

After telling her and we had many quarrels because she felt like I’m controlling her.. and she totally doesn’t believe me and she thinks I’m doing all this because Im jealous.. all I want is to spent some time with her.. am I wrong? It’s been about just over 5 months now, she still comes out with me once in awhile.. (once or twice a month rtx) and I’ve been feeling extremely upset about this and it looks like the situation might  stay the same and I’ve no idea how to fix this..

Can anyone offer some advice? Thanks you!

418,"Hey #83772

Hi there, I decided to respond to your qn: what ruins a healthy long term relationship

Anonymously. Because I want to be truthful.

Truth is, a lot of “luck” is involved. Yes you read that right. 

I for one have a child and a loving wife. We are married for more than ten years. But there were so many times the stability which I built everything upon (condo, career, car, etc) was so easy to just recklessly abandon to my “luck” of attracting the attention of someone of the opposite sex I could only have dreamed of. 

Of course I will do no evil to destroy what good I have built for myself any my family. Yes I sound irresponsible to even mention it but it is that easy to ruin a long term relationship. Because it feels like “luck” than “misfortune”. 

How do you avoid this? You can’t. You simply have to possess a very rewarding relationship to the point it makes little “economical” sense to abandon your stable relationship. I find that treasuring a long term relationship is much harder than short ones because we take “today” for granted. Cannot have dinner today? Nvm tmr. Cannot go holiday this year? Nvm next yr. You will be around me wat. 

No no no. Never assume. 

One golden rule I learnt is that I should never look at a relationship based on months or years, but just today. Am I happy with the relationship? Am I contributing to the relationship? What can I do about it? But I never question if the other party is contributing to the relationship. Because if that is actually a question in your head, YOU GOT THE WRONG PERSON MATE. Really, you have no control over how much the other half contributes to the relationship. It is like an “inborn” thing that cannot be tutored or nagged into the brain. So naturally, this gives you a good hint on what to look for in a potential partner in a long term relationship: a person who is constantly finding ways to contribute to the relationship WITHOUT PROMPT from you. Seems rare to find such a person and if you do, it cannot be ruined right? WRONG. It is a lot easier to take for granted and even easier to ruin than an unrewarding relationship. Because we do take good things for granted. 

How easy it is to ruin a long term relationship even when both are deeply invested in the relationship? Here are some tried and tested tricks from my divorced friends:

A sacarstic tease here, a spurt of “bloody fool” or “lazy pig”, a wall of anger with a few “don’t even touch me” day here and there, a few rant of complaints doubting the loyalty of your better half spilled to mutual friends... the sort that you tell everyone except your other half, etc.... these can really build up over time and sometimes “luck” just checks in to see how you are- and becomes the hay that breaks the camel’s back. 

Let me tell you about this “luck”. I call it “luck” because that is exactly how it feels when you are at the maginot line of self-destruction. 

When you build yourself up like a fortress, you do “luckily” attract attention of the... sexual kind. It can come from varying sources but because they are “by chance” moments it is always easier to say no than to succumb to it. But really easier said than done when the initiating party gets bolstered by your confusion and advances steadily. I hate myself for letting my imagination run wild sometimes and I usually dive deeper into my work to stop the nonsense spilling into reality. I have also developed a wall of party tricks to avoid these disasters because I really value the loyalty of my wife and I believe she deserves nothing less. 

Some of my friends weren’t so lucky. So which sex more guilty one ah? is it husband or wife more? Nowadays sama-sama. How old are the relationships? Got kids involved, in primary schools. Terrible when you think, but really, in the eyes of the beholder, they were simply rationalizing a strode of “luck” that fell on their lap. 

I never even put money/debt or sudden health issue (e.g. car accident) or nasty relatives (the sibling who always come and spill trouble) into the equation and long term relationship is already so easy to ruin. 

So treat every relationship that comes to you as fragile as a wine glass. It will bring you happiness when the daily grind ends with a free flow of “wine” falling from the sky every night without fail (“wine” here refers to a satisfying happiness which stability brings at the end of the day). Those who have glass will fill it to the brim and sip over supper with their partner. 

But if you meet people that likes to smash your glass into pieces all the time? Well you just gotta find someone mature enough to enjoy a glass of wine every night, not a berzerker who smashes your life and hopefully he/she can be tamed someday to do this long term relationship thing. A few sips of this “free” wine really change your life and show you how beautiful life can be when savored in its simplest elements as a reflection of your memories.

I've seen too many relationships fail and i really dont understand why 

What you advice you can give to someone looking for a relationship?

And 

What exactly ruins a healthy long term relationship? 

If i were to answer my question;
Expectations of your partner is the only problem. And the best partner one that has nothing to offer but love. Someone who isn't the most goodlooking, someone who doesn't have money to give, someone who doesn't have time to spare. If they have nothing to give but love, you won't spend your relationship expecting things from your partner and getting upset. I'd say it is possible to love without giving anything. 

What do you think?

After I tendered, they became much more passive aggressive and insulting. I was given an ultimatum to complete a detailed list of all of my work within less than a day as I was informed at night and they wanted it the morning after. If not, they threatened to give me a bad reference to all my future employers. As I tendered right on the date where I’m able to get my bonus, they also told me that my bonus will decrease because of my departure. 

Is there anyone who has been through something similar and how did you deal with handling such unprofessional people? I’ve thought of going to MOM but that is more on wages rather than workplace harassment.

I don’t wear sleeveless tops or dresses because I’m insecure and I feel that my arms look really fat. At first, I had no problem with my body. But as I grew older, my mum constantly criticized my body, and my sister also liked to call me fat because she’s way skinnier than me. I tried to laugh it off and pretended that i didn’t care. But I did. As I looked through social media, everyone seemed to be pretty except me. I can no longer look into the mirror without feeling sad, even though my friends try to encourage me and say that I look skinny. Recently, I have a wedding dinner coming up and my mum forced me to buy a dress because ‘你的衣服没有一件可以见人’, which loosely translates into none of your clothes are nice. When I try to buy clothes for myself, she would either say it’s ugly or I look fat in it. And I would feel like crying and have no mood to shop, which is probably why I have limited clothes in my closet. It’s so hard to love myself, what should I do?

I know what I am about to say is horrible to an extent and possibly unfair. While I really appreciate his love, I cant help but feel my feelings for him has dwindled. It has taken me a long time to accept my feelings but I must admit I have fallen for another man. He is an exchange student from the united states. Yes, he is caucasian, but this was not what made me fall in love with him.
I found a lot of traits in him that I seem to find lacking in my boyfriend, he is very independent, motivated, and passionate about his dreams. He told me he wishes to join the Marine to serve his country, and I feel it was really mature and patriotic of him. He is also very sensitive and romantic, he offers me his jacket when he thinks i am cold. Small actions like these really touches me.
With my boyfriend, he tends to complain about his reservist duties and I always try my best to cheer him up. He doesnt have much ambition other than getting a job and applying for a BTO. I know it is hard for singapore guys to have reservist, but I am tired of dealing with his complaints.
I did not cheat on my boyfriend because i do not wish to hurt him. But John, not his real name, has told me to end my relationship with my boyfriend and to be with him.
I am certain of my feelings for John, but at the same time, my boyfriend still really loves me and I don't wish to hurt him. Can any girls who have been through such a situation before give me any advice?

I have been dating this girl through university and after (3 years). We spent a lot of good times together, shared similar life goals and drive, and have so much memories together. We also got to meet and know each others' family - loving and caring for them together. Life is such a bliss and I thought she was the one. 

However, everything fell apart five months ago. She started her work and went into society, and we had different schedules, priorities etc. There were also things she didn't like about me, and that I am partly at fault too. Anyway, Love was not strong enough to hold everything together. When 'reality' kicks in, finances, more and better options out there - she was still young and quite a catch, so things ended with us.

I still have feelings for her, and such memories are difficult to let go. I saw her as part of my family. But at the same time, I cannot control what she does or choosing to 'upgrade' to someone else. The pain is excruciating as I've given my all and she was a close one.

Anyways, what I want to bring across is, girls also have pride de, since she is willing to listen to you that night, although she seems like she isn’t, means she has cooled down to a certain extent already, so it’s your turn to apologise (no matter if it’s your fault or not JUST SAY THE WORD SORRY) and give her a hug after that.

No, you do not need to convert to Muslim to be with your guy. My mom is chinese and my dad is Malay. My mom never converted to muslim as she does not believe in it. My dad never forced my mom nor his kids. My brother converted when he was 16 and I am still not a muslim. We follow my dad’s name. 

For food wise, we eat separately unless there are big events. We have halal and non halal sets of everything.

I think it’s how the family arrange.

In my line of work, I only code using only a few stacks, but I would like to explore more technologies and learn about infrastructure and cybersecurity, things that I didn't learn because I went through a 1-year crash course on coding, development and programming instead of a full undergraduate course from NUS Computing (I was from Life Sciences). I already plan my time well, but somehow I don't have a whole chunk of time to dwell into learning new tech, nor do I have the motivation when I return home at like 9-10pm at night after tutoring. Should I just suck it up and find that motivation to learn at night, or are there other ways I can learn?

459,"Hi all, just need to rant and maybe seek some advice here. I've been in a 3 years relationship with my girlfriend. I'm 22 and she's 21. She is the sweetest, most attractive and most genuine woman I've known, but this statement is only applicable when she is in a good mood. Recently, we've been in a series of arguement and she is currently giving me the cold shoulders, on and off. For instance, last week, she desperately wanted to have her milo dinosaur, but since she was down with the flu, I stopped her and gave her warm water instead. She got pissed and stopped eating and simply watched me eat instead. The next day, she was back to her normal self again.

However, few days later, we argued again about cleaning her room. We have been living together for 2 months, with a maid, in another apartment, owned by her parents. Usually the maid will do the chores but she is on leave for 3 weeks due to some family issues at her hometown, so naturally, we had to do the chores. I started to tidy her room, including the wardrobe, toilet and her makeup table for her as it is in a mess, and vacuum it right after, but she got irritated, and questioned the purpose of arranging stuff when it's gonna be messy later on. Okay, I admit, I'm a clean freak so I cannot stand how messy things are. So, she got angry, and I've got chased out of her room since then. She doesn't even want to talk to me now and have been out with her girlfriends everyday to avoid me.

Yesterday night, after she got back home, I tried talking to her since I feel that things need to be fixed in this relationship. Although she was playing games on her phone and acted like she wasn't listening, I know she was. But she simply didn't want to contribute anything to the 'discussion'. I'm at wits end. I still love her, I'm willing to do the chores for her too but I feel like this relationship is reaching it's end after this fight. Love experts, help me, how can I make her things better. Please don't advice me to break up, because it won't be an option, unless she sincerely wants to.

I am a Chinese, but my boyfriend is a Malay. I want to be with him forever, but i dont want to convert to Muslim. It's not that i dont love him. I do love him, but im not a religious person. I dont think it is right to convert to a religion that i dont believe in.

I always asked him if we can just remain in our current religion when we get married, but he cant give me an answer.

With him, i can eat halal food (though i like non halal food more hahaha) or even accompany him on whatever festive (like Ramadhan). I wish we can reach a compromise. I dont want to lose him just because of religion issue.

I had a very weird dream about this girl from my course. It's at a public place, where we coincidentally walked past and had an eye contact, but and she was with another guy, while I'm alone. I was surprised to see her, and when I turned back to look at her again, I saw that they entered either in a restaurant or cafe (I can't really remember it well, since that's not the important part).

As I kept walking, suddenly I felt someone jumping into my back and holding on to me. I turned my head around and noticed she was the one who jumped onto me. After that she suddenly talked to me and brought me to meet the guy she was with. It felt so surreal that the next thing I knew, I woke up feeling weird.

I know it sounds creepy, but has anyone experienced this before? Or is it just me?

466,"Hello everyone,

I am a French girl currently on exchange at NUS, and I would like to share with you a bad experience that I had at one of the hawker centres on campus soon after I arrived, as I would like to know what Singaporeans would think about it. 

I am quite a health conscious girl, and I pay a lot of attention to what I eat, especially regarding the quality and sourcing of the primary ingredients; I want to know where the food comes from and for example for meat, in what conditions the animals were reared, for vegetables and rice if the producer uses organic and environmentally friendly farming methods, for eggs if they are free range, etc... 

So when I ordered some chicken rice at a stall, I asked the lady if she could tell me where the rice and the chicken came from, how they were reared, and if she knew the producer. She seemed really angry after I asked her the question, and started scolding at me in Singlish, and unfortunately (or fortunately maybe) I couldn’t understand what she was saying, but I interpreted it as “you are insulting me and my food, and if you are not happy, you can go find food elsewhere”. I want to make clear that I asked the question very politely and in a friendly way, and that I didn’t intend to hurt that lady in any way. However, don’t you think that it is normal to want to know where the primary ingredients of the food that you are eating are coming from? I mean food is your body’s fuel, and as Hippocrates said, “let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.”

I don’t understand her reaction, and I wanted to know if from a Singaporean point of view, my questions were seen as rude. In France, even in a small and simple family restaurant, asking this kind of question is not seen as rude at all, quite the opposite, as it shows the chef that you are interested in his work and appreciating his food by wanting to know more about it, and he/she will happily tell you about it. It is also quite frequent that restaurant owners, especially in the countryside, directly source their primary ingredients from the producer.

Also, I noticed that food culture in Singapore is very important (which is great, as it is the same in France, and I love that!), however, it seems to me that Singaporeans don’t pay a lot of attention to the origin and quality of the primary ingredients, which is a paradox to me as from good ingredients results tasty and healthy food. So to all Singaporeans, what do you think about this topic? Do you agree or disagree with me? 

Thanks for reading my long post, and don’t hesitate to let me know in the comments what you think about all that, and if you can relate to my experience!

From a French girl who loves Singapore, Singaporean food, and NUS!

468,"If anyone is keen to hear me out and provide me with some advice regarding SEP, I’d be more than grateful! I’m a fass student this year who applied for exchange next year. Though the results are not out yet, I’m wondering if I should actually accept if I do get an offer. My main concern lies with the expenses. My family is not well to do and local U expenses itself is something we can only manage to get by with. I take on part-time jobs though i admit, it’s quite a struggle at times with the heavy workload as a double major. I’ve tried applying for scholarships but never got a reply, not even a chance at an interview. Even though my results were not stellar, neither was I the cream of the crop, they were at the very least above average and I was able to go to “elite” schools and do well there. But not even an interview opportunity? :( 

Personally, I think SEPs are the best opportunities to get exposed to a education elsewhere that is ‘just right’ - not for the whole of undergrad, yet not short enough for the experience to be unrepresentative. And it’s a great way to open one’s eyes to the big big world out there. I think it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity, to study abroad as an undergrad and have sufficient liberty to still enjoy and be exposed to other culture. And I know that there are bursaries or even loans available, but I’m just not sure and I don’t want to add more financial burdens to my family. So to those who have been in similar shoes, may I have a rough gauge for the expenses for exchange to UK and Aus? And do you all think it’s worth it to get a loan just to go on a SEP?

I have no idea how valuations work and all. It started out as a cool side project but then people started taking notice and the project was eventually monetized. Now a big company is considering buying my project for huge (6 fig) sum

Part of me wants to just cashout and reap the rewards but part of me also feels like perhaps there is potential for something more? I am lost. I don't know how to decide. 

Is there anyone I can seek advice from or any resources NUS has to help us navigate this journey? Google doesn't help at this point. 

Also, if I suddenly receive a huge sum of money in my bank account, will I alert the authorities? Like will I be questioned on the origin of the money? 

I haven't told anyone as I don't want my friends to see me differently, I still want a normal uni life. If people were to find out that I own a 6 figure business either they'll most likely want to use me or they'll think i'm just rubbing it in their face. I can't ask anyone in real life as a result.

491,"Seeking for honest opinions. Sorry, it will be a very long story. No trolls please.
I'm average-looking and I’m currently going out with a guy that’s 7 years older than me and is a working adult. He is attractive, smart, modest, humorous, has a well-paying job, very popular and most important of all, he has a good personality. I have some mutual friends that that has told me that he always tries his best to keep a distance from girls that approaches him as well.

We really love each other and always make consistent effort to try our best to spend time with each other, with him working around with his hectic working life and with me managing my examinations, projects, etc. He treats me very well, understands me, and is always the first to notice if I’m in a sour mood after going through a bad day. Occasionally we do have our quarrels and fights due to our differences, but we managed to resolve it and stick together despite it all, accepting the other for who we are. In overall, we are together with each other for a good 1.5 years.

I know all of this sounds too good to be true, and all this while I'm trying my best to improve myself to be better - be it in terms of working on my appearance, personality, learning new skills, etc. so that I would be able to better match up with him.

But here's the catch – at the beginning of the relationship, my family knows about it and objects to him, saying that he's too good for me and that he's not taking me seriously, as well as saying about some other really nasty stuff about him without knowing him all that well, which was not really fair to him. Of course, knowing that it definitely wasn't true, I tried to speak up for him, but they said that I was very blinded by him and that I should really face reality and wake up, why would someone of such a good calibre want me. 

I discussed about this with him and it landed a really huge blow to him, as he's really very concerned about the opinions of the people around me and he was depressed for quite a long period of time. He was really understanding and understands that my family just wanted the best for me and that it was normal for parents to be protective of their child, but was still very hurt from their comments nonetheless. He told me that it’s okay and I should not worry my family, let them think that we have broken off, and keep our relationship from my family for the time being and we will figure out a way to solve this somehow eventually. I tried to talk to him, cheer him up, but to no avail. We continued sticking together and after a few months, he went back to his normal cheerful self. My family still suspects me going out with him from time to time and was quite unhappy, but kept silent about it, only occasionally dropping hints here and there and prompted me about it.

He was very depressed to the point where his family noticed the changes in him, and was really concerned about him. After asking him about it and knowing about my family’s objections and hurtful remarks, his family, who had really liked me at the start, started hating on me with the same intensity of how much they had liked me previously. They were really angered by my family’s unjustified comments about their son. I only knew about later on where he kept me knowing about this all this while and only briefly told me that his family knows about this matter a year later. However, he did not tell me that his family hated me because he was afraid that I would be hurt. It was only then afterwards where I found out from my mutual friends about they hated me.

His family knows that we are still together and although they disagree to it, they still respected my S/O’s opinion and did not say anything much about us. However, recently, his family has started rushing him for marriage and asked when would he be able to bring a good partner home, to which, he replied to them jokingly to give him a year and he would find one girl to bring home (cause he’s in his late 20s, they are worried, and I think, they really object to us being together, hence asking those). He did not tell me about this because he was scared that I would overthink, it was from the mutual friend where I found out about this.  

Honestly, I don't know what to do anymore. I’m having thoughts where I think I’m keeping him from finding his right one, but still, I really don’t want to leave him. I’m not telling him about this because I do not want him to worry about me. I’m very confused. What are your opinions on this?

I'm a girl and I have high sex drive. The problem is, it's getting out of hand (especially recently during finals). I had to relieve myself multiple times while studying and it interrupted my studies a lot. :/ I'm getting quite frustrated with it and at the same time I'm scared I'll lose control one day...
I don't want an fwb because I can't separate emotions and sex, and I don't want to get a boyfriend just for sex (Kinda emotional as you can see lol). So far I don't have anyone I'm interested in (yes I like guys), and I can't get a sex toy because my parents will definitely find out. It doesn't help that I'm also shy/nervous around guys that I'm interested in, meaning my chances with them are usually not very high

Is there anything wrong with me? What should I do? I'm scared to tell this to anyone because my female friends don't see to have this problem or are all attached, and I don't want to talk to my male friends about this either as I don't want to give them the wrong idea. And it's just a very awkward topic, haha. I don't think my friends expect that I'm like this, much less my parents... please advice

I’m an only child too. Worse still, my dad stayed with his parents and unmarried sibling, and they expect me to be a surrogate child and provide for them.

My grandma has 6 kids and 10 grandchildren, but I’m the only one to bring her for medical appointments. My uncle used to take care of her needs until he fell ill himself. They now expect me to move back to take care of the 5 old folks at home, and bring them to the doctor. 

I had to draw my boundaries clearly and refuse, knowing that all the financial burden and time spent on medical appts (we’re talking about 1-2 appts weekly) would be foisted to me by all the cousins. I don’t understand why dad’s unmarried siblings would expect me to pay and spend most of my annual leave ferrying then to the drs when my cousins drive and are earning so much more(close to or over 5 digits for half the cousins), and they knew I used up all my leave on part time studies. 

Some welfare group has been by and offered them aid too. They rejected and said relatives would help, then promptly called me and demanded that I buy or rent the required items for them. Not sure if its their pride, but I sure wish they would distribute the burden out more evenly. They would tell me there is nobody else, but when I insisted on not having any leave, they managed to find another cousin who brought him to the doctor.

Then at the bench rack I saw this average looking guy with weightlifting shoes, and I was amazed by the amount of weight on the bar given his physique and size. I asked if we could share and he looked at me for awhile before grunting and nodding impatiently. As I was removing the plates I felt a bit embarrassed but it was my usual routine so I didn’t want to start my workout with other exercises. When it was his turn I helped him to put all the plates back in, which was super heavy for me, as he was putting the plates he was quite disgruntled and kept mumbling impatiently. I felt paiseh at that moment. 

And then, He. Started. Quarter. Repping. Moving like less than an inch. Afterwards slamming the bar back onto the rack. 

On one hand, I was relieved that I wasn’t hindering a serious lifter’s progress. On the other hand, why did he behave in such a rude manner when he was not a pro from the start? Most people at the school gym that I’ve seen are rather humble.

Slowly and steadily, people starts to move on, and gradually stops talking to you. When you are still friends with the clique, you are always the only one asking them out, or they would just casually say we should have an outing, but it always didn't happen. 

You didn't know what happened, and after 1 year, seeing everyone else having fun with their friends, you find yourself having no friends at all, and being all alone. From what used to be people celebrating your birthday, to a point in time where no one wishes you anymore. 

From being with a group of friends with joy, to seeing them enjoying themselves without you. You realised you are a toxic friend, and slowly things have turned out this way, yet you are unsure of what to do. You search online, only to see pages of information, saying to avoid toxic people, but no information of helping a toxic person to change themselves for the better.

Thus I would like to have some opinions, how can I change myself for the better, so that I would not be a toxic person anymore, and be able to make friends with people again, and falling in love with someone?

My parents aren’t singaporean but I’ve been a singaporean PR since the I was born. My parents have been in Singapore since primary school too. I would say that I’m pretty singaporeanized while my parents still identify more with their home country. They told me that I would not need to give them any part of their salary because they don’t need it. They’re pretty financially stable as well. 

Just want to point out to the harsh commenters that there are cultural differences in the idea of gratitude. In my home country, the norm is not to give money to their parents. If parents have the financial stability, they would rather want their kids to keep the money as it is more practical. I mean it is also dependent on the financial stability of the parents as every family is different. 

Just want to make it a point that everyone’s idea of gratitude is different. My parents did not give money to my grandparents too. We mostly show gratitude and filial piety through non-monetary means, like going on holiday together, spending time together, go out for meals. I was new to the fact that my singaporean friends were giving money to their parents as well. It is all dependent on culture, financial stability and really, what your parents want. I also understand that I am privileged and grateful that my parents are pretty well off, hence they don’t need my money.

For example, he can be really irresponsible, doesn’t take care of himself despite everyone telling him to do so and also so lazy to the extend he is able to sleep the whole day away (even when he has plans or work). 
And when we have issues, he will rather run away than to solve them together (even though there were some instances he will pluck up his courage to face them, the bulk of it was him running away).

I’ve been very supportive in terms of helping him, encouraging him. However, recently I’ve had enough of him repeating the same mistakes over and over again. It feels like I’m wasting my effort when he is always saying he will change, but in the end he doesn’t. So much so that recently I’ve been flaring up at him and my tone towards him has changed. 
 Do I have to re-evaluate this relationship?  I’m at a loss.

My parents have been telling me since young that after I graduate, I need to give them some of my salary. I have no problem with this as I do love my parents, and thank them for bringing me up. But others, how much do you normally give?

My parents and I came to a conclusion of 25% of my salary a month, so assuming I get 4k upon graduation, 20% to cpf and 25% to my parents, I only have roughly 2k left i suppose.

All these tension is hurt our relationship and my opinion of my parents. My boyfriend and I are still trying to heal from this.

I have heard of stories where a guy was cut off by his family because he married someone from another race. 2 ladies whose parents objected/ overly protective are now still very single in their 30s. 

And I just want to know.. 
1) Has anyone been a victim of parental objection and did you resolve it? How do you stage the opportunities for your significant other to gain brownie points. Did they eventually accepted him? Or
2) Are there a people who have been cut away from their parents because you eventually chose to marry your SO. But were there eventual improvement to your relationship with them?

3) Off topic a bit, we communicate about it before knowing money can get sensitive, but how do people manage money contribution in a marraige when one earns more than the other. Especially in a patriarchal leaning society where people expect guys to be the breadwinner.

550,"#73318 I don't understand, let's try to break it down. 
$500k for a 4-5room HDB is on the high side, but lets just assume its 500k. 

To have 500k in cash when you've just graduated is crazy, but the downpayment required if you're taking a bank loan is 25%, of which 20% can be paid using CPF. Let's assume you and your spouse's CPF combined can only cover 10%, which leaves 75k in cash. Assuming you're not eligible for any grants at all (which is highly unlikely), Working about 3 years after graduation should comfortable net you this amount (both the 50k in CPF and 75k cash on hand) and this is assuming both you and your spouse have $0 upon graduation, which again is very unlikely.

So the remaining $375k on loan, if it is over 30 years it works out to a monthly repayment of $1042, let's just say $1100 after accounting for interest (but after 2 years you can do repricing, so the actual will be less than the 5.5% interest I'm implying).

Assuming your $400 to parents is actually $800 because both sides' parents, that works out to about $3000 in expenditure (of which $200 is in investments which should grow over time, but  lets just treat it as gone). This leaves you with a disposible income of $3300 (I'm also assuming your $7k income is before CPF deduction). Upon paying loan of $1100 you have $2200 left. Spend $500 on your weekends dates you have an extra 1700 to put into savings/investments. Deduct a further $200 for impulse buys and assuming you put all of tis $1500 into investments (4.4% p.a. is the minimum you should be getting or youre doing it wrong)in 30 years it'll be in excess of $1m. A second property to rent is also well within reach.

Also, like what someone has mentioned in the comments, if youre not plannng to have kids a 3-room HDB is enough.

Just someone genuinely confused about how a combined income of $7k with no heavy medical bills cannot afford a HDB. The only reason I can see why is if you're renting your current home, which if you're a Singaporean, is frankly not a very wise thing to do unless you have reasons that most people do not have.

I never stopped loving her after she left and the breakup was too hard on me. I spent endless nights drowning my sorrows in whiskey hoping to get her out of my head but couldn't. The more I tried, the more I missed her. I even involved myself in a meaningless relationship with another girl ( Girl B ) because my friends suggested this would help me move on. That didn't turn out well because I was always bringing Girl A into our conversations and Girl B felt intimidated at times. Infact, even sleeping with Girl B didn't help because I woke up the next morning every single time and missed Girl A even more. It got to the point where I realized that this was no crazy infatuation that would die out in a couple of months as I expected. So I decided to end it with Girl B for good. I continued with my earlier lifestyle of drinking liquor with and drunk dialing her sometimes so that I could just hear her voice. Little by little, I tried surpressing my feelings for her and I was partly successful because I had cut down on my drinking even though I still missed her a lot. A few months later, she called me up out of the blue and we started catching up on lost time and decided to be friends again. We would call each other all the time and share every little detail about our day and it reminded of the time we were dating and just brought all those feelings back except this time I could see meet her often and listen to her soothing voice everyday. Until recently, when we had a fight over something stupid and I overreacted and since then, we haven't said a word to each other ever since. I want to apologise except I don't think she will forgive me because I was too harsh on her during my outburst which she didn't deserve. I still love her though and miss her dearly

My boyfriend and I will be going on exchange and while we'll be in the same country, we'll still be around 5 hours away from each other. We're considering embarking on an Open Relationship and allowing each other to explore and experiment with other people while overseas and I'm wondering if there's anything I should look out for that could potentially ruin our relationship. 

For more context, we're already in an Open Relationship here (we attend different unis). We actually do spend a lot of time together and like each other very much. We've got a strong relationship and vibe very well together, we just both like the idea of casual hook-ups a lot and didn't see why we needed to give it up just because we're officially attached (although we do intend to be exclusive at some point and have already begun to taper off the casual sex rather than just cutting it off completely so it becomes less sudden...) We don't have any problems with jealousy and are open with each other when it comes to discussing who we sleep with and how we feel.   

However, I'm also aware that having a long-distance open relationship has a vastly different dynamic from one where we see each other three times a week. And things could be potentially more dangerous overseas   (sorry if I'm being paranoid but sexual assault? college drinking gone wrong?? more STDs to pick up??). Have any other couples done this before? What happened in the end? Any problems to look out for? Any important questions to ask before we start on this?

607,"The one person I am with right now has been good to me. He’s stable, we don’t fight, he babies me and I guess I am happy. But I’m not sexually attracted to him. Maybe it’s just the kind of person I am; I want to enjoy youth, and go out with people. But because of the relationship, I am unable to go out and meet new people as there may be guys in them. Or go out drinking with male friends who ask me out. Of course, I love him. But more like a family or a close friend. And I have a feeling he loves me platonically as well because we haven’t been intimate for more than a year. Recently, it just feels like a waiting game. What’s the right thing to do? It would break my heart to leave him because he’s the best friend I have, but I know that I am not happy, at least in a way how a woman should be, in this relationship.

609,"OP of #72816

A big thanks to most of the people with genuine comments. Will probably decide whether I’m going to send her a text after exam week. 

The TL;DR version for the peeps that requested it:

A - childhood best friend 
B - girl of my dreams

A basically was the guy I would grow up with, staying in the same neighbourhood and going to same schools. He was a friend who you could have a good time with but he also had a bad side. I knew all his traits due to that, he was a jerk most of the time and would flirt with many girls due to him being blessed with good looks and confidence. Flirting was just a game to him and he would “do it for fun”. But he did the unthinkable by breaking the “bro code”. 

B was the first girl I ever talked to and would go on to build a very strong friendship, one which would eventually get me to catch feelings for her. However, I could never express it to her but I was content of having her as my “girl best friend”. A was very aware of my feelings for B as I would often share my thoughts about her to him. But instead, he would go on to hit her up on social media and flirt with her. I am not sure why he did that, perhaps it was another challenge for him to achieve or I don’t know what he was thinking. I asked him about it and he bluntly told me “he just needed her help on something”. 

Couple of weeks later A called me to ask if I would get angry if he somehow caught feelings for B, to which I replied that I definitely would. I was already suspicious of something happening between them at that point. Interesting enough, B suddenly asked for a quick meetup dinner the following week possibly to break the news to me. I met her and towards the end of the meal she asked if I was okay with them being together. Knowing A was a jerk and would be only hurting her along the way, I strongly disapproved but to no avail. Heartbroken, I said some hurtful words directed towards A and left. Since then I blocked them know since I didn’t want anything to do with A. 

It was been 5 years since that incident. It has broken me down completed to the point I started cutting out many other friends, as I just wanted to be isolated and not converse with other beings. I preoccupied myself with unhealthy ways to stop overthinking. I would still think about B from time to time as it was really hard to me to forget her. Recently started having dreams about B and I couldn’t help myself but to find a way to talk to B again. I can’t accept losing B in my life cause of actions caused by A. Till this day, I regret blocking B and losing her. So please, I need some advice on what I should do: 

1. Let things be as they are now?

2. What approach should I take to get B back in my life?

Thank you once again for taking the time to read!!

Recently there was this guy who made me very scared. Idk how to explain but I'll try. I mean he was quite nice and all and when I confide some of my weaknesses, he actually tried to encourage me not to feel that way. Talking to him for several nights feel very comfortable, very genuine and real. 

Then he asked for my instagram. And that's when I thought it would be the end of our convo, because quite a few guys stopped chatting with me after exchanging insta hahahahaahahah. But still I tried to gamble for another time and then surprisingly he still continues to talk to me??

And he also initiated giving me his number? Giving me a choice to contact him or not, instead of just pestering me for number? And so yes I gave him my number and we texted each other from good morning to good night :)

That's when the fear steps in. For someone like me who has no looks or talents or strengths hahah why would he do all these? Could he be having some other motives? Or is he just someone who is bored and wants someone to entertain him?

621,"OP of #72671 here, my girlfriend's the one with depression and anxiety.

So she decided to break up with me, despite me fighting hard to keep the RS going.
I'm still slowly trying to come to terms with this, and just need a space to let it out I guess.

My heart hurts. I loved you with everything, and tried to make life happier for you. I always told myself that I had to make you smile no matter what, when you were having one of those depresso moments. And i did. It always made me smile too.

I know you find it hard to deal with the fact that life together in the future is highly unlikely due to your condition, and also the more pressing factor of our families being of different religious backgrounds/race.

But I still love you, and you still love me. It hurts me to see that you've given up when I'm still fighting. But then again, I'm happy when you're happy. And I can understand why it might be easier for you to give up. It pains me to know that i can't be the person to comfort you whenever you feel down. It hurts me to know that we can't ever share the happiest experiences together again.

I cry whenever I see our photos together, when you and me were laughing and smiling. Why does life have to be so hard on interfaith/racial relationships when it comes to family? The depression just stacks on.

I can't find it in myself to give up on you. I don't know how to give up on you. I know you're still undecided on whether or not we could get back together as a couple because we still love each other, but you feel it's easier for you to break it off for now.
You cry whenever you see me cry, so I try to hide the sadness.

622,"Hi guys, really need your help here. I've been looking up integrated shield plans (health insurance) as I would like to insure myself against future hospitalisation bills. However, I've been diagnosed with Depression and many insurers will put me on hold because I've been hospitalised for it before. The previous medical bills came up to over 5k despite me staying in B2 and C class wards. This is after medisave and medishield deduction! It took me more than six months to pay them off. 

Its been about six months since I was last hospitalised. I've been told by certain insurers that I would probably need to wait two years after my last hospisation before my application for an IP plan would be approved. I'm now at a loss. My outpatient bills are also pilling up and I'm debating if I should just stop treatment altogether. 

Other than Mental illness, I've got O&G and skin issues as well. These appts are coming up but I'm planning to skip them because of mounting bills. They are not life threatening so I guess I'll just try to live with the discomfort until I figure something out. 

If anyone has any ideas regarding health insurance or a way to reduce my medical bills, I'd really appreciate it. Thank you for reading.

Yet for girls there’s no social pressure to keep up with appearance (hence average looking) and they have equal standing with guys unlike other countries. Its kinda optional to chip in to the family finance and they can happily buy their branded bags.

646,"I don't know what to do with my life. The post will be long, and please bear with me.

I have always been considered 'dumb' in Singapore's eyes. 

For PSLE, I was in the NA stream because my grades were horrible. Since then, my parents have always been disappointed in me because my brother was in the Express Stream.

Fast forward to N level, I got pretty good marks (13 points), but I could not make the cut of 12 points for the Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP). I could only go to Higher Nitec (ITE), but my mother was against it as she said that I would forever have a black mark on my education because I went to *ITE* (Boomer logic lol)

So she forced me to go for O level, where I failed badly, I got 32 points, and my Math was ungraded. I have always struggled with math, Chinese, and science. 

Even though my other subjects like humanities, English/Geography/Literature have always been in the As, but in Singapore's eyes, those subjects are irrelevant. Only Math/ Science is king. With 32 points and failing in math, I could not even make it to polytechnic. I had to go to ITE or retake O levels. I was feeling furious because if I had taken the higher nitec option, I would have gotten a chance to go to polytechnic. 

I wanted to retake O levels to get a chance to go to polytechnic. Once again, my mother came into the picture and put me in a private school to do International Baccalaureate. 

But since my O level results were so shit, they made me repeat Year 4 (or sec 4 basically) And once again at the end of the year, I could not cope because being in NA stream, I was never given a chance to do Additional Mathematics or Pure Sciences. However, in this school, I was forced to take Additional Mathematics, Pure Chemistry, and Pure Biology. If I was failing Mathematics and Combined Science, how can I deal with these subjects?

I was struggling badly, once again. I had never learned Additional Mathematics in my entire life nor taken any Pure Sciences, so most of the teachers were wondering why I was there, and some students kept saying how 'dumb' I was to be older than them, but not know these 'simple' subjects. The school wanted to kick me out because they said my results were so bad. My mother begged them to let me stay. So they did. 

Fast forward to after completing the IB, where I had JUST passed by the skin of my teeth with 26 points, IB is out of 45 points. The passing mark is 24. I could not make it to any local universities, plus I did not study Chinese or take Additional Mathematics for IB. 

Once again, my parents were disappointed because both of them are from NUS, and they always had high hopes for both of their children. My father regularly says what a disappointment I am and how embarrassed he is of me. 

He always compares me to his nieces and nephews, says how much smarter they are than me and how stupid I am.

I just wanted to stop studying and work. My mother told me I HAVE to go to university. Otherwise, I will die poor, and she will disown me because I am a failure.

I tried applying to 3 overseas universities, and I got rejected for everything except for one, which was Australia. I had high hopes for Canada as the course I wanted was Geography, but my parents said no because that course could not make money.

But the course (that my mother chose) was something I knew that I would struggle in. It's heavily Science and Mathematics based, and after many experiences, I know that I will most likely fail and struggle because these subjects are something I am not strong in.

The thing is, my mother has applied for everything and I will be leaving next year, but I do not want to. I know it will be challenging, and my parents told me I have to pay them back for every single cent spent. I did not even want to go to university in the first place, and now I have this burden placed on me. I'm scared, and I don't know what to do. 

I will be all alone in a foreign country, and I can predict that I will be struggling very hard. It's not that I'm lazy, please understand me. I am just not wired to understand Math/Sciences, but I am pretty strong in other aspects like English/Literature/Geography. To my parents, with a degree in any of these subjects, they are useless, and I will not be able to amount to anything in life. (According to them, that is.)

I'm just a little bit miserable, and I don't know what I want to do with my life. I'd instead choose to work than continuing to study.

Within these 2 months, I really tried my best to be a good boyfriend and to spend time with her, we even had plans to go overseas during this winter holiday break (she's not from NUS tho). But right now, in the midst of exams, I'm wondering if i really did the right thing by staying because I really don't feel that I love her anymore, and by staying I just feel that I'm cheating her of her feelings. And I really don't foresee a future with her in this country due to her family background and problems, mainly money wise.

What's even more fxxked up is that I've actually fallen for another girl, she really reminded me of my gf when I first met her, but she's cuter, smarter and definitely better-looking. She's has those attribute that I want to find in a gf/future wife. Tbh, I never thought that I would be in this position where I would fall for another girl while I am still in a r/s (this is my first r/s actually), and I’ve always thought “why would people cheat?”. But right now for me, I just don’t feel attracted to my gf anymore, and I would prefer to be single right now so that I can chase this new girl. (I don’t believe in dating more than 1 person at the same time)

So that’s my situation, please give me some advice on what I should do… I know somethings just aren’t meant to be in life, but I would feel bad either ways, if I break up or if I stay.

I've been with my boyfriend for coming to 10 years now. We are like best friends and lovers, absolutely in sync and seemingly all is good. 

However, I feel disloyal and need some genuine advice. 

At his family events, we would always meet this cousin of his - a few years younger than him and extremely attractive (my type)/also guy I would have gone for as well. And I do catch his cousin looking at me here and there and when we are left alone to speak, he seems shy/finds it hard to maintain eye contact and I feel such tension between us. He is currently studying overseas and I had mentioned only once of coming to the same location to study as well. However, he has been asking me when I'll be coming over/where and how soon, repeatedly. 

I shared this with my boyfriend to see if I'm reading into things, and he believed his cousin asks out of curiosity. He senses nothing and I dont say too much as well. But I just canttttt stooopp looking, imagining and thinking if his cousin is indeed interested in me and if/when I go over...

But of course this ends few days after the event as out of sight out of mind.

Am I overthinking? Am I being disloyal? Genuine advice guys! Thank you!

662,"I'm the OP of #72600 . I wanna thank you guys for the advice, feedback and comments. It really means something. Most of you guys mentioned that texting might be the issue, but that's not what I feel? If he wants his space, I would totally respect that, and I'm not one to double text often. I honestly feel like we don't text so much to the extent that he would need his space? He doesn't work much, so most of his time spent were mostly at home, family, and friends. 
So here's an update about what's going on. Feel free to skip if you are too lazy to read! 

He doesn't really enjoys talking about our personal stuff, and he claimed that he is lazy and said he would eventually tell me slowly and surely. He wants to take it slow and see how things goes instead of establishing any title or be in a committed relationship. I pestered him quite a bit to get him to talk about what's going on. He finally told me he isn't ready for a committed relationship, saying that he doesn't like the quarrels and argument that comes with it. I totally understand it and we have never quarreled before, as I don't like to find fault or confront a person directly unless I really need to. 

Also, I feel like he would not be emotionally available for me. That is fine to me as of now, I don't see it as a big issue as I also feel lazy to share about my personal life unless he asked. I just kept assuring him that its ok to be honest with me if I'm just an fwb, or if he isn't serious with me. I told him that I would rather he be 100% honest with me than to toy with my feelings or led me on. However, he kept reassuring me to trust him, that he isn't toying with me. He claims that he just wanted someone by his side. 

Whenever I tried to make plans with him, he seemed uninterested in carrying out and would come up with excuses. The only time he asked me out, was mostly to stayover. He told me he just enjoy chilling at home with me and watch shows, and that he feel that not having sex is fine. However, it still seems shady right? So now, am i safe to say that it's pretty obvious I probably meant nothing to him, and that he might really be toying with my feelings, and just treated me as an fwb? Or should I just trust him?

As we got closer with each other, we started acting more like couples - flirting, giving each other nicknames, going out more etc. We've gone out quite a few times and we we both said that we like each other a lot. He confessed to me, but I felt we both needed a bit more time and he was willing to wait. Can tell he really likes me and cares for me, from all the little actions he does, and he's a great person in many ways - good looks, intelligent, ambitious, and we share the same aspirations and values. 

But I have feelings for this other guy. This sounds kind of wrong but I've been secretly going out and getting close with this other guy (but technically we are just friends and friends can still go out). I realise this other guy makes my heart flutter more. I sometimes imagine us being together. He treats me very well too.

What should I do? 

I know the first guy and I are almost like couples, but technically I haven't accepted or rejected him yet so I don't think it's cheating if I go for the second guy? At the back of my mind I know I may regret losing the first guy. But what if the second guy is better?

675,"To OP #72798:

I actually have a differing view from most of the rest. You already mentioned that both of you have different personalities - you are extrovert and he is an introvert. Usually an introvert recharges by being alone, whereas you get more energised being around people. One of the common misunderstandings would be to think that there is a problem when an introvert keeps quiet. That is just the way they are.

Try approaching it from a point of view where you share about how you genuinely feel - that you are sharing your issues with him because you see a relationship as working things out in life together. I think what you shared here is very good and that it is something you should be speaking to him about (that you are confused, and would like to spend more time; and that you feel that if it is not fulfilled, you are worried about the relationship, but because it is important to you that is why you are speaking to him about it).

It is easy to give up, but every relationship will have its problems. It takes strong perseverance to work it out.

Just let me rant here. 

Sometimes i feel kind of tired of this relationship. My bf doesn't ask me anything, about my day, about my plans (whether I'm going out or anything), or what i am doing etc. Sometimes the whole day we would only converse not more than 5 lines, that wouldn't even be able to say it's 5 sentence. If i don't start a topic, he won't either. On those rare times when he text me first, i would be so happy. 

I spoke to him about it. He just say there's nothing special going on in his life. And next question i would think is 'then aren't you interested about my life? Or what am i thinking? Don't you want to know more about me, just like i would want to know everything about you.' Else, he would say that he isn't someone who is good at texting. Else, he would say that he is tired from work (which i can empathize to an extend). 

BUT when we meet in person, we are the other way round. He would be the one chatting more, while I'm usually the listener. He would fill me up on what he have been doing since we last met - sometimes in details, sometimes briefly. In person he is a bf that always make sure to send me home and is good to me and i alwayd enjoy being out with him. 

I thought to meet him more frequently, assuming that he is really not a good texter. But lifeshits makes us difficult to do so frequently.  The max was always twice in a week and it's difficult to do so every week. So it's kind of hard to test out this theory. 

Sorry for ranting so much. But in summary, girl is usually the one initiating convo in texts. Guy rarely starts convo. Guy reply girl but sometimes it's also a short reply which makes girl difficult to continue the convo. Girl can't do HTHT with guy frequently because guy thinks it's the girl thinking too much/being too emo and guy is uncomfortable expressing emotional stuff.

681,"*WARNING LONG POST AHEAD* 

This story involves 2 other people. For simplicity, I shall name them:

A - my childhood best friend
B - the love of my life 

I have known A almost my whole life, growing up in the same neighbourhood, going to the same primary, secondary & poly together. We would usually meet up most of the days since we only stayed 5 minutes apart. Be it for movies, meals, playing Basketball, hanging out at the park to talk about life etc. We were basically like siblings. He was blessed with good looks and I would always feel inferior to him. He could easily talk to girls as he was an extrovert, while I was completely the opposite. 

I met B when I was in secondary school, we met by an unusual situation whereby her best friend and my table partner had feelings for each other, so we would try to arrange for ways for them to meet after school. B was the first girl I ever talked to. We would then go on to be “text buddies” throughout our secondary life. I began to develop feelings for her along the way but never managed to express it due to the fear of rejection. She was the one girl I would talk to day & night, sharing our daily experiences with each other. Occasionally going out for movies and meals. We probably could have ended up together if I had a little bit of courage to ask her. (Bear in mind that I am the extreme case of an introvert, so it’s really difficult for me to express my feelings to others.) But I was contented with just being her friend at that point of time.

Time flew and we were eventually in poly, I was still in touch with B but our conversations would shorten due to being out of things to talk about. This is when things would start to get a little complicated. During my poly days, my friendship with A started to deteriorate as he decided to join the MLM craze happening at that time. He would occasionally ask me to join as he claimed that his company had good plans for high returns. My parents always told me to stay away from people like that and I would do so. But 1 day, I decided to just trust the friendship we forged over the years and had a go and invested in 1 of the plans he said was “fool proof”, hoping to get easy cash but just waiting out a couple of months. The time came when he promised me the returns would be delivered but of course, it never did. I decided to let it go by since he also invested in that scam scheme and continued my friendship with him, since he was also in the same boat. But of course, my friendship with him was not as solid as before, as I would decline to meet him as frequently as before. 

Soon after, A contacted B through social media and they started to chat. I was curious as to why A would suddenly want to talk to B, but I didn’t ask him about it cause he told me B was never his type since Secondary days. I decided not to bat an eye cause I wasn’t afraid of A ever liking B, since A knew how much B meant to me. At most, we could all become closer together and hang out even more right? Well, I was stupid to hope it was that case.

Fast forwarding a couple of weeks, A called me one night at asked “Hey if by some reason, I happen to catch feeling for B, will you get angry?” At that exact point I already knew, that he had feelings for her, if not why so would he even ask me that question? I of course responded with “Of course I will, you always knew my feelings towards her right?” He replied with “Yes of course. Alright see you soon.” 

I then saw through social media that they would “flirt” with each other through every tweet or post and began to think that they might actually already be together. But both A & B was reluctant to make it public as they were afraid it would hurt me. 

Following a few days, B suddenly asked me if I wanted to meet up and “catch up on life”. At that point I was sure that they were together and she wanted to break the news to be about them being together. I pretended not to know and proceeded anyway, hoping for a small miracle it wasn’t true and would favour me in some way. 

The day came when all hells would break loose for me. I met her at our usual meeting place and “caught up on life”, laughing and talking about the past incidents and the mutual TV shows we would watch. Towards the end of the meeting, I could sense she was a bit awkward, thinking of ways to break the news of them being together. Hence I just went ahead and decided to tell her, “Hey look, I know you and A are together...” She looked me in the eye for a few seconds, stunned and then proceeds to say, “Yes we are, I hope you understand and accept that. Hope it doesn’t affect our friendships.” 

Hearing those words, which I already knew to begin with, had affected me more that I thought it would. I was boiling with rage inside and in that heat of the moment, I said some terrible stuff like, “You know you aren’t going to last long with him right? He is a player and always plays with feelings. You are never going to be happy with him, and you can tell him that the friendship is over and he can go to hell. All the best to you anyway.” I immediately walked out of the restaurant after saying those words, without hearing what she had to say or what her reaction was, cause I was afraid I was only going to make matters worse if I stayed on. 

Once I reached home, I decided to block them both from all my social media’s since I didn’t even want to see A’s face. 

It was been a good 5 years since that incident. Recently I have been having dreams about B, all happy dreams such as us going out together, talking to each other again. I couldn’t help myself but to want to find a way to talk to B again. I can’t accept losing B in my life cause of actions done by A. Till this day, I regret blocking B and losing her. 

Oh and please note that A and B are not together anymore as I have mutual friends who would update me about B time to time. They broke up in that year they got together. I really miss B a lot, and am desperate to find a way back in her life. But I’m not sure if she will forgive me for what I did/said to her in our last meeting. 

So please, I need some advice on what I should do. Should I just let things be as they are now? If not, what should I do to get B back in my life?

Also, my love life was literally non-existent, all the girls that I liked never liked me back. Mind you, I was really trying my hardest to get a gf, but to no avail. Due to my image, I had zero self-esteem. I was very depressed and sad most of the time, and I just felt very empty and I just wanted to feel something. 

After army, I got into NUS Biz. I didn't get the chance to apply for FOPs so I had little to no friends in school. I tried signing up for Aphrodite lately but after getting both matches, they immediately ghosted me after seeing my profile picture, why do people always judge me by my looks first...

Last year, however, I met the girl of my dreams. I went for NUS Bizad Charity Run 2019 alone last year. I wanted to motivate myself to be healthier and also hope the I could meet some new people. During the run, I accidentally tripped and fell at the basketball court area. Even though it wasn't that serious, I was pretty shagged out from the run and laid there for a while. Suddenly, this really chio girl who was in the middle of running stopped and approached me, asking if I was okay. I was super shocked because I never thought someone like her would approach me.

She helped me up and kept asking if I was ok. I told her I was fine and that I could continue running and wanted to finish it. She then offered to run the rest of the route together and wahhh I was literally damn happy but tried to look calm. She was wearing a pair of light pink Nike shoes with the blue shirt. And not to be creepy or anything, but she smelt really good too. She was chatty and bubbly throughout the run, and we talked about life in NUS. She was also from Biz. Sadly, the run ended and she really made 5 km seem like 1 km. Even though we talked for a bit, my dumbass couldn't bring myself to ask for her name, and she didn't ask me for mine either. I have never been able to get her out of my head ever since, I really wish I can see her again.

He then proceeded to ask me how I would resolve the following conflict: "" You and your team members are working on a project that has a strict deadline but you found out that they were actually outcasting you for being tall and dismissing all your efforts for the team, using the excuse that your method doesnt work well for the project and how would you resolve that?"" . 

Of course, it took me quite a while to think of a solution to answer that but here comes another difficult question: "" Our door ceilings are not that high, will you mind bending your head often? We are afraid it will not be convenient for you...""

Has anyone here been through such similar situations? I really want this job because the pay prospects are kinda good....

Are those with prior programming experience spoiling the market? There should be a compulsory placement test like language mods to separate beginners from those doing the mod to get free As.

689,"I've been going for internship interviews even throughout this difficult period exams and all. There are bound to have some companies that require you to do some studying beforehand (for eg R&D) and they always like people who are independent. They don't like to ""spoon feed"" interns. If we are going to do everything by ourselves then what's the point in interning? They always make sound like we can churn out anything the company wants by ourselves. I'm really skeptical about internships and I don't really look forward to it... I hope to have at least proper guidance so I can really do what they expect me to do...

Also just to add... Why do NUS even offer companies to pay us a range of $800-$1000. Isn't it better to just start at $1000... Traveling across SG is very expensive and engineering companies are always at Jurong or jurong island or tuas... When I ask how much the pay is, companies will always say things like NUS recommends $800 and above so we are going to pay you $800. Of course everyone in the right mind would hire interns at the 'lower bound price'. Cheap labour to produce the work that their staff can do. So can't we just start at $1000...

So I’m still in Uni (Year 2) and he’s already working (just graduated from NUS). We used to hang out twice or thrice or even four to five times a week when we were both schooling but now I don’t even see him for two, sometimes three weeks. When I do, it’s sometimes only for ten to fifteen minutes when I visit him at home. When he first started working, we used to make the effort to meet for lunch or dinner often but now he's so busy with work (major events coming up) and I have exams and projects and I'm stressed and he's stressed and the distance makes me feel sad. Like I see the couples who crash each other's lectures or just hanging out 24/7 on Instastory and while that was never us, we led our own fairly separate lives because different schools, and the age gap but it still kinda makes me miss him. And I'm always so worried that he will meet someone else outside at work meanwhile I doubt I'll leave him for anyone in school because he's already TOP-tier husband material. 

I don't even let him pay, we still go Dutch and give and take during dates because I don't want him to feel like I am a burden. We also fight because I get jealous of him being so close to his colleagues (even his male ones). We also don’t have as much in common anymore, his problems are all so “adultish"" - he's even started talking about marriage and BTO and while I am excited by that prospect, I can't help but feel a little intimidated (I'm only 20!)I love him so much, what can I do to keep our relationship strong?

700,"My boyfriend (23M) and I (21F) have been going out for sometime and things are great. I've been with multiple guys in my life (sexually) and therefore have multiple experiences, whereas for him he has never been with any one sexually (although he is so hot). Anyway, I'll keep this short. 

So we both know what we like in sex; I am very submissive while he is very dominant. Once, when drunk, things got hot and we had a very very good time except that we couldn't fk properly because we were both too drunk. Well we finally tried to do it again once sober when things got hot and steamy again. 

I was mostly on top of him making most of the moves and I noticed from the very beginning already that he seemed to have not much clue as to what to do/ how to continue. It was a bit weird for me because I am not used to making almost all the moves and being on. top most of the time. But knowing that he might be worried about it as he doesn't have much experience, I just tried to keep things going and  kind of guide him at times. Then he began to do more and you know getting and top and all that but right before we were going to fk, I noticed he slowed down and there were moments he would just look at me for a really long time or look into space. 


Well, I started asking him if things were fine, etc but he just said things like yeah don't worry it's fine. But clearly there was something wrong because he continuedhaving this worried look. I slowed down and got up, looked him in the eyes and told him to not worry and that he can tell me anything. Finally, he told me that he was really worried that sex would turn out shitty, that he wouldn't be able to please me, thathe felt like a baby beside me because he didn't know what to do. 

I just tried to comfort him, telling him that it didn’t matter to me, to focus on himself, and that we can get better with practice. That the optimal sex between 2 different people is always different. However, no matter what I say, I can’t get him to stop worrying... 

Please guys, is there anything I can do/say to help him feel better? If you were in his position, what would help? Should I try to guide him more (initiate more)? Thanks in advance everyone. Will update. 

Tldr; great relationship but boyfriend worried to have sex with me because I have experience but he doesn’t.

704,"I need help to get along more with my parents. Long story ahead skip if uninterested! Background: my parents only speak Chinese and I usually converse in English with everyone else (including my siblings) since young so the only chance I have to speak Mandarin is with my parents, which is not often. Doesn’t help that I hated Chinese as a subject back in school so my conversational Chinese sucks despite having Chinese-speaking parents. I would often have to ask people to translate simple words because even though I can understand perfectly, when it comes to speaking, most of the time I translate from English in my head first. When I was younger, my parents would always leave my siblings and I alone at home and would rarely answer our questions (“children don’t need to know”, whenever we ask them what they did at work they would just brush us away). Now, all three of us siblings are quiet and introverted, though not sure if it was due to our upbringing but mehh. Our family was never close-knitted but got along with each others’ presence ok.

I was the middle child that always tried to spend time with them (compared to my siblings) and tried to converse with them whenever I could and helped out with their business. I was the “good child”, doing whatever they asked me to and never talked back to them. I also had relatively a lot of freedom in my life in a traditional Chinese family. But problems started when I was 18: they started to nag at me every single day, micro-managing my diet and whatever they say to me was “why are you like this? why are you not eating this? you are so dumb…” and they started to ask me where I was going and what I was doing. Compared to the past when they never gave a damn about my life (eg they forgot about my birthday once and they only remembered the next day and they never cared about my school results), I was very confused about the sudden nagging and criticisms that I guess I started to push them away and get annoyed at them. It got so bad that I never wanted to eat dinner at home because they would always criticise what and how I eat. They kept nitpicking at everything I do at the dinner table, especially when I had friends over they would nag and compare me with my friends, making us very uncomfortable. So, at 18-19yo I resented my parents. 

After the numerous times of replying to them in an annoyed tone, my mum gave me a talk about my behaviour and asked why I was doing this — and the problem was I was so bad at Chinese I just couldn’t explain it well. Also, my family doesn’t talk about this kind of stuff so it was very uncomfortable for me so I brushed them away. I guess as time went by, my Chinese became even worse in uni and my parents and I have nothing to talk about now. We literally have no common interests and we have A LOT of conflicting views on issues. Also, whenever I try to talk about my life or mention anything that troubles me in an attempt to make conversation, they would twist it against me and it’ll become a nagging session and I’ll regret even opening my mouth. 

I know my parents care for me a lot, and I care about them too. Just that it’s so difficult to be close to them and whenever I see people having close relationships with their parents, I envy them so much. How do you become close with parents whom you have nothing to talk about? 

ps. now I try to spend time with them going grocery shopping but they always try to rush through the shopping so it doesn’t help that much. also, going on holidays didn’t work too because we have different interests and wanted to do different things overseas.

717,"I have been holding this in for awhile. It’s up to you to believe the authenticity of this post. I know everyone has different perceptions of virginity. For me, I feel like my virginity has been robbed of me in clinical settings. When I had a bad tummy ache as a kid, my family doctor would conduct a rectal examination on me before prescription. I didn’t think much of it as a child. But it started to bother me when I grew older and had to visit the A&E or clinics to get my abdominal pain diagnosed. I always felt violated deep down but couldn’t mutter anything to anyone since it’s embarrassing and everyone just regarded it as a standard medical protocol to treat abdominal ache. As I ponder about this these days, it came to my realisation that prior to the conduct of the test, my permission was always not sought and the doctors always didn’t explain to me the rational clearly. I was somehow advised to bend over and do it. Maybe I was just too sick to think about it and wanted a treatment. It was so humiliating, as though my purity is stained. And you may say that I’m thinking too much. Years ago, when I had to undergo a medical check up for an employment role, I went through the examination again for unbeknownst reasons. Thinking back, I felt really foolish for giving in. 

As I researched on the topic recently, nowhere was it mentioned that the test is to be done to diagnose stomachache or food poisoning. It’s primarily used to screen prostate and belly cancer, or doesn’t it? Do the doctors conduct it because of protocols or pardon my insolence, out of personal fetish? There are quite a few articles that claim that the test is no longer necessary for such diagnosis, and it was used to humiliate homosexuals for committing same sex crimes. At the very least, the patients should be asked whether they want to do the test and doctors should not assume their consent. I won’t want to compare it to the grief resulted from real sexual abuse. But I don’t know why I feel that the humiliation still lingers even after my last encounter years ago. Maybe I’m an oversensitive coward. Thank you for hearing me out

https://www.facebook.com/593485004/posts/10162405250665005?d=n&sfns=mo

I’m not the OP of the post above but I’m sharing it as I felt that she made a really good point about entitled behaviours in public. Singapore’s moral education is effective in the sense that the general public has the sense of filial piety towards older people, respect your elders and what not. 

Because of this, we learn to give way to old people and we tend to let them do whatever they want, like letting them get in front of the queue for the bus or give up seats for them whether or not they asked for it. I think this has fostered a sense of entitlement for the older/boomer generation that they are now part of the “upper class” of society. 

I think I speak for all of millennials when I say 99% of us has encountered at least one selfish older generation individual in our lifetime. Just a few weeks ago I got told off by an old lady for sitting on a non reserved seat on the train, funny thing is that she was already on a reserved seat herself & it was a relatively empty train with no one who needed the seat. Her reasoning was “young people are entitled and should not sit on the train”. 

Of course not all the older gen are like that. Sometimes when I do something as simple as holding the door for an auntie carrying her ntuc bags she would smile and say “thank you ah boy”. On the other occasion when I give up my seat for the old lady she made the tsk sound while trying to squeeze into the seat and quickly sat down without looking at me and played Pokémon Go on her phone. So I think this post above was a really good example of how selfish individuals look like and we should not give way to them just because of their age. Respect should be earned not given. 

This is solely my opinion, please don’t flame me with personal attacks and this is an Nus based forum so let’s be civilised in the discussions

I have stuck with her throughout the 4 months persistently and she says im stupid for doing so, since most people would cut and run.
But it has come to a point where it's tiring to do so. 
Im tired. 
Tired of fighting so hard for someone who doesnt fight as hard for me.

I think i'm selfish for thinking that way. She's going through depression and yet here I am expecting her to put in effort into the relationship. 
I didnt bring this issue of me feeling like I wasnt getting anything out of the RS up to her for a couple of months because i knew she was going through stuff and I didnt want to add on to her burden.

I did my research online and understand that it's normal for people undergoing depression to feel this way sometimes. But it's hard to hold on to a relationship when the other party insists on breaking it off. And even harder when the reason behind it is because she thinks she cant provide me with the things a girlfriend provides because she has depression.


Recently she asked me why i wasnt sharing stuff with her, because i'd want her to share her problems with me, so we could work through it together.
So I finally did. I brought up the issue of me feeling like I wasnt getting anything out of the RS gently, but also didnt tell her because i knew she was going through stuff and I didnt want to add on to her burden.

And she broke down. Went back into this loop of wanting me to dump her. Either that or she would dump me.
I dont know why i'm still fighting so hard for her. Am i dumb to do so? 

I did insist on bringing her to see a counsellor recently after a recent severe suicidal episode.
All i want is for her to be happy again.
But a part of me is feeling really really tired at having to deal with all of this everytime. I tried so hard yet I feel i'm stuck at this same spot with her.

One of R’s close girl friends even began to spread rumours about me trying to be a third party in R’s relationship and that i am overrated in school.

I wish all these rumours would stop because 
1. my close friend is already very upset about R dating someone else, and then finding out he likes me..
2. I like this guy a lot but these rumours are jeopardising my chances with him. 

I am not sure how to tell R to stop without coming off as mean and arrogant, and ruining his relationship with his current girl.  I do not know how to face my close friend because of this, she stopped texting me. i do not know if i should apologise for all of this even though it is not really my fault.

727,"My boyfriend and i have been in a stable relationship for two years, recently he entered the same university as me (i am year 3, he’s a year one), and is close to many girls in his hall. Not that i have a problem with that but i found out that he discusses our sex life with one of his girl friends. Recently, i scrolled through his dms (we have access to each other’s acc since forever), and i found out that that girl friend of his sent him a post of a girl covered in hickies. He then replied “just saw, wtf insane sia”

Not sure if this is already a red light in the relationship? She sends him girls who show cleavage and ass as well(she shows a lot of cleavage).. when confronted, he denies and says that they’re only friends. The horny sending of posts continues till today. They also send each other explicit sex position stickers on telegram.. To make matters worse, 5 months ago, I decided to stop having sex with him because i wanted our relationship to be build on passion before anything sexual. He talks about her all the time like how he’s worried for her studies and how she spends a lot of time clubbing and going on dating apps. But when i do badly for a test, he doesn’t even express concern.

Is this because we are already too comfortable with each other? I trust him but i think sending explicit post on instagram to his girl friend is ridiculous. He also does not see the logic behind where I’m coming from. Not sure if it is because he needed to satisfy his sexual needs that I no longer provide? Isit normal for a taken guy to send explicit things to his close girl friend?

728,"Dear Prof Ben,

Being an algorithm Engineer dealing with deep learning in a young start up (less than 5 years, with 400 million users) vs being a web developer in a big company (e-commerce), which one do you think is better in the long run? 

The pay and benefits of the start up is worse than the big company but I am worry I might be left out of the AI trend and become irrelevant in the future if I choose the big company instead of the start up.

Most people advised me to take the offer I am most excited about, but I find both of them equally exciting. I would love to hear some advice from you. 

Thanks in advance.

731,"I'm attracted to a guy who is about 7 years younger than me. It started with a crush which I didn't really bother much initially. Since we see each other pretty often (due to work), my feelings towards him have been growing stronger these days. We text each other almost every day, about random thoughts and events. Most of the time he does not reply to my messages immediately maybe because he is busy with work. But whenever he gets a chance, he'd reply to every single message I've left with really long 'essays'. And it has always been me who texts him first. He is genuine, empathetic, sensitive and caring. He's generally shy and sometimes I feel this awkwardness between us. I wondered if he likes me or at least has some feelings about me too. So I sent some signals such as really light flirt messages and giving him gifts. But he didn't reciprocate to any of those. Eventually, I asked him for a movie. I could see that he put in some effort into dressing up and getting hair done. And he did look cute that day. Anyway, we just watched a movie. Nothing happened. After the movie, we walked along and chatted a bit on the way to the bus stop. And we went home separately. I really enjoy talking with him despite occasional awkward silence between us. And he doesn't seem to dislike me. Sometimes I feel frustrated because he took like one day to reply to me. And I was telling myself okay I'll cool down a bit and try to put everything behind. Then soon after I see him again, the desire of getting closer to him and more connections with him is back again. This has been really torturing for me. Due to the nature of work, we still have to see each other like 3-5 times a week. I'd like to seek for some advice here.  I really like him. What should I do? I'm not sure if he likes me? After so many tries on my side and no response from him, maybe I should take it as a no? Or should I be honest with him? But tbh, I have not thought about the realistic future between us such as age difference, different education background, family, and maybe income etc.? All these do not matter to me that much when it comes to a person's characters and virtues. But maybe he is concerned about those? What should I do?

734,"Hi everyone, OP of #72358 here. I've read all of your comments on my original post and am really grateful for the support from this community. Long read ahead.

Just recently things got worse again. Short backstory is that we will be attending a semi formal gathering with many others with banquet dinner and some senior staff involved with performances as well. The dress code is not stated clearly but hearing from other friends who will be attending, many are not wearing formal suits and just wearing button up shirts and formal pants.

As someone who does not like to dress up so nicely as my mentality was that fashion was never a major concern for me growing up, I felt that wearing a collared button up shirt and formal pants was sufficient enough. However, my girlfriend felt otherwise.

She has known that i am really not the type to dress up, all be it that i do dress up nicely when during the appropriate times such as going to a nice restaurant for our anniversary or to a wedding dinner. My schedule had finally cleared up for me to have more free time in the past week and she began asking me what i would wear to the event. She initially suggested for me to wear a suit and a bowtie to match colours with her dress to be cute couple matching kind of thing. I told her as kindly possible that i preferred to wear my original outfit as money is tight for me now while looking for a part time job, but would be open to match colours if i could find the same shirt with the same colour as her dress.

I believe that i was firm with my decision the first time she asked me about it, but i was asked several more times in the past few days about taking on her offer about wearing a bowtie or get a blazer. After telling her that her pestering was getting slightly repetitive since i had told her the same response each time she asked, she took offense to my response and got upset at me quite badly. She ended up sending me a whole string of messages (about 10-15?) but shortly deleted them afterwards and ghosted me until the afternoon of the next day (this took place around night time).

This wasn't the first time this had happened. I couldn't catch all that she wrote as i was away from my phone but caught slight glimpses of what she wrote in some messages. Some of them included ""goodnight this is what we've become i guess"" and ""Sometimes i dont get why its so difficult for you to do (this and that)"". I could get the vibe that she said all of that in the moment, but she had told me previously that when she's drunk or angry her filter goes off and she really tells the truth. Its happened before but this time felt worse than all the others.

The whole commotion ended with me agreeing to her request and got a blazer that matched her dress colour, which further worsened my financial situation now which she knows isn’t doing that good and i could do with saving cash and not spending it on certain unnecessary items. I crumbled under her pressure and gave in.

Side tracking for a bit, a family friend of mine recently passed away by suicide and i told my gf about it and how my family has been affected especially my mum who has teared up at random times just thinking of what happened. I've told her to really stop with the suicide threats and saying about suicide so openly as i believe those who truly feel suicidal tend to not show signs of it, yet she has still continued with the recent meltdown leading up the deleted messages part.

Back to the main topic, I feel that our relationship has been over for a while, but neither of us has taken the step forward to end it properly. From my perspective, it feels as if she would be better off as a person without me. She had previously told me that she would not leave me because she believed that people usually find their soul mate, and she could not understand how people could date more than one person after breaking up with their previous partner/s.

I have suggested taking a break from each other for us to grow and mature, to learn from our mistakes and become better persons for each other. She shot the idea down and said that it was either we were with each other or not at all. I think it is time for me to take the first step for what needs to be done for the better of her and the both of us.

And if you are reading this L, I’m sorry for our lows but thankful for sharing the moments we had with each other, you’ve taught me how to love someone other than my family more than i could ever have. I love you, but it is time for us to be apart and mature for the better of each other and our future partners.

737,"Hi, after reading many of the responses to #72599, i find that some responses are rather unfair. For example, Exhibit A says ""If he doesn't want to sleep in the same room as him means he doesn't want to spend time with you after a long day"", or Exhibit B says ""Has his own room means he can bring company over *wink face*""

Personally i feel that having your own room separate from your partner's is completely fine, especially if its a mutual agreement between both parties. As an introvert myself, i find social gatherings and interacting with many people during my day can be really exhausting and at the end of the day i may want to just be by myself with no noise, no distraction and just time for myself to recharge and regain the energy.

To add on, partners may have different work schedules or personal schedules. Let's say husband wakes up at 6am to go to work but the wife wakes up at 9am. Husband goes to sleep at 11pm but wife stays up later and only goes to bed at 1am. Such different timings can result in clashing of sleep schedules and may disturb the other party.

I saw a recent post on reddit with many people responding to why they and their spouse had chosen to sleep in separate bedrooms. If any of you are interested its here: https://tinyurl.com/y4dmva5x

All this being said, a relationship works both ways. To OP of #75299, talking to your partner and be open to the idea of sleeping in separate bedrooms. I'm sure the lack of time together at night will be surely made up when both you of are together at other times :)

743,"TLDR: My best friend is a chronic latecomer and it's really frustrating. 

This is going to be pretty ranty but some advice would be nice too! My best friend (all the way from secondary school, through poly, NS and now uni) is consistently late. Not just 15-20 minutes late but 2-3 hours late. 

In our poly days, we'd study together at my place and he would agree to show up at 10 am but arrive at 2-3 pm because he  ""overslept"" or some equally inane reason. 

When I brought this up to him, he says I'm being unreasonable because no one else has ever given him grief for it. In NS, he was a stayout Pes E Clerk and was still consistently late for it but his superiors never said anything. When he was interning (at a very prestigious company, mind you), he was still late every day with no one saying anything. He’s late to every major social gathering too.  I seriously don’t understand how he has gotten away with it so far. His reasoning if that if his boss, enciks, parents and other friends have no problem with it, he doesn’t understand why I do.

He’s also late for major events - he missed my poly graduation, he was 2 hours late to his own award ceremony, he was also one of the last few to show up at my birthday party despite agreeing to come 2 hours earlier to help me decorate. The list goes on. I guess I’m feeling the pinch of it more now in Uni because we tend to meet outside or in school now and waiting around outside for two hours is infinitely worse than chilling at home for four. I’ve always told him that I hate this late-coming thing but I’ve only started getting more aggressive about it in the past year because I’m seriously super sick of it. Treating me like my time is worthless is one thing but how is that going to affect other people’s impression of him?

Again, when‌ I told him nicely that he needs to stop doing this because it’s rude and he needs to start valuing my time and that the whole world shouldn’t revolve around him, his response is that my time matters less because he’s in Computing and I’m in Arts (seriously?? I love being in Arts btw so that’s not even an insult) and started going into a personal attack, telling me that I’m having relationship problems with my other half because I’m “unreasonable” and “have communication issues”. That was really hurtful. I’ve been nothing but calm and compromising and even he admitted that “it was a personal attack to get you to shut up”!

I’ve been putting up with this for 5-6 years now and it’s really, really frustrating.  He tried to pass it off as “startup culture” at some point but I don’t buy it lol. I guess I’m posting this as a rant but for reals though, what should I‌ do? Is there anything I can even do?

Seriously super hurt right now.

He also says that 2 people sleeping on the same bed can be uncomfortable and squeezy and if one person snores or make noise, it will affect the other person.

So basically i feel she's kinda like wife material but damn hot kind. After chatting for a few days i initiated texting exclusively and she agreed. In the next few days, we talked about what we do to our families to our career plans and ideal family life. Our convos were also punctuated with quite abit of sexual tension. We would often refer to each other as bb, baby or babe and often drop miss you or love you msgs. 

In a week's time i asked her out for our first date and she suggested that I pop by her place. Well I am completely open with fwb ish rs and is in fact extremely excited that she is the other party. A part of me was planning to start out as fwbs and get the girl eventually - cause hot wife material damn. We made plans to meet and we both expressed how much we cant wait to be in each other's arms. 

The following day, however, she just completely deleted our chat and when I tried checking up her handle again I think she blocked me. 

Can someone tell me whats going on here? I am honestly feeling abit hurt cause our convos were really good - like both meaningfully good and fwb ish good. But at the same time im familiar with how im supposed to feel with regards to fwb ish rs. What is she doing/feeling all these while also? And what does that last move mean?? Maybe she had some emergency/unforseen circumstance that led to this sudden cutoff?? Or was i too agressive/desperate in showing my keeness that i scared her off?? Did we progress too quickly?? Am i feeling too much about a rs that was possibly more fwb ish??

752,"Hi, I am evergreen and never had a girlfriend before. Before coming to NUS, I was from a predominantly male school so I have very few contact with girls. I have no female friends as well. Now, I am trying to find a girlfriend but I find the prospect of talking to a girl and hanging out one to one with her very stressful. I tried tinder before and went on a few tinder dates but I personally found those to be very very stressful. Before the date, I have to dress well (I usually wear T-shirt and shorts when I go out with my male friends), do my hair, put on contacts and shave. As such, when I go out with such attire, I feel very self conscious and not like myself. I feel like the whole world is staring at me and judging me, thinking why the hell is he dressed like that for? On the date itself, I would feel very stressed up trying to keep the conversation going and making sure I do not say anything that might potentially offend her or make her think I am a lowly creep. I tried getting a girlfriend in NUS but whenever I am in a one to one situation with my fellow female coursemate, I would feel very stressed up trying to keep the conversation going and making sure I don’t come across as weird and creepy. At times I would just feel like breaking down mentally and running away. Thus, I avoid asking them out even on casual lunches. Just asking them for lunch is stressful and I fear what they might think my intentions might be, which is why I procrastinate a lot before I actually do ask them out. I never had this problem with guys as I feel that they are less judgmental and more accepting of me. Compared to girls, I feel at ease around them and am able to say and do what I want freely without fear of social repercussions. Thus, til now, I never had a female friend, much less a girlfriend. But sometimes when I see pretty girls around campus, I really wish I had a girlfriend, although the prospect of dating seems very daunting. Even my coursework feels 1000x easier compared to this. What should I do?

I keep feeling that I am suffering from height deficit (Even though I am of the so-called ""average"" height of male in Singapore that is stated in Google). This is supported by my observations of not just guys in NUS, but girls as well. What I observed is in general, the guys are at least half a head taller than that. Even the shortest gal is at least that height (Biz, Arts , Medicine) faculty. If you are my pathetic height, there is truly no way you can feel tall if you project your vision straight from your eyes?

770,"Can someone advise? I just ended a big group project for a module which i actually thought i would enjoy at the start. However, because of one particular groupmate (let's call him M), i felt very very suffocated throughout the project. 

So let's say we have 4 components to the project - after finishing our respective components, M would just quietly make modifications to our components without letting us know or explaining why he's making the modification(s) as he deems. Only when confronted would he explain his rationale for his thought process, but despite arguing that i'm also correct, he would insist that he is correct and im wrong and honestly at that stage i simply choose to give up arguing with him because it's very mentally draining and i just accept his argument.

Not only that but when it comes to presentation, he would also want to control the way that we speak, the choice of words we use despite things being an informal presentation. While i can understand where he is coming from in his actions and i commend his level of effort that he is putting in, i personally feel that it becomes very mentally exhausting when I'm being microed and controlled so hard. 

I'm honestly not saying M is at fault or anything here, in fact i really respect his level of effort that was put into the project but i think somewhere along that level of effort some other things get lost. Is the journey of getting grades and marks so important that the fun of learning gets sacrificed along the way? i mean i personally enjoyed working on my own component and being in charge of it but when i get microed so hard by my groupmate it honestly becomes a very draining process. i just don't know what to feel, like does anyone else feel this way or has anyone ever encountered such situations before? Please help me to keep my emotions in check :(

My ex from poly had maybe just 1 or 2 female friends, the rest were all guys. She gave the famous excuse: because girls are catty and guys are less drama...

The problem with this is that she literally had guys in the friendzone revolving around her waiting for me to screw up so they could strike and get closer to her. I feel that she only kept some of them around for validation or future potential in case things didn't work out, idk. When we had our quarrels she would of course get 'support' from some guy friend because there were no girl friends to share 'relationship stories' with

We're totally in sync and have our whole lives planned out together and as a bonus, he does romantic stuff like buy expensive gifts and plays my favourite songs on the piano. I could go on and on about how amazing he is but essentially: TLDR, he's awesome. 

The biggest thing is that even after I cheated (sort of) and that went horribly wrong, he still took care of me, brought me to the doctor and all - no judgement. And then a week later, I broke up with him over something completely irrelevant and trivial because I'm a dumbass. 

I know, I know, I'm extremely stupid for letting something this great go. I guess my question is: how should I make it up to him? Even showing up at his place to grovel for his forgiveness doesn't feel enough. What do men want? Chocolate? Flowers?? Clothes?? Video games????

During my undergraduate years, I wasn’t really close to any of my professors and didn’t establish a close enough relationship, something which I am currently regretting.

Honesty can't get you anywhere only being taken advantage of more easily. My friend could have told his gf on the phone ""oh I'm gonna hang up cos i wanna play my game"" what would the gf have done? Join in? What if the game is single player? Stop him? 
How about ""oh I'm sorry i forgot to do my part in the project"" what would the team members have said? Toxic members would be ""what the f*ck gave u one job and you can't do it right"" or some members that would simply be pissed would think, or tell others how useless his/her teammate is. 
Why be honest here when all it does is to make others see how selfish or how useless you are when probably all you wanted was a me time or that you are helpless with memorising even with various methods of reminders?
Others that would've known your intentions in doing something would convince you with their own reasoning to stop you from doing that ""something"" also somehow guilt tripping you which is why i said being honest makes you vulnerable to being taken advantage of.

Who would offer another chance when you didn't have a valid reason yet you are honest with them? Others would probably feel that honesty should be part of the ""good"" side where you should be apologetic, learning from your mistakes and not desiring for things like a second chance.

I graduated with a degree from NUS because getting a degree is what I did want to achieve. However, I am pretty skilled in design work (which has nothing much to do with my FASS degree) and decided to continue working in this area freelance. (I have been doing freelance designing while studying anyways and I have established a decent portfolio.)
I graduated last year and has been doing freelance designing work for about 1 year, full time. I am planning to continue with this “career lifestyle” in the long run. I go on a short term contract basis or project base work and I get a decent average pay of 3k plus/minus monthly. 
Many have advised me to “look for a job” so that I can “gain exposure” etc. I get where they are coming from, but I am really satisfied with my status quo, and, I believe that, with my portfolio, if I were to want to switch to a full-time job, it is still possible.

785,"In response to OP #72365

I quite agree with you. However, the issue for me isn’t whether the commenters are NUS students or not, but it’s about the type of comments left on each confession. Granted, some of the confession appears to be troll posts, but even then, does it really entail the need for the public – anybody, really – to leave such negative and distasteful replies?

From my observation, the ugliest comments are often written by those who have morally disengaged, and thus rationalised their hurtful and malicious comments as words of wisdom or blunt advice, from the “necessary evil” standpoint. Yet, their behaviour is in fact more self-serving and overly self-righteous. My best guess is that they probably derive satisfaction from the thought of posting an ‘educated’ response, made worse by the thought of it being watched by bajillions of people on the internet.

Anyway, to cut to the chase, when it comes to malicious comments to confessions that are more serious and sensitive in nature (e.g. those concerning mental health), I’ve sent out emails to the respective organisations that the commenters belong to, be it commercial companies or educational institutes. And that’s probably why you see some commenters disappearing from the forum. *winks*

Last but not least, the “top fan” badge doesn’t value-add to the quality of your comment/advice. It only means that you’ve been surfing the NUSWhispers page for far too long. But what you can really do as a true top fan is to keep others in check, and prevent them from attacking or bullying others with hurtful replies. :)

Thanks for reading! 
Peace out.

787,"Hi prof Ben/everyone, 

I need some serious advice/perspective to help me with this emotional issue of mine that has been bugging me for years.
My relationship with my parents, my mom especially, is estranged. 
And I would like to have some opinions on how I feel, and hopefully improve things (?).

Ever since young I’ve always felt like no matter what I did and how much effort I put into something, I’m never and never will be enough for them.
To my mom, I’m a loser, I can’t study well, I can’t make money to support myself properly Nor even give her monthly income (as oppose to what she did for my grandma when’s she’s my age - 24).

I wouldn’t say I hate them but I feel so gutted and angered that they were never really there for me, Nor support my goals as their child. To them I’m just a retirement plan in the future, but right now, a free loader living in their space, drinking their water and “taking money” off of them (which comes close to almost zero, less electricity bills?).
They say I’m not contributing to the family and I’m always closed off to myself and selfish.. but I’m truly just emotionally drained.

They were never there for graduations, army POP etc and other larger life events. No birthdays, no celebrations Nor verbal affirmations or even just a simple “I’m proud of you”. All along it’s only harsh remarks about how selfish I am, about how I’m a bad Son and I wouldn’t amount to anything.

I’ve been working since sec sch for pocket money, I paid for my poly fees, and now uni fees and all of my living expenses. Not gonna lie, it’s so so tough to manage a full time job and doing part time classes at night on top of chores at home. I’ve not been doing well for school, and full time job has taken a toll on my studies, I’ve delayed 2 semesters now.. on top of that, I worked for a year after NS to save up $. (I feel like I’m losing out so much to my peers who seems to be doing so well. My female friends have already graduated and the guys, soon to graduate and yet I’m stuck neither here Nor there.)

I feel so anguished - physically and emotionally. I feel like quitting life.

I just wished that they’d see that their Son is working hard and not a lazy bum. At the same time, I need some trust and investment from them to make life a little easier. 
They’re really traditional parents that sees the only way for success is having a degree first and working in the STEM industry. None of those are my passion Nor what I’m good at. 
It’s so hard to fight back and be successful, I wish I have more time and energy to go for more courses and defeat the rat race too. (But it’s so difficult to change the course of my life at this point in time, I need resources that I don’t have.) 

Guys, am I right to be angry at them? I don’t even want to be angry at them.. but I’m so exhausted and tired of these set of cards that’s thrown at me. 

If there’s any advice or opinions on what should I do to better support myself and change my circumstances, please let me know and I’ll do anything.

I look forward to your perspectives. 
Please help me,

Exhausted Son.

792,"How do you deal with annoying family members whom you almost lose respect to already?
I have immediate relatives whom I visit weekly. It is getting annoying recently. A few examples here. 

Examples 1: A convo with an elderly relative 
Context: I broke up with my ex (ITE background, doing general job) a few months back and recently got together with my current boyfriend (uni grad, civil service job). FYI: He has never met both of them but probably only heard stuff from members of my family. 
Female Relative: (Upon knowing that I have broken up with ex) Good. It’s good you broke up with him. He is not good for you. 
Me: (In my mind) Erm…seriously? How can you judge a person 
Me: (IRL) just look at him blankly, but didn’t give a reply. 
Out of “respect” just because he is elder, and base on my experience in knowing that he will obviously be stubborn in her own stance, I just cannot be bothered explaining to him, because it will probably just lead to a futile “argument” which ends of with me the younger one being labelled as “disrespectful” etc. My respect for him totally just dropped to ground zero. 

Example 2: Cousin of mine
Context: So, my bf works in a pretty high end role, well paid.
Cousin: So, you believe what he says? What if he is lying to you? 
Me: (In my mind) Seriously, that is so little faith you have in me? To me, that is very insulting. 
Me: (IRL) Yes, I have seen his staff pass and met his colleagues. Why would he lie about such things? 
Again, this type of people makes me want to role my eyes. 

However, unfortunately, due to family gatherings and stuff, I can’t just blatantly say I hate these people and avoid them. Now, I just chose to keep quiet and not say anything whenever I meet these people because they really have low sense in their judgements of people. I wouldn’t want to share something and them cause them to hold my words for it or use it against me. 
Shouldn’t they get to know a person properly before passing judgements? Why do people behave like this? What should I do?
I secretly lose my respect for them, but I do not show my distaste out in public to avoid conflict. I just don’t chum up to them and keep my distance physically and keep convos with them to the minimum.

I would call him A. He always dresses up really pretty and loves the colour pink. At one time, I almost disregarded everything around me and went ahead, despite knowing he was born with Squidward's masterpiece. It was fortunate that my decades of experience pulled me out of that situation. However, after that incident, there is this emptiness within me but every girl I've met does not give me the same level of affection that I have experienced from my previous waif. It has come to a point where every 3 months, I find a new person I really like and I have become addicted to this. As a guy, it is natural to be attracted to one of the opposite gender. 

However, as a man, one must be firm and commit to a relationship that you have promised to. Even if polygamy is practised (which it isn’t), you must take your partner’s feelings into consideration. Ignore those hypocrites who tell you that you can have multiple waifus. Choose well and with conviction, then stand firm by it. Those hypocrites will be the ones who will have trouble sticking with a particular choice. There is only one ground rule in this game of life: as long as they are not blood-related, they are free to be dated.

Currently, nearing the end of my exchange semester at NUS, I am reflecting on my experiences over here. My overall experience here in Singapore has been very positive. I had to chance of meeting many amazing people along the journey and toured lots of places in Southeast Asia. So it's safe to say I really don't have any regrets. 
One thing that caught my notice was that most local students are very shy when it comes to engaging in a conversation with me. My guess is maybe it could be the unfamiliarity with my accent? As a result, I spent most of my leisure time here hanging out with other exchangers. Don't get me wrong, I still had plenty of fun. But sometimes I do wish for an opportunity to sit down with a local student, drink a few beers, and engage in a deep conversation. Not sure about others, but I'm actually really interested in learning more about Singaporean culture from an insider's point of view. What are some tips to better interact with locals?

I don't know if he is immature or just insecure.. but deep down I feel that he is a good guy.

And i'll start reading too much into his every action and thinking that the feelings are mutual but it almost always turns out to not be true. After which i will then proceed on to liking some other guy again like the next day or smth. Idk am i just despo to have that feeling of being loved and being in a relationship? i don't even know if these are counted as having a crush bcos how can a crush change so quickly?

804,"This semester is the first one my boyfriend and I are spending apart on exchange on different continents. It wasn’t easy coping with the loneliness and unfamiliar environment but luckily the seniors at my student residence were friendly and helpful. We attended many activities and toured around the continent together. Over this time, I gradually grew closer to this local senior and we started going on trips with just two of us only. In my emotionally needy moments, the senior was there for me while my boyfriend couldn’t due to the time difference. 

Things happened, and I just discovered I am pregnant. Abortion is definitely out of the question as I am uninsured and the abortion bill will be sky high, not to mention the general unavailability of abortion services here. But I also don’t want to go back to NUS preggers as my boyfriend will surely know that it’s not his. I also don’t want to kill my own child and part of me is genuinely curious how a mixed race child of mine is going to look like. Marrying the local senior isn’t an option because while he is fun to date and good between the sheets, he isn’t the stable kind of guy good for bringing up a family (unlike my boyfriend).

How now? Should I try to extend my exchange or take a leave of absence and give up the baby for adoption here?

808,"My gf and i have been together for close to 2 years. We started out as a pretty normal relationship, honeymoon phase the first 8 months then after this year started everything went haywire.

Since the start of this year she began behaving differently. I showed care and concern when she was at her lows but she still said that she didn't feel like i cared about her. She made demeaning remarks about herself which hurt me as well, i told her to stop saying those things but she never did. She made suicide threats and often said things like ""i should just go hang myself or jump off a building"", when she knows that i know people who have been in that situation but worse and it affects me closely. She had never trusted me with any of my friends of the opposite gender even after i made it official to everyone that we were together and distanced myself from other girls, even up to now. She didn't even trust her good friend from the same church to not try anything with me.

She started saying that i don't care for her at all, that no one gets her and that she is just a lonely person. I've been ready at my phone to listen to her and give her advice from her rants and be there for her, on some nights when she returns home late i ask that she send me a text to let me know that she's reached home safely. She still thinks i don't care for her. When i try to give advice i usually use my logic and common sense to give the best advice i can, yet it always seems to end up with her saying that i don't understand her at all.

Recently she also started talking about marriage, i told her that we should focus on our studies for now and think about it only when we are at a suitable age and can be financially independent. I was bombarded with questions of my commitment to her and whether i truly loved her.

What am i doing wrong? I know I don't express my emotions well similar to my family and my gf knows that side of me, she has a low self-esteem and this is the first serious relationship shes been in before. The only idea of how relationship works is from dramas which i've told her many times most dramas dont depict a true image of how a relationship works.

I'm tired of all this and I don't know if she will change. What do i do?

He then revealed that his initial motive was s*x/fwb. While leading me on the whole time flirting and hinting he is interested in me. I felt really crushed and disappointed as I genuinely thought there could be something between me and him. I then told him we could maybe just go on texting and perhaps develop emotional feelings in the future and he agreed. He was still really thoughtful and also agreed to not ask for fwb anymore. We texted for abit more and suddenly he changed his mind and became really cold and distant. He said we wanted 2 different things and that we can never be together. What did i do wrong to deserve this... I really wanted both of us to work out but he just decided to cut me off and leave. It took me so much courage to tell him goodbye and not text anymore but i still find myself looking at his last seen often, cant help but to think that he found a replacement. Please advise.

811,"Hey guys, I am very confused by this guy's behaviour and need a different perspective.

I have a guy friend and we often go out to dinner together as friends. But everytime it comes time to pay, he doesn't allow me to pay even though I insisted on paying half. When I said I would pay for the next meal, he says no. His reasoning is that he earns more than me, therefore he should foot the bill while I should save for a rainy day. I really don't want to be a freeloader but he doesn't allow me to pay and I feel so guilty because we are just friends and I don't want to freeload off him. I have tried reasoning with him but he just shuts me down and to me it seems like he's offended? But I could be wrong. 

Today something strange happened. We were shopping around and we passed by a shop and I saw a really adorable Winnie the pooh stuff toy and I just causally commented how cute it was. He went in and grabbed 3 types of Pooh and asked me to choose 1 or he's going to buy all 3. I was a little taken aback and I told him he didn't need to buy me anything. But he kept insisting he was going to buy all 3 so I had to try my hardest to convince him I didn't want any. He put them back thankfully and we left. 

I guess now I have to be careful about what I say. I really had no intention of getting the Pooh. It was just a random comment. What's next? If I say a tshirt is nice, he's going to buy also? Or force me to choose? How do I stop this behaviour? Why has my friend changed? What should I do?

815,"I have been together with my boyfriend for 6 years. We were very close, we studied together , been to student exchange together, encouraged and help each other in our studies and transition into adulting. We created too much beautiful memories for the past 6 years. 

We are actually very different innately. We have differing viewpoints and personalities. He doesn’t like to express while I feel that communication is essential to build trust and bond. As a result, due to communication breakdown, we fought a lot. A lot more lately especially we started to run a hectic schedule after work started. 

I would say despite all these problems, love still glue us together and we are always never giving up on each other. We fought, we called it quit before but we are still together today.. because we are both persistent.

Just lately , I discovered that he was actually communicating more with his female colleagues as compare to with me. A lot more of his life, interesting videos and jokes. It broke my heart that he had been lying or masking some stuffs like his activities , his whereabouts etcs. I feel that those are important enough to let me know. Or maybe if it was in the past, he would tell me. 

I know perhaps the reason why he refused to tell me was because he was afraid that I would get jealous or angry. Don’t get me wrong, he ain’t cheating. Although the stuffs ain’t any big deal, I was very bothered by how truthfulness is lacking. I am worrying that if this continues, next time our trust might totally cease. 

I chose not to tell him or confront him because I know things will worsen and I’d rather try to absorb all the negativity myself. It’s actually hurting more. 

We are also not really progressing and I’m not sure if he wants to settle down or move on to the next step.  All in all, I felt rather insecure and uncertain lately.

I’m afraid that my behaviour will take a toll on him. i m not sure if I’m toxic either.. i can’t help my insecurities. so yeah, do u think that i shld break up with him to let him find a girl not as problematic as i am? or shld i stick with him since he is willing to compromise w me? he is a very good guy, he is very proud and protective of me. however, because we r not official, on social media it seems as tho i do not have any boyfriend thus many guys constantly hit me up for my number, with that he doesn’t even make me block them he jus tells me to blow them off nicely… he’s a very decent guy and i love him so much so that i am willing to let him go and give him a chance to find someone better. not sure if its bc its my first time in love that i don’t know what i shld do and everything is by gut feeling? I’m scared that he doesn’t know what he is capable of receiving thus sticks w me :< tell me what i shld do pls and thank you for reading this :)

831,"To OP of #72209

Here's another POV apart from the one from #72217

I used to be one who always check up on my friends as well. Asking them out for meals, catching up with them, only for the same to happen to me. They don't reply/say they're busy/say they'll get back to you after checking their schedule etc.

Obviously I was sad when I didn't get replies, thinking that they were not really good friends etc. But in recent times, I've became really caught up with school, family, work and everything else in between. This time around, I became the one who didn't reply and told them I'll get back to them, but ended up forgetting about it and not replying them at all.

What I'm trying to say is, yes, maybe your 'friends' aren't really quality friends, but until you've experienced being insanely busy, then you'll realise that it might actually be the truth. 

Last seen timings are toxic (which is why I turned em off) I had a few chats that I haven't opened just from sheer busy-ness and the only time I'm on my phone is when I'm checking in on group projects.

Bottom line, some of your friends are probably jerks, but some of your friends might actually be genuinely busy (you'll know, like in my case, I replied the individual chats explaining the 'ghosting'). And you'll soon learn to 'sieve' out who are the real friends and who aren't. But in the meantime, I think it's more important to take care of yourself, sometimes the checker needs to be checked in on at times, so maybe spend a little bit more time on yourself doing the things you like.

All the best and hang in there!

I’m going to admit, whenever I see my friends from other courses such as business and FASS courses having time to relax on weekends or go outing during school term, I will get triggered jealous due to unfairness sometimes. I on the other hand, have been drilling on the amount of assignments and projects given, burning of every weekend and spending less time with family etc. 

I know you guys are going to say I do not know how to strike a life balance. FYI, I have 7 Modules this semester with an acceptable workload of 22 MCs. It feels like I’m overloaded with the work due to the difficulty of the engineering modules. I’m also doing badly in exams. Thus, negative thoughts then came pouring into my head, making me wanted to give up at times.

These are the advices i heard from various sources ? 

1. I’m still adjusting to sch life and thus the culture shock is there

2. Engineering degree is a professional degree and it will be a huge return in working life in future. This, I suffer more as compared to my friends now.

838,"I have a friend that I've known since the start of university. Let's call this friend A. A and I are in the same course together though we mostly take different classes in a given semester. The thing is, for a while now I've been feeling like I'm kinda being used or over-relied on and taken for granted. I do treat A as a good friend despite the fact that we don't meet up a lot (most of my friends are busy people and I am as well) and we give each other advice, hang out sometimes etc. However A has this bad habit so to speak. A would always ask me to check A's work. And by work I mean A's essays. And not just for one class but for multiple classes. And these aren't even classes that I'm taking or have taken before. A gets me to read these essays, and ask how to improve the content, if the essay is okay etc. Don't get me wrong, I am more than happy to help a friend in need and do this. Once or twice is fine. But this happens with almost every assignment A has, for almost every single class and across multiple semesters. And I do have my own classes to take, assignments to work on and life to live etc. It's gotten to the point where I feel that yes although A writes the actual content, aren't I the one directing the ideas etc? And it feels like A is relying on me too much, and I'm honestly exhausted.

1.

Either you intentionally left them out in your confession, or you collected your pack from the wrong faculty. 

2. You couldn’t even identify if the welfare director is a he or a she, and yet you complain that your time was wasted voting for the welfare director…?

843,"Honestly as a bilingual Chinese Australian girl who is born in Shanghai and moved to Sydney when I was 13, I'm sick to the death of the divide between Singaporeans and Chinese international students. I came to NUS after finishing my high school in Sydney because why not since some of my relatives from China stay here for background information.

Why on earth does this have to happen? Because of certain norms held that you find unpleasant? Well let me tell you a story, I was bullied in my first year of high school for the exact reasons you guys hate them for. I was mocked for my poor English, the way I dressed, the mannerisms I carried over, I was so lonely and I could only hang out with other Chinese born students in my English as a second language class. I was bullied by Asian Australians who wanted nothing to do with me because they were afraid that someone like me undermined their social standing in Australia. I eventually adapted because in my ESL class, all international students of all backgrounds in my school suddenly started to make friends with each other based on our personalities and who we are as a person, not because of our cultural backgrounds. That way I could finally embrace Australian culture and learn to build bridges between international students in my high school and locals, and realise 'integration' cannot be forced.

Now coming into NUS, I see this very same divide and it reminds me of my high school days. I feel a sense of urgency to bridge this divide as a bicultural individual (well tbh I still find myself more Chinese than Australian because I still dress like someone from Mainland and my traditional values but still pretty Australian in my thought process). Please be understanding of this Chinese international students, they are already in so much financial burden and struggling. We honestly need a dialogue to find a comprimise to bridge this bitter divide.

Since I am still halfway through my degree, I originally planned to elope after graduation in 2 years time. However, due to visa issues, my GF cannot stay in Singapore that long. In any case, her hometown is a small village so there are few jobs available for uni grads - even my poly diploma is probably overkill. I am confident that since everybody knows everybody in her village, there is no problem finding a job once I arrive. Frankly, I am not a snobbish like other Singaporeans, so I don’t feel the need to waste even more time just to get a useless piece of paper. The quality of education in NUS is not as high as its rankings suggest, so I wont be missing out on much. 

And yet... even though logic dictates that I should drop out of NUS, I am hesitating. Do I just not love my GF enough to make this sacrifice for her? Am I subconsciously being racist and judgemental like my parents? Or am I just a spoilt singaporean brat who prefers material comforts over true love?

857,"Hello all, just a warning that it’s gonna be a long read ahead...

Recently, my friends (both females and males) have been increasingly flaking/ ghosting me on text and in real life... :( 

With regards to text, it’s always one of the following these days:

 1. Don’t open my message (but some of their last seen clearly says something ????).
2. Blue tick/ leave me hanging on  “seen” forever (?) (like until now it remains a blue tick/ “seen”).
3. Reads message, replies only 2-3 days later.

Sigh, I know it’s finals season and everyone is busy — I’m busy too. And I honestly don’t expect any instantaneous reply. 

But surely y’all can reply during your breaks as your day passes? It  doesn’t feel good at all when they leave me on read and take 2-3 days to reply me. I start to have self-doubts that I said/ done something wrong... :(

Personally, if I need more time to reply to a message, I would just drop one sentence “busy atm will reply later” so that I won’t leave people hanging. Am I being unfair/ demanding in wishing my friends at least let me know that they are busy and need more time before they can get back to my messages?

And speaking of flaking/ ghosting, I have made arrangements/ plans with some of said friends recently. Unfortunately, in the past two weeks, I have encountered last minute cancellations on me at least thrice already!! (Fyi, some of the plans were prearranged weeks ago, so these last minute cancellations kinda struck me real hard when I go onto Instagram stories and find out that the real reason I got ghosted is because they are busy hanging out with other friends... AKA I’m being replaced (?), like wow I’m lost for words.)

I’m angry, but more than that, I’m truly hurt. Why? Well, I have to laugh things off and pretend I’m “okay”, when in reality I’m far from okay. Just because we have been friends for years, and therefore I shouldn’t hold a grudge over such “small” matters aka forgive and forget? It’s one thing to be cancelled upon, but another thing when they don’t see the need to apologise on the account of our years of friendship?

I do not wish to put a strain on our years of friendship just because of these seemingly “minor” matters, but it still hurts that years of friendship may actually lead to complacency and overlooking of such basic respects as humans? :( 

I still love and cherish my friends and hoping this is just a temporary phase... I can’t help but start to question if the fault lies with me instead...

To those who read through that whole chunk of my lament: Thanks for sticking by, provide me with some advice please? :(

I’m generally coping fine, I don’t really think of him much or miss him, and have no problems focusing on my work daily. But somehow after the breakup, I just feel like withdrawing from all social interactions and spending all my free time on my own. Even texting people feels like a chore nowadays and so I always take ages to reply, which I feel quite bad about. I lose interest to go out and meet people, even my close group of friends. Currently, there’s also this very nice guy who’s trying to get close to me, but while I’m trying my best to keep an open mind and just be friendly with him, I find our interactions very exhausting.
 I didn’t recall being like this after my past breakups, in fact last time I would try to engage in a lot of activities and constantly surround myself with people so as not to feel lonely and depressed.

Just some background FYI, I have been living with a chronic autoimmune condition since childhood but I have lived with it and gotten through school all these years and completed my degree without any problem. I am going for regular medical check ups and my condition is stable, confident for me to say that it will not affect my work. During interviews, I have been told to my face that “your illness is going to be a problem because you will be often gone for your medical checkups” (which only happens once every two- three months).  I have also been asked “how many medications do you take on a daily basis?” like that is going to matter, and hearing a huge sigh after I mention a number. 

How can I possibly prove that my illness is just part of me and is not going to affect my ability to work to the potential employers? 

Getting called to the interview stage and then being rejected, (albeit there might be other reasons such as my lack of work experience), I can’t help but think that my illness might be the reason.

888,"I broke up 6 months ago with my one and only ex. We had a 4 years relationship. It has been smooth sailing until his time to serve NS came. I matriculated into uni, expanded my social circle a few times more than the one I had back when I was 18. Due to the lack of communication, meet ups etc, he started getting insecure which leads to his jealousy. But we still hung on till his ORD. Thought everything would carry on like how it did before he got into army and I got into uni, but somehow, things started getting worse. Even his mom came into the picture. She kept complaining about the number of male friends I hang out with. And although he always defends me, both of us knew that the relationship wouldn't work out if it continued this way so we came to a decision and broke up.

6 months have passed and I haven't gotten over him. My heart feels so empty. I miss his smile, his existence, his messages in the morning, his sweet gestures and all the effort he puts into the relationship. I still read his messages during my free time and look through our photos every other night. What made it even worse, since both of us applied and got into the same major, we constantly bump into each other on campus. He would be holding a cup of iced milo which I used to make him quit the coffee addiction he had during A levels. And every single time I take a glance, he would be wearing the watch both of us got for our 2nd anniversary. Since both of us separated on good terms, although we don't contact, he would still wave when our eyes meet but I'd always pretend that I didn't notice.

It's been 6 months and I still love him. The urge of getting back with him is really strong especially when I see him on campus, but my friends discouraged me from goimg back to him. I'm just really afraid he doesn't feel the same way anymore since it has been quite a while or what if he already has a girlfriend, since there is this girl who is frequently on his insta story. Or if we actually got back, the same problem would arise. I'm super conflicted. How?

I successfully pursued my girlfriend while she was still attached and I got her pregnant soon after. I love her, and this news only accelerated my decision to marry her. The problem is, our parents do not see eye to eye with each other and had a heated argument during the first meeting.

My parents’ view is that we are not financially independent and both are studying. 

My gf’s mum has been showing support although she did mention that her preference is for her daughter to marry when she is independent.

My parents have come to a compromise to allow us to marry, the only criteria is a simple tea ceremony with my gf and I serving tea and greeting my parents as mom and dad.

My gf’s mum has taken this to issue. Citing that my gf’s mum has passed away last year so it is inauspicious to have tea ceremony 3 years from the death. But she is ok with rom and a simple wedding lunch or dinner.

What should I do? Both parties are firm on their position and I really want to get both parties’ blessings.

I cared nothing about my soft skills or character development.

The reason I say she is 'abnormally normal' is because other friends who have also been through a break up would either confide in me or rant about their ex without me asking, but as for her case, she functions absolutely normally. If I were to nitpick on her behavior, she laughs and smiles even more, talks even more, and she has a totally different vibe and I'm worried she is just putting up a facade so that people won't be worried.  Furthermore, I can see her puffy eyes even with those makeup. Whenever I asks if she is ok, she just shrugs it off casually. Or if I were to bring up the topic, she changes it immediately. I've been friends with her for 9 years and I know that she treats this relationship very seriously, and she has always been the kind who likes bottling up her feelings.

I am actually very vocal about my mental health and my friends know that I can be unstable sometimes. But the fact is that I know that they have their own lives so ever since a few months ago I have been just keeping things to myself.

I have also opened up to my family members (selective tho not all) and like they offer to help but sometimes what I say gets shot down so I'm kinda just sad like I hope people will just listen instead of brushing off the topic. Tho I understand that not a lot of people are comfortable listening to my rants and its okay.

But recently it feels like even if I want to talk about it, I cant put my thoughts to words anymore. And yeah I feel very empty and like despite my efforts to actually vanish and take a break from everyone, FOMO still stands and there are times i feel that even if I wasnt around nobody would notice which is a red flag I know.

I hate that I'm like that and I honestly tried so hard to be positive like its been going on since like 1 year ago. Sometimes I breakdown within a few hours or even minutes, or if things went well maybe like a few weeks, but breakdowns are bound to happen anyways.

Some background about me, i'm an average guy that doesnt particularly shine in any aspects (ie. Looks, grades, wealth) And i came across this girl that i've like in primary 1 while we were in the same class.

Since then, i have been her secret admirer throughout our primary school phrase. She was like a perfect role model that is looked well upon by the school and students. Thus enlarging our distance to become friends. After our graduation, we lost contact and social media is not a norm in those years.

I made a point to remain single as she is the only one that ever cross my mind and friendzoned all advances from other girls. I have this constant thought about her every night before sleeping for the past 18 years (ie. Is she doing well, eating healthily, etc.)

Fast forward, after graduation and working in MNC, my colleague who has no relation to her, had chance upon her contact number and she's currently pursuing a business major in NTU (ahem.. CSI).

I'm so happy to hear that she's doing well and looked up on her social media platform to find thst she rarely posts things online. Through her dp in whatsapp, im quite confident that the number is genuine as she looks almost the same after so many years.

Im having thoughts if i should initiate a conversation with her as i feel there's only one chance and i cant mess up.

Would greatly appreciate if girls can share their thoughts about receiving random text from some dude so many years back as acceptable or creepy., and if there are other methods or suggestions to recommend. Thanks alot for your time.

903,"In need of serious advice.

There’s this guy I game together with since last year and we started dating since we met around 4 months ago. 

He is super sweet and nice to me. The thing is, he has really traditional, conservative, restrictive parents. Both his parents are quite old and have retired years ago. At age 23, he has never once spent the night outside, never brought a friend home, never had a single part time job because his parents think those jobs are useless (the only income he earned for himself was from NS) , get fined for using phone in toilet at home, and though he claims his curfew time is a “grey area”, he never seem to reach home past 12. The list goes on...

There was once when his parents were overseas yet he still refused to bring me to see his house because he was so scared of being found out. The one time I was in his neighbourhood he had to constantly look out for his parents too. 

He knows that his parents shouldn’t make such unreasonable rules but he already had that fear of defiance in him since childhood, when he got beaten a lot and almost got chased out of house from lying. It’s not like I can pressure him to defy his parents. Even when I ask him if he can new year countdown with me he just says “I really don’t know”. It’s like he can’t and won’t even try. I really like him  but I’m not confident that in the long term his parents will be more chill and give him more freedom (judging by how his much older sisters are as heavily guarded as himself). I also fear that since his parents are strictly religious and I’m a free thinker they might force me to convert or simply force him to break up with me. 

I know it’s still early to worry about such problems but I feel like I’m dating a primary school kid even though he is mature on the inside. Should I wait it out? What should I do?

When I researched a bit further, I realise that some of my higher SES friends have heard about it. None of them were invited to the parties though. 

My girlfriend who works in the hospitality sector told me that certain five - star hotel private dining rooms in the Orchard Road area are often booked for such purpose, for people to interact with other fellow mates of similar socioeconomic status. 

Was wondering if anyone else has heard of this dining club and if they still organise such events. As a sociology grad, this is both amusing and relevant in the broader national conversation on class.

This got me rather stressed and restrained and I'm not sure what to do. Even a simple meal with someone of the opposite gender will get them raging, thinking that I'm in a relationship with the other person and will reprimand me. 

Some might say since I'm living under the same roof as them,I have to just follow the curfews and stuff. I'll just let that be and in addition to that I even inform them about my whereabouts. But i find it constraining that I have to not go out with friends of opposite gender. Like hello I'm in university and I would say it's nearly impossible that you would not interact with people from opposite genders. I had no choice but to lie quite often, but there are times where they see me eating with my friends (SG is small so...). I cant even go drinking in peace. 

How can I convince them that I'm mature enough to decide my life without them interfering? 

I'm in a relationship as well, but I want to date my partner openly without having to hide him from my parents. If I were in his shoes I'll feel pretty upset about it.

906,"In JC, I came out of the closet as a gay man. At that time, I faced alot of discrimination from everybody: my parents were very angry with me, many of my friends left me and even random acquaintences whom I barely knew started giving me wierd looks. 

Since then, things have changed for the better. My parents are now accepting of my lifestyle, I made new friends (of course, my very best friends never left me) and I no longer care about what strangers think. I don't have the statistics to back this up, but I think that in recent years, Singaporean society in general has become less judgemental and more welcoming. Also, I would like to give special thanks to my very wonderful partner who has been very supportive during the past few years. Thank you, everybody. I couldn't have survived the past few years without your help.

The problem is this: I dont feel attracted to guys anymore. I have no problems performing in bed with my partner, but emotionally speaking I am just not into it anymore. On the other hand, I find myself attracted to girls around me. I also started a new cmb profile and matched up with a girl.  We may not have not had penetrative sex yet, but we have already progressed to the stage of kissing/heavy petting. I really want to pursue this new relationship further. To be perfectly honest with myself, I think that I was straight all along, and my homosexual inclinations were just part of my attention-seeking, teenage rebellious phase which I have since outgrown. I am sorry for all the emotional trauma that my parents and ex-GF had to suffer on my behalf. I am sorry for all the drama within my social circle. I wish I could turn back the clock. 

Should I come out of the closet again as a straight man? I really like this girl and I do want to take my new relationship to the next level. On the other hand, I am worried about what my friends will think. Also, in the past few years, I have helped out with advocacy efforts for the LGBT community in Singapore/NUS. I have also given advice to some of my juniors about LGBT matters. Today, even though I now consider myself a straight man, I still mantain close ties with the LGBT community and I am afraid of the community backlash if they find out the truth.

907,"Some backstory, I try to not make it long. I've known my best friend for a long time, really long, since we were four. Maybe even longer. We lived in small town and we were neighbors. Our parents know each other. We grew up together, but I didn't start getting attracted to her until I started getting interested in girls, and at this point the relationship already turned into a ""brother-sister"" relationship. But we were kids. I doubt this thing would work anyway.

Time passed. We started maturing, she started to dating. At this point, I realized this ship has sailed, and started dating other women as well, while still being friends with her. I still had feelings for her, but I decided to bury them. It really worked, our friendship was great. We were the best friends. Time was passing.

That was going on until four days ago. Recently I broke up with my ex because she cheated on me. That kinda broke me, and I kinda realized now it was one of the reason why I did what I did. But anyway, after I broke up with my ex I started reevaluating my life. I realized that I can bury those feelings all I want, but I still love her. And after all those years I love her even more. I decided, that I should confess all my feelings to her. I was scared how she could react. I was scared if that will break up our longtime friendship. I was scared to lose one of the most important people in my life. But I realize that I had to do it. Because If I didn't know how she feels about me, it would eat me for the rest of my life. And frankly, it would be making and her a favor by confessing my feelings.

So, four days ago I told her I want to meet up with her and told her something important. We meet up at my place and basically told her the whole deal. I almost chickened out, but when I told her It felt like a huge stone just disappeared from my heart. I think I almost passed out.

Her reaction. At first, she thought it was a joke. Like, it was a while before she realized I was 100% serious. And once she realized that, she went completely berserk. Lots of screaming, lots of yelling, lots of crying, lots of cursing. I tried explaining her everything but she couldn't hear it. In her opinion, I lied to her for years, decades. That our whole friendship was a lie. I explained to her our friendship was 100% real all this years, and it was sincere. But I explained to her I can no longer live not knowing how she feels about me. So I asked her how she feels about me. Again, lots of screaming, yelling, crying etc but her answer was basically ""I don't know"" and ""You can't just drop a bomb on me like that"", and repeating that every 5 minutes. After an hour she told me she needs to think about it alone and left.

Three days ago, I got a text from her saying she wants to talk. This time at her place. I've never seen her so depressed as that day. It was like talking to a different person. The talk was mostly her repeating ""why didn't you tell about this sooner"", ""why now"" again and again. I told her I just have to be sure about her feelings towards me. After some time she finally told me that yes, she had feeling for me in the past. But since I never shown any interests toward her she assumed I didn't have any interests in her and treated this as friendship so she dropped it as well. I asked her if there's any chance for us. Her answer was ""I don't know"" ""maybe"" ""this is too much for me"". So I told her we can continue this conversation when she sorts her out if she needs more time. Two Days ago I get a call not from her, but her roommate. She told me she knows everything because she told her everything, and the she's been crying all day long ""because of me"". I called her if we can talk, but she told me she needs time. Then her another friend called me, and then it kinda stopped being a private matter.

Yesterday I get a message from her friend that she doesn't want to leave house and that she completely shut down. I asked her friends if I could talk to her but she told me that's not a good idea. I also got a call from her parents (yeah) asking me if all the stuff are true. I confirmed, they weren't happy about it, but they understand my decision. I knew her parents for a long time and they are great people.

And now Today, she finally texts and tell me she wants to talk. We talk, and I try to be more demanding this time. I told her I need to know if she has any feelings toward me. It took a while, but yes, she told me she still has some feelings toward me, and would like to at least try the relationship. When I was leaving, she told me to wait, and kissed me. It shocked me, and I could feel the awkwardness in the air. I left after that. This has never happened before, she might have kissed me on the cheeks or something in the past but nothing like that.

This comes to my question. What to do? Was that a good thing what I did? Does that thing has a future? I feel like today was a good thing, but I still feel doubts. I also feel very guilty, and over the past these days I felt like something bad was going to happen. Was her reaction good? Do I have to worry about her?

TL;DR: Confessed love to my best friend since we were kids. After I confessed her feelings for me she reacted strongly, said she needed time but after few days she told me she has feelings for me and kissed me. I don't know if I did the right thing, and what to do now.

Could you share some thoughts and advice regarding on the part-time degree BTech(Computing) programme in NUS? 

How is this BTech(Computing) course different from BEng(Computer science) part-time course in NTU? Is the modules/coverage not as indepth as compared to the full-time course in NUS? Is there bell-curve in BTech (if have, it is within part-time students only or the whole sch)? Is the BTech course offer similar modules as the full time programme? Is this fast-paced?

Noticed there isn't any BTech(Computer Science) course, whereas there is BTech(Software Engineering) course. Would like to understand why there isn't any BTech computer science course as there is a full-time programme on this, but instead it has a BTech Software Enginnering course which NUS currently offers Master course on this. What is the difference between CS and SE, and any reason why BTech programme is on SE instead of CS?

Is BTech cert recognized by employers? Is the employment rate high? As given from the name of the cert, it would be easily recognized that it is not a full-time course. Is there any difference on the quality  of the cert between a full time and part time course from NUS? How is NTU BTech degree differs from other computing part time degree from Private uni etc?

Lastly, what would be recommended for working adult to pursue a part time degree - BTech(computing) degree from NUS or BEng(Com science) course from NTU? Given that NTU emphasized that both full-time & part-time BEng cert are the same, hence it would be more recognized (in a way)? 

Greatly appreciate your inputs on this. Thank you very much!

I am well aware that with hardly any work experience I would be considered as an entry level candidate (all temp, contract jobs - only one remotely related to the field I’m aiming for) expecting a high paying salary is not realistic and thus, I have always stated my expected salary as $2500 to $2800 (which I was told is an acceptable amount). 

The jobs I have applied to are mainly from the healthcare sector, I have sent out resumes to other sectors as well in desperation to land a job, ANY job. (Not sure if this is the right way to go about it but I’m losing hope). Job fairs I have attended a few with no callbacks whatsoever. With regards to feedback from interviews, I have sending emails to follow up on my interviews, in hopes of receiving feedbacks and bettering myself for subsequent interviews, however hardly anyone gets back to me after the “rejection notification” email. 

One major reject that I had was instead of during an internship or a FYP during my last year, I went with the options of doing modules to satisfy the credits. Have been contemplating on doing a Master’s/ Graduate Diploma, however, I do not have the financial means to do so at the moment. Thus, that will have to wait. Everyday going through the same old momentum of scowering through job portals and applying for jobs, without any callbacks is tough. I’ve heard that the job market has been bad but when will it change? 

The jobportals that I have been using are Careers@Gov, Jobstreet, JobCentral and or directly applying at the organisations’ page. If there are any other methods, I’d appreciate it if you could share. Thank you. 

For those who are in this same jobless predicament, hang in there, hang on to that tiny bit of hope. Have a nice day.

I gave him three reminders, and every time he says he has not enough money and will return next time. I really want to believe him, but he has a history of dishonesty, not just in money matters, but also in school and life (which I have also called him out for, but he repeatedly denies it and tells me to mind my own business).

Also, he relies on taxis all the time because he's always late, and has managed to travel overseas multiple times throughout the past year. And he spends a lot overseas. And he has an expensive smoking habit (like 1 pack a day). So I find it very unbelievable that he has no money to return back to me.

I have presented this evidence to him, but he always laughs it off and changes the subject. Once, I attempted to really grill him with the evidence and make sure he gives me a proper answer, and he suddenly got defensive and accused me of being so intrusive into his personal life. He painted himself as the ""better man"" who tries to solve conflicts amicably, while I was painted as the guy who always picks up a fight with him.

So basically, I've been having breakdowns constantly, even though there is nothing wrong. Like my days went pass with me smiling and all, but at the end of the day, I just can't help it but feel sad.

And like to say I have breakdowns is not entirely the story because I'm actually stuck at the edge of breaking down and I can't actually breakdown which sucks even more (I can't seem to talk about it or even cry about it).

Does anyone have advices on how to help myself get better from this?

919,"Hi Prof Ben,

Could you share some thoughts and advice regarding on the part-time degree BTech(Computing) programme in NUS? 

How is this BTech(Computing) course different from BEng(Computer science) part-time course in NTU? Is the modules/coverage not as indepth as compared to the full-time course in NUS? Is there bell-curve in BTech (if have, it is within part-time students only or the whole sch)? Is the BTech course offer similar modules as the full time programme? Is this fast-paced?

Noticed there isn't any BTech(Computer Science) course, whereas there is BTech(Software Engineering) course. Would like to understand why there isn't any BTech computer science course as there is a full-time programme on this, but instead it has a BTech Software Enginnering course which NUS currently offers Master course on this. What is the difference between CS and SE, and any reason why BTech programme is on SE instead of CS?

Is BTech cert recognized by employers? Is the employment rate high? As given from the name of the cert, it would be easily recognized that it is not a full-time course. Is there any difference on the quality  of the cert between a full time and part time course from NUS? How is NTU BTech degree differs from other computing part time degree from Private uni etc?

Lastly, what would be recommended for working adult to pursue a part time degree - BTech(computing) degree from NUS or BEng(Com science) course from NTU? Given that NTU emphasized that both full-time & part-time BEng cert are the same, hence it would be more recognized (in a way)? 

Greatly appreciate your inputs on this. Thank you very much!

921,"Hellu, another NUS Architecture student here, come to share my opinions on this tsunami of a lifestyle we get swept up in. I don’t claim to speak for other Architecture students’ lives and thoughts on this, but I hope my two cents here goes a long way.
On my way home today, I saw an old man. He stood next to a swing for a long while, then sat on it and swung, having the time of his life. I thought to myself, “When was the last time I felt carefree enough to do that?”
As Archi students, our lives and minds are consumed by the work that we do, the never-ending “Project”. Even as I write this, I’m thinking, “How much time is this taking away from my design work?” We push aside issues that most would consider critical to functioning in human society, like politics, socialization, spirituality, and mental well-being just so that we can produce the best spaces for others to live their best lives in. Ironic, isn’t it, that the people who design for other people barely even live like people anymore. 
Some who read this may think, “Oh, these people are just complaining because they lack the rigor to succeed in this profession.” But I think deep down, even the most successful of architects have paid a deep price in their lives to be able to create for the human race. This doesn’t get better when we say to people,” Aki siong ah, wa die lah!”, “Aiya, Aki no life one la!” When we do this, we are trivializing the pains that we go through, turning it into a reputation and a twisted badge of honor to have “survived” Architecture, and people might just assume, after encountering this vicious self-denial we should be able to take this kind of pain forever.
Architects really do put a lot of thought into everything that they create, making damn sure that the people who use the spaces they create enjoy and benefit in ways they might not even realize. For all the non-Architecture students who see this post, the next time you walk into a building that you like going to, try to notice and think about what the architect might have done to make your life within comfortable, your experience enjoyable, and make you come back time after time, just because you “like the place”. For all the Archi students who happen to look up from your models and butter papers to see this, take a little break. Go for a run. Talk to a friend. Go have dinner. Write a weird rant essay like me. Remember to live. Remember you’re a person too.

922,"Referring to #71862

Another ex NUS architecture student here who would like to add on to the first point made. Have been to exchange, and together with opinions from other Singaporeans who have went to other countries to study Architecture, many commented about how ""Tutors in Singapore are competing with one another to see who gives more work"". I'm not pin pointing that ALL NUS architecture tutors like that, in my time I have had the blessed experience of amazing tutors who were not only open to diverse learning styles, but also encouraging and motivation considering that architecture is truthfully a grim industry.

Regarding the point made on depression, it's definitely true. Students who were once passionate suddenly wanting to quit the course, student dropping out halfway, the anxiety, panic attacks...it's all true but yet students can not afford to let it affect their production because the project is too important - it's either you produce something, pass and promote, or you fail it altogether and retake it a semester later. There's this unhealthy culture of students producing more work just for Tutor's validation, and peer pressure to just mindlessly produce quantity instead of quality defeats the whole point of nurturing creativity in the first place. 

Also heard from some seniors that feedbacks do not seem to have effect at all. Students who provided anonymous feedback on stress and depression caused from over work goes ignored, because certain tutors are important to the school's reputation. It still seems to be an issue, currently counseling a junior in Year 2 who reported that one third of his/her studio is suffering from depression under a certain tutor whom I guess is rather well known but I shall not name.

To the person who penned post #71862, I think it's a good thing to raise such awareness. No change can be brought about if nobody knows about such stuff, and things like these should not remain under the carpet for sure.

924,"NUS Architecture student here. I think it's about time everyone knows the kind of stuff NUS architecture students are going through or have at least gone through: 

1. There are tutors who brag to other tutors that ""their students do not sleep"". What kind of teaching methodology is that? Are design students expected to be creative without basic ample rest? Many often say that NUS is not teaching architecture the way it's meant to be. Students always stressed to produce, but creativity isn't 24/7 you know?

2. Depression is real among students who cannot keep up. Yet it is often brushed off as a joke as ""nothing can be done about it"".  

3. The jump between year one and year two is absurd. Year one students barely learnt the basics, and year two students are suddenly assigned with a large scale project. Steep learning curve killed the passion of many potential students, got a feeling the year coordinators do not understand what students have learnt or are struggling with 

4. Current year 2-4 students have no fixed studio space to work on, only the small space at YIH. Not enough space for models to be left safely on the desk, and transportation often lead to models being spoilt. Expecting all students to have such a large table at home? no go.

5. Year 1 to master students have to fight over only 5 laser cutters in the past, now even fewer as some are reserved for ID students. Where are NUS funds being spent on?

The next time you see your architecture friend out there, give them a pat or hug. They're really suffering. Really.

I was thinking, before we call it a day, whether I should go in for a kiss, and we did. As I was travelling alone, we spend most of the time video calling, talking to each other, as though we had a thing. Days went by, and our conversations became longer, and we found out more things about each other.

When I returned, we went out as per usual, and something just seems out of place. She didn’t smile like she used to before, her eyes were watery and I just had to ask her what’s up. She cried while hugging me, telling me that it was difficult for her to move on from her ex, and she wanted to give us a chance. We hugged, and we had kissed once more.

934,"Hey everyone, I am really at a loss in this relationship and I need your advice on how to move forward.

Let’s call him/her G. We have been together for a little more than a year. But it has not been smooth sailing. Back to the beginning, I met G while in my CCA. As time passed and we were practicing for our performance, I unknowingly fell for G. To find out more about G, I went to ask some of my mutual friends and their advice was that we are not suitable for each other. G was deemed as someone that is quite needy and needs much more attention and I’m considered to be the kind of person that is more independent and wants instead of needs in a relationship (idk how to explain also). 

Fast forward to after the performance, I was about to spend a semester overseas for exchange. At this point we are still not together but things were complicated where we went out on dates (guess we’re dating?) and flirted with each other quite a bit. But G is already quite possessive and does not like that there are two people that are opposite gender of mine in the group of friends i’m going on exchange with. I promised that I will not get too close with them even though i was close with one of them (Lets call him/her H. and H was a SA in a group where I was MGL). So off I went to my exchange and so the start of my hell (note that i was not together with G at that point). when my exchange started, G was behaving very bizarrely and getting upset at every little thing that i did. During the orientation party that my exchange school organised for all the exchange students, H got very drunk and could not get back to the dormitories on his/her own, other friends of that group were also not available because it’s either they went for second round or that he have to go back to the dorms earlier. So it was only H and me. The whole time our buddies and I only hold H until we reached the roadside and H just sat at the curb and fell asleep while i was looking everywhere for a cab while still making sure that H is safe. It was just entering spring and I have gave my coat to H so H will not catch a cold. I believe what I did was just being a good friend helping another friend out. But i was scolded and flared up upon by G for all the things i have done. Am i supposed to have left H there or what is another thing that i should have done because i really don’t know what i should have done.
Another time, the whole group of us went to get some street food and not wanting to spend too much money, the group decided to share some of the street food. In the end I shared my food (which is not even like a corn cob that kind where you have to “share” saliva with the other person) with H. I told G about this incident and even assured that nothing happened, yet I was bombarded with all the toxic scolding, it was like mental torture. I cannot really remember the exact things G said but I remembered that i was forced to keep my contacts with the two of them at the minimal. 
Then, there were even times where the whole group was deciding to go somewhere together but i just faked illness or tiredness to not go. Due to all these incidents, I have to cut all the contacts with H unless it’s for work or like formal stuff. Which i found ridiculous and like absurd. But in the end I obliged with it...  

Another thing happened during exchange that forever scarred me. While all the above were happening, G dares to say that G wants to go and meet with someone that G has a crush on. (I know, even i find it absurd when i read back what i typed). That incident ended with G saying it's his/her way of finding out whether he/she has feeling for me (like WTF). I was so sad when this happened that i went to a quiet place and cried while calling my close friend back in sg.

Another incident is that G went to visit a close friend at that person's hall (opposite gender) and the two of them drank in the room alone. Yet I am here having to cut my contacts with other people when I am hanging out in a group.

But i admit that i have done things that i promise i will keep my word but not kept my word. Things like keeping in contact with G as much as possible. Skyping G almost everyday for as long as i can. Im not saying that i dont want to do those things, but i dont think i should be scolded for not doing that sometimes, because of just how much i am already doing it.

By the end of the exchange, I realised i have only remember all the quarrels and scoldings and arguments and nothing much about the actual exchange. But i thought okay it will finally be over and yeah maybe G is just very sad that i go so far and for so long.

We eventually got together after I came back from exchange. But G started having issues with my other friends. particularly my closest friends from uni. In this group of friends, we are always without filters and always joke about very inappropriate things and thats how our group dynamic is, and we understand that what everyone in the group is joking about are just joking and no real intentions behind it. But G cannot take it and wants me to cut contact with those friends that i have hang out with since i started uni.
We already have a post graduation trip planned within the group and when i asked if i could bring G along, the group was not very fond of the idea because  they want the exchange to be with people they are really close with and because of what they have heard about G and how G treated me while i was on exchange. Again, the grad trip was a nightmare and much worse than what happened during the exchange. I was not happy at all during the trip, and many times i just stayed in the airbnb all day instead of going out with the rest, I hardly interacted with everyone and even when I went out with the group, I have to constantly take pictures to show that i am way behind and away from the group and not participating in the group conversation of whatever. I was in agony and it was the worst trip. 
Long story short, right now I have still not contacted them or met up with them since after graduation. 

G has always forced me through various ways that i am the one that f-ed up and G is the one that should the priority. I was made to make many promise about things that i dont even believe in if not the argument and quarrel will never end. I am so so sick of all these things happening. 

Right not, I have not contacted that group of friends. but recently I got interested in an activity and have been meeting around once a month with two other very very close friends of mine whom i knew from secondary school. Yet when i told G about this monthly meetup, G told me that it is a bit excessive to meet once a month. I was speechless. 

Another thing, I am currently working at a small company that hires quite a lot of interns. And when i tell G that i went for lunch with the interns, G will get so upset at me and ask me to go and have fun with them and dont talk to G. I am again at loss at work to do about . I am afraid that this will be problem that will just be there forever since i will have to work for another 20 to 30 years.

Another thing is that during my lunch, i am expected to reply G's messages straight away and must keep talking until my lunch is over, even if G is not replying me when i text. 

We are also have a lot of personality clashes such that G is always annoyed with the littlest things. I dont even remember what are the little things.

I am writing this long ass story because i am really really at a loss at what to do from here on. I really love G and I really hope things will become better but I am really feeling bleak on this. I hope the kind community here can give me some advice to steer me towards a decision instead of being stuck in this limbo now. 

TL;DR : Got together with someone, many problems, need help.

Honestly speaking it sucks to have this curfew thing as both of us stay quite far from each other, 1 at west area and 1 at north-east area. We have alot of restriction due to the curfew such as no late night movie date and no staycation. We are also not allow to travel oversea for holiday as a couple even till now. 
During the courtship period we have arguments due to this issue and sometimes she brokedown and cried. But this doesn't stop us from being together, we tackle this issue together by planning our date to the smallest details and I make it a point to send her home every date/ outing, ensure she reach home before 10pm. Now I think back this continue for 3 years plus untill her parents started to know my existence and how I send her home everytime, even though we dont stay near each other. They started to be lenient by setting the curfew to 11~1130pm and lesser spam calls but I still make it a point to ensure she reach home by 10pm. Now we are engaged and getting married soon.

However, now I do not know if I should still put any hopes on him, as I still feel a bit afraid that he will ghost me again like 2 months ago. I am trying very hard not to think too much if he actually likes me or takes me just as a friend, because I do not want to have too high hopes on how we will progress and then end up being ghosted and emotionally hurt again. Any advice regarding this? Appreciate all!

950,"With my current partner for 3 years and both of us has graduated recently and have pretty decent careers. However, recently from social media and Instagram many of her seniors and peers have either gotten engaged or has gotten married. However I've just entered the corporate world with a pretty good career going on for me and don't see us settling down anytime soon. I have my own condo fully financed so bto isn't a need for us. Recently she started sending me pictures of babies and marriages and ideal wedding and rings and also talking about BTO locations. Yes like MAJOR hints. But I've also told her directly that marriage is on the cards for sure but not anytime soon.

How do I approach this lightly and let her know my thoughts. We've had this conversation multiple times and both agreed (verbally) that we'll work things at a later stage eventually since our career are at its critical stage. Both of us are are in our mid 20s.

Is it really that important to get married before 30s and stuffs. And wedding these days easily cost 50-200k which is a terrible financial decision imo. Could use any constructive feedback :)

951,"TLDR I’m a Y2 evergreen heterosexual guy, for quite some time now, I feel like I’m sexually attracted to women but emotionally attracted to men, and I’m not sure if this will be problematic, or is anything that should be fixed (because maybe it’s a sign of trauma or something).

I know I have no sexual attraction to men because I’m indeed only aroused by seeing women, not men. I’m not homophobic, I do recognise homosexuality as a sexual orientation (if I didn’t I wouldn’t even be discussing this topic, I want to know more). But what I do notice is when I develop feelings of romantic or emotional attraction with someone (“I really really want to be friends with this person/I really want this person in my life”), almost all the time it’s a guy (either straight or gay). And my brain seems to prioritise this emotional attraction over sexual attraction sometimes. Do note, I’m never “emotionally” attracted to the type of strong or macho men, it usually happens for people who are more in touch with their emotions and in my experience these guys really make good friends. Meanwhile sexual attraction-type crushes or eye candy happen with girls as they always have, but for a long time I have not met a girl I actually wanted to get to know or be friends with.

The strange thing is, granted this has happened very rarely but if a girl friend I consider “eye candy” is emotionally friendly to me, I suddenly stop finding them physically attractive, but I will still of course be emotionally in love with them and want them in my life. It’s like my brain has decided that a person’s emotional attractiveness and sexual attractiveness cannot coexist, and if a person is both emotionally and sexually attractive it somehow cancels out the sexual part. I suppose I might be bi, but it feels like a somewhat unusual form of bisexuality where emotional care and sex are on different ends of a binary.

I come from overseas and from a boys’ school so I don’t have any close girl friends in uni, only an entire bunch of guy friends. I don’t know if that has to do with anything, or which is the cause and which is the effect. Yeah in some sense I’m the stereotypical guy who has no girl friends, but for all I know it’s because my brain leads me to spend more energy pursuing friendships with guys? I have never clicked with a girl, much less felt any intense crush of wanting to be in a relationship with one (except next para).

In my life, I’m evergreen but had one experience of getting into a crush with a girl before my brain seemed to end up this way. It ended badly as a unrequited love/friendzoned story where my attraction (both emotional and physical at the time) was just used to take advantage of me, idk if that has any correlation either. I don’t experience trauma over it or feel bad about it, but I don’t know if it caused this change in me.

I’m concerned. Am I at risk of becoming like an incel, who sees girls as only sexual objects? If so, what can I do to avoid that happening - how much am I in a position to do? Is all this happening simply because my brain might have an emotional distrust of girls, perceiving them as unreliable friends or something, that I need to identify and fix? I don’t know if my lack of emotional attraction to girls is the result of suppressing it or I genuinely don’t feel any. And how can I ever get into a relationship if my brain seems to have decided that my emotional and sexual desires are to be fulfilled by different genders? It’s not really a life or death situation but just something really weird I wouldn’t dare to tell even my (guy) friends, lest they think I’m gay and attracted to them sexually, I might lose them too.

956,"I'm not sure what's wrong with me, but this problem has been bothering me since forever, secondary school iI suppose. And yall mus tbe wondering what problem I have. Well, it's just this super weird mentality. I can joke, diss, quarrel, hold hands with my mom on the streets and whatsoever with my family members but once they fall sick, or when things begin to fall lower than my expectations, I start to get a weird feeling.

For example, when they fall sick, I start to distance a way from them, regardless if it's my dad, mom or bro, but it's not that I'm scared that I'll start falling sick too. Or another example, when they cry in front of me, I'll just feel super awkward and try not to look into their direction. I don't know why, it just feels super weird to see my family members cry or fall sick that's a reason why I don't cry in front of people, unless of course when it cannot be controlled. I'm also hate letting others know that I'm sick whenever I fall ill so I'll just keep my mouth shut but due to the sudden personality change, people around me, including my friends, would discover it in no time. But it makes me feel like a weakling whenever any of that happens and I hate that feeling.

When my brother got into Pes E as he had a rare disease when he ws young, I sort of looked down on him too. I wanted him to be in commando or some cool squad. It just seems damn cool. Guys, chill, I'm not done yet, just in case you want to fire your comments on me.

I don't have all these problems with my friends though, it's just my dad, mom and bro. I don't look down on friends. Although when they are sick, I try not to expose them same as how I wouldn't want them to expose me when I'm sick, so I'll just act normal. Just to justify myself, I once lent my water bottle to my classmate on the first day or JC as she was coughing really badly, but I didn't drink from my bottle afterwards. Or when they cry, I don't judge them too. I really don't understand where did this mentality come from. As much as I want to change it, I can't. It's so difficult. I often admire how people can express their empathy towards family so easily but it just feels awkward for me. Help.

To those who have a full-time job: (excluding work trips) 
- How long do your trips usually last? / How many times per year?
- How do you get your employer to agree and approve your leave for your vacation plans (especially those that are longer than 2 weeks)? since usual companies only have a limited number of annual leave days. 
- How do you go on multiple vacations/trips per year without getting fired/ making your employer unhappy?
- How much of your salary (approx how many %) do you allocate as part of your travel budget?

I'm quite new to the travel scene and thus was wondering how people balance work and travel. I fear that taking trips (too often/ too long)  might result in an unhappy employer, subsequently leading to being let go from the job. Thank you to those who answered my queries (:

959,"To OP of 71717, 
I feel you. I too come from a family where I too feel that my parents were overprotective and I have never travelled overseas without my parents until the opportunity came up in NS as well. 
I would encourage you to go with the exercise as it really is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I too was happy that I got the opportunity to do so during my time in NS. While I framed it as an obligation to my parents then, I was more than happy to go for the detachment.
That being said, I think that as parents, they want the best of us and so they do not hope for us to come to any form of harm. So I think the best way to convince your parents is to assure them of your safety. The things you should tell them are: 

Firstly, you will be safe since you will be travelling in a group and that you will be looked out for by your fellow members of the group. 

Also, you will still be able to contact them to assure them of your safety. Not sure if your parents will demand that you call back or what but I think that it is still good to re-assure your parents by calling back every once in a while. However, you should make it clear that you may not be able to call back all the time or every day. 

You should also go and find out about a possible point of contact that your parents can contact you in case of emergency should anything happen back here. Each unit should have this number when they go for detachment. However, do make it clear to your parents that this is only for emergency uses. 

I think that more important than convincing your parents through reason, you should work on convincing your parents through action to show that you are ready to transition into someone that no need that much of their protection. For me, that meant helping out with some things in the household. 

Also, if you think about it, your going on a detachment could be further proof to your parents that you are no longer the kid that they think you were and who knows, probably they may relent on future instances where you need to go overseas. 

The thing is to get them to realise that you cannot be staying within the confines of their protection all the time. There will come a time where they need to let you go your way and they need to understand this as well. Give them time to be aware of this. 

Lastly, be patient and don’t think so negatively of your parents. I was once frustrated about how my parents were restrictive and at times felt suffocated (metaphorically) by them as well. 

However, I have since realised that the way every parent loves their children is different and learnt to focus on the positive things instead of the negative. After all, they are humans too and they too make mistakes. At each point in time, you are learning and growing and so are they. 

While I may not agree with them on certain things even till today, I am appreciative of all that they have done to raise me to who I am today. That does not mean that I have given up on the things that I do not agree with them on. I still try to voice my disagreements from time to time, but do it in a more respectful tone now. So stay strong and all the best????

Someone told me I needed to stop hanging around with guys and start hanging out with more girls. They are right.

I like having conversations but I feel like people are always talking about things that don't matter in life.

The issue is, most girls I met before, really only cared about guys or for some of my other girl friends, they preferred romance novels over hanging out with people, anytime of the day. When I start to be more openminded around girls (I hug people a lot) the more they start thinking I'm like a lesbian. I'm actually very straight. It's so restraining and confusing...

Like do girls really think every girl is a lesbian if they are just being comfortable around them?

Idk if its me being a bad friend or is it truly him being unreasonable.

But i have been keeping him company for nearly 2 weeks everyday and i know after his breakup once he finds a new girl he will ditch me and the plans he made to go hang out with the girl. Am i being a bad friend for being irritated at his antics and should be happy for him when he gets in a rs?

She and I are even planning to BTO once we start working and have our own financial means. She had quite a traumatic childhood and relationships. I do not want to elaborate on her childhood but it's something we would never wish on any child. She used to struggle with depression but went for counselling and gotten better. 

She has a history of harming herself whenever she perceives that she is at fault or punishes herself for some things. She doesn't do it as often and only does it whenever we argue where it ends up with her saying it's her fault. There are times when she says I am at fault too and I do agree on those and say my apologies. During those times, she never harms herself which I think it's because she doesn't have to 'punish' herself. 

I can't stop her from harming herself because she only tells me after she has done it. I don't know what to do and I feel hurt that she's doing that to herself but I feel so helpless and so sad. Would it be beter to end the relationship and let her learn to love herself more or should I stay? I'm at a loss

You see, she isn't exactly independent and is rather reliant on her family for many things. Lucky for her, her family is well to do and the community around their Balmoral condo gives her a sheltered but happy bubble to live in. She has made known her desire to stay near her parents after marriage many times.

Yet, I am of the more independent sort and would rather we live away from both of our parents. Even though both of our parents are rich enough to buy us a condo, I would rather we use our own money (not much on her part since her job isn't very high paying) and get a nice cosy BTO. Her parents agree with me, but my gf doesn't. When I told her about applying for the Bishan BTOs that were mentioned in the news this week, she kicked up a fuss about how that would be so far away from her friends living in Balmoral and Bukit Timah. She was also daunted by the prospect of leaving her current sheltered bubble, which was exactly the reason why her parents and I think we should get a BTO. After all, she isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer when it comes to dealing with people outside her sheltered bubble.

Needless to say, this housing issue is causing a strain in our relationship. She has also hinted that staying in a BTO is a line in the sand for her. After much persuasion, she was open to the idea of living in Bishan or somewhere equally convenient, but she insists on it being at least a condo. I love her very much, but I am afraid I am at my wits end dealing with her princess syndrome. Is there any way I can resolve this problem without jeopardising our relationship?

My results weren’t superb (& it was quite bad tbh) so whenever I applied for jobs that requires me to enter my University results, I would get eliminated even before I had the chance to go for an interview. I didn’t have the luxury of being a full time student. I need to work for my own allowances and school fees. But I know it’s not an excuse for not doing well.

On the outside, I seemed like a happy go lucky person but I guess no one will know how I truly feel. Doesn’t help when my family members keep asking me if I’ve gotten a job...... I am trying, really.

I had a friend who committed suicide recently because he couldn’t take adulthood. He lost it. When he landed his first job and he didn’t do well plus all the failed relationships he had along the way that sort of ruined him. Everything, literally everything just engulfed him at one shot. 

Don’t worry, I won’t give up on life. But I just want to shout to everyone who’s feeling down, disappointed or dejected - things will get better! It certainly will. Not now but eventually it will be better. Don’t give up on life. Think of your family, your friends and people whom you love.

976,"Hi I’d like to get some advice from you all. 

I’ll make it short. I’m a NUS alumnus. One of the (possibly) best things about my Uni life is meeting with this guy, who later became one of my close guy friends, whom I can confide in, especially when it comes to business, finance, relationship, life and stuff. Btw, we were from different faculties and we became friends after we first met for a CCA club. Later we found out on Facebook that we have quite a lot of mutual friends and our social circle is well connected. We had CCA meetings, gatherings, group outings, dance practices, and got closer to each other. We stayed in a NUS hostel (different blocks) and both enjoyed cooking. So, we didn’t run out of topics to text each other almost everyday during my year 1. We did more texting than meeting outside for just two of us. I could feel that he gradually showed some interest in me. Btw, I’m just an average looking lady but I think I’m sharp, hardworking, capable, kind, forward-thinking and very sociable. He is also smart, capable and average-looking (but I see him as a handsome guy). At times, he shared with me his past relationships. Maybe it was my mistake that I didn’t show him any obvious clues in return that I was also interested in him. 

So, he thought I didn’t like him and our texting became less frequent for a couple of months. We gave each other cold shoulders. Then I noticed he was chasing another younger girl and soon got into a relationship with her. We were still good friends but his then gf always speculated me and him whenever they quarrelled. To keep it short, they broke up after 2 or 3 years. (Disclaimer: the reason of their breakup was not related to me as I kept myself a distance from both of them. But he and I were still on talking terms as we had common activities.)

Some months later after his breakup, he texted me and we happened to catch up each other, and I could feel the same good old vibe being restored again. From that day on, we texted almost everyday though we were all occupied with our works and crazy schedules. Most of the things we talked about are no longer flirty, but rather sharing of each other’s life goals, career plans, family plans, finances and things that transformed us into mature individuals. Basically, both have turned into more capable individuals and started thinking about marriage — one of our common life goals. So, both are looking for a potential life partner to start a serious relationship with. He knows that I have some traits that make me wife material, and I also know that he is husband material. But we never talk it out directly to let each other know that we are the missing pieces for each other. We only show signals suggesting we can be a right match. 

So, the texting went on for a couple of months and I enjoyed it thoroughly. And just recently, I notice he’s become so caring towards me. He views my insta stories everyday and use them as a starter to chat with me. If he doesn’t initiate the conversation at our usual time due to his busy schedule, I then use his insta story to start chatting. 

Recently, he subtly hinted that we should meet up and catch up over dinner. So, we booked a date in advance for what both of us are available. 

Tbh, I’m in dilemma right now. Coz I’m not as hot as his ex-girlfriends, I want to know if he is really interested in me. If so, I’m ready to upgrade our relationship and go extra miles to fulfil each other’s goals. But if he is just flirting with me, I don’t want to waste my time for the wrong man. 

So, as a bystander, do u think he is interested in me? If so, in what ways should I deliver my signals that I’m also interested in him? Coz I heard that a guy tends to lose confidence and interest to pursue further if he doesn’t get any sign of assurance that the girl also likes him mutually. Btw, thank u in advance for any valuable advice ☺️

(which i'm totally fine with) the problem is why must i follow my bf everywhere when we aren't married yet? why must he drag me around knowing i'm very stressed out? what's the big deal of a best man turning up alone without a girl? this is not the first occasion where he ""forced"" me (i obliged to his persuasions in the end) to go for family/formal events. but why must i do the same for this situation when i am barely acquainted with the married couple?

You may say fast food is unhealthy and all but how is that different from eating char kway teow or nasi lemak 5x a week?

But here’s the thing: How do you guys purchase condoms at convenient stores without getting judged by the cashier aunty? Or how to avoid the awkwardness when someone whom you know is in the queue and sees what you’re buying e.g. irritating kid from next door.

988,"Here is my take on relationships for guys. I’m no love guru or anything but just try it and it’ll work.
Part of it is psychology, really.

1. Attraction is not a choice. The very first time you see and talk to her, you’ll know if you’re interested in her and vice versa. She’ll know if she’s interested in you. If you’re interested but she’s not, there’s nothing much you can do. Attraction can’t be forced. 
2.  Get straight to the point and be confident. Ask her out for a date. Don’t just text back and forth. What you want is a relationship, not a phoneship. When she asks what do you want to eat, pick a date, time and place. Don’t reply “Oh I don’t know, what do you like to eat?” She wants you to decide. So be direct and decisive. Never accept a “maybe” date. If she says maybe, tell her to figure out her schedule and get back to you. Don’t ask her a second time. She’ll contact you if she’s interested.  
3. Ask questions and build rapport. It shows that you’re interested in her, and she’ll know. Women are not dumb. They’ll know if you like them or not. Asking questions will let her know that you’re genuinely interested in her or not.  
4. After the first date, don’t ask her out for the next date straight away. To them, it shows that you’re needy and you got no options. Contact her maybe 3 days later and ask her out again. You may want to go out minimum once a week. Indirectly telling her you have things going on other than being crazy. (It’s psychology). 
5. Don’t text her often. Honestly, this is the most common mistake. Many guys go on texting through night and day, calling her on the phone and chatting for hours. Again, it’s a relationship you want, not a phoneship. Reply to her texts minimally and set a date. If she texts you, initiate a date. She won’t miss you if you keep blowing up her phone with texts and calls. How can you miss someone if they’re constantly in your face? Again, it’s psychology. 
6. When do you tell your feelings for her or know that she’s interested in you? Listen to her. There are signs. If she “accidentally” bumps into you, it means she’s feeling comfortable with you and doesn’t mind getting closer to you.  But just don’t say “I love you” first. Let her say it. And then you reciprocate.  
7. When is the best time to ask her for an official relationship? Well, look for signs again. She’ll ask, “Where is this going?”. Well, don’t answer by saying “Oh you want a relationship?” Ask her back. Ask her, “ what do you mean ?” And then she’ll elaborate further. Again, ask her questions. Let her elaborate further. She might go along the lines with “We’ve been going out for awhile and I’m just wondering what’s our status.”  Then you’ll know what’s up. 
8. Don’t ask her about her past relationships. Whatever happened in her life doesn’t concern you. She’s going out with you and that’s it. When you ask about her past relationships or ask if she like someone else, you’re telling her you got no value. “Oh, you dated someone better than me? I hope I meet your standards, etc.”  
9. Don’t go telling her about your life story. Always ask her questions. Women like men who are mysterious. It’s like watching a movie and there’s a cliffhanger. They like the anticipation and finding out what you’re all about. If you tell her your whole life story, there’s nothing much for her to discover. 
10. If there are times that she doesn’t reply to you as frequently as before, it tells me that you’re constantly chasing her. I can’t stress this enough, women are like cats. They come and go as they please. If you’re constantly texting her, she’ll get bored. Stop texting her. If she likes you, she’ll come back.  
11. Never argue with a woman. There’s a reason why people say “Women are always right.” When you argue with a woman, it means you don’t understand them. Don’t even bother to reason with them.  
12. Women will ALWAYS test you. ALWAYS. From the the courtship to the relationship phase. Trust me, even if they say they don’t, they do. They’ll purposely make you mad to see if you get mad. Or whatever means to tick you off. Even not replying you for awhile just to see if you’re needy. But that’s just women. Don’t ever get mad. Just play it cool and don’t take things personally. 
13. When she’s mad. She’ll test you. When you ask her to talk , she’ll say “No, I don’t wanna talk about it. I’m not angry at all. There’s no point in talking.” It’s her way of testing if you truly care about her. Dig in deeper, make her laugh. Always use humour. Joke and banter with her till you she says why.  Don’t bother reasoning out with her why she’s wrong during this phase. Just make her laugh and she’ll feel way better. 
14.  Reference to step 13. Be wary of women who stonewall you. These are the people with attitude and are red flags. Whatever ways you tried to joke with her and make her talk but she still refuses to talk. It’s a huge red flag. Imo, they are manipulative as hell.  
15. Once you guys are together, then you can slowly tell her your life story. But do it with a positive spin to it. Example, sharing with her about your past girlfriend,” Oh i broke up with her because she was a egoistic, manipulative, self-centred bitch.” It’ll come as a turn off. Do it with a positive spin for example, “It was pretty unfortunate but I’ve learnt a lot during the past relationship. We just weren’t compatible.” Simple as that :) 
16. Don’t go around pleasing a woman. Please. Don’t drop what you’re doing just to please her. If she’s mad with you for not returning texts immediately and start doing it, trust me, she’ll stop returning your texts after awhile. Have a backbone. Continue with your purpose. Having a purpose is what attracts them actually.  This is as much as I can think of for now. Final tip, don’t chase women. Have them chase you. You just have to chase them during the first 3 dates. Initiate texts and asking out for dates. After that, she’ll text you, wondering if you’re interested in her, and then you can ask her out on a date.  Those romantic films you watch, where you gotta buy her flowers, do all the romantic things and hope one day she’ll fall in love. They don’t work in real life. Never buy her gifts unless she’s your girlfriend.  You don’t see men like James Bond chasing women with flowers etc. Be confident, maintain eye contact and engage in a genuine conversation. Get to know her more. Most part of it is just psychology. That’s why most women go after “ bad boys “ and not the “ nice guys “. This is it. If there are 9 men chasing her with flowers and you just act cool with the tips, she’ll probably blow the other 9 guys off. Many women will disagree on this but this what they’re naturally attracted to. Good luck ;)

This girl and I met during camp. She had a bf then, but we still texted and met quite often. One day, I confessed to her and she broke down. She felt happier with me and had feelings for me. But what was holding her back from her ex was time(they were together for 2years). To be honest, I was prepared to leave because I dont want to be a third party. 
For the next 2 months, we spent almost every day together(except Saturday and Sunday). The time we spent together, we did share intimate moments(kiss, hugs etc). When she was sick, I would buy medication for her. I would also often buy her favourite food etc. Even when we eat out, I would often pay for our meal. During these 9 weeks, she eventually broke up with her bf. 
So, after 1 weekend, everything changed. Her replies got slower(this was not the same week she broke up with her bf). We had a lot of quarrels about texting etc. She didn’t care as much. There were a lot of red flags, but I chose to believe what she told me. Another week past and I went to find her (she stays in school). The usual bought her favourite food etc, hoping to surprise her. I was in her room for about 40minutes (which she knew cause I texted her) before she came back from her friend’s room. I confronted her about the whole situation and if she liked someone else. After much hesitation, she said yes. My heart sank.  
Till now, I still cannot comprehend the situation. How can someone change of heart so fast? After all the vulnerable moments we shared together. She barely knew the guy, but she already chose to forget everything that happened? I had so many plans; her birthday, after exams etc. But I guess it’s all a waste now. 
I know that time will heal everything but as of now, thoughts of suicidal are constantly in my mind, especially since I know she is enjoying her time with him. After everything that happened, I just feel like I was being used. I tried distracting myself by studying but I cant concentrate. I often skip meals these days cause I just don’t have the appetite. Sometimes I feel like being the nice guy doesn’t get you girls.

He was straightforward when confessing his feelings, and I was blown off my feet not knowing what to expect in my first relationship; because of our age gap we hid our relationship. We could only meet in his home, or drive around aimlessly, & what else can you do in these places....

This went on for a year until i found out that i was a third party. I was shocked, and betrayed, but mostly found fault in myself for being so gullible to a man’s sweet talk.  

I avoided him for weeks but my determination to stay away wavered as he confessed that he was out of love with her - and only stayed due to her suicidal tendencies. Well, who am i to stop someone in a situation like this? Yet my heart still longs for him. 

It didn’t help that we still met occasionally due to mutual friends. In the silence and distance, i would still grab his hand whenever he holds it out to me. A cycle of attraction, guilt and heartbreak - at least for me. 

At the back of my mind, i was always suspicious of his real intentions. Was he lying to me? Was i being used? How many more secret relationships is he hiding?

Eventually i couldn’t take this overthinking and completely shut him off my life - even after a year, when he reached out to say he has finally been freed from his relationship. 

Not long after, our mutual friends told me that he wasn’t ok, almost depressed even, and they didn’t know why. All this while, i didn’t dare believe that it was because i left - because he had so much going on for him, and i really didn’t feel like i was much of a priority in his busy schedule. 

This all happened a few years back. I’ve mostly moved on but once in a blue moon, certain events still trigger memories and erupt unpleasant uncertainties in myself. I guess i never got the closure i needed, nor know for sure if my first love was an unfortunate love story or a miserable lie. Maybe the worst part is, i could never breathe a word about this to anyone i know. 

I have zero intent of getting back together, yet i don’t know why this bugs me so much... genuine thoughts & advice appreciated.

1023,"This is a continuation from https://www.NUSWhispers.com/confession/71503

I feel like my sister is the one pulling the strings. My parents favour her more and would even seek advice from her. She would always try to put me in a bad image and talk as if she’s great in front of my parents. I don’t know why she’s doing this but recently she has been talking about BTO and hinting my parents to pay for her, so maybe that’s why. Once she asked me what I thought about her fiancé and I asked her why. She said it’s because he will become a part of the family in the future and have a bigger standing (my sister is older than me) than me and my girlfriend. 

Honestly I couldn’t take it anymore a few months back and have tried to avoid contact with them. Me treating them well will only backfire. I would give them 1 word replies and no longer buy stuff for them or bring them out. My mom is the only one who cares about me and asked me why I changed but I didn’t tell her. I think my father and sister noticed but they haven’t done anything. So far I feel that it’s better this way for my mental health. But I have a bad feeling that my sister have ‘won’ and this might have been what she wanted. 

Unfortunately I’m still a student so it would still be awhile before I can move out.

1024,"Hi everyone, I think I need some help. I think I'm sick, like sick in the head. Like i think i have an unhealthy obsession with girls. All my life my experiences with the opposite gender have been very limited, like I can literally count with one hand the number of girls who were at any one point friends with me (my hand has 5 fingers if you were wondering). It's probably cos I have always been in male-dominated environments and also because I am too shy to even interact properly, even with guys. So I guess that's how unrealistic fantasies about girls have developed. It certainly doesn't help that I think girls are some of the most beautiful things on the planet. In school, I always get uncontrollable urges to stare at girls, simply because they have such beautiful faces/figures/legs/skin/etc. I also really wanted to join those telegram groups like SG nasi lemak cos i have so much pent up horniness, and the only reason i didn't was cos I didn't want to reveal my identity to anyone in those groups. Only after the outcry about sg nasi lemak did I start to wake up my idea and realise my thoughts may be quite unhealthy. 

So yeah i think i need some help to stop being obsessed with girls. I'm quite scared that i might be the next nus student appearing on the news for you know what. How do i treat girls as normal people, and how do i establish healthy relationships (friendships for now) with girls?

1031,"I just don't really get the concept of modern dating. Especially with the emergence of online dating apps, there are just too many options and many people are dating more than 1 person at any one time. 
Having gotten out of a few bad relationships in the past, I went to on to experiment with online dating apps, thinking that maybe dating / talking to a few people at a time would be kind of fun and would allow me to form better judgements since I would not be blinded to only one person that may be a bad fit. However, eventually I decided that the concept of ""dating a few people at once"" doesn't sit well with me. I don't get how is that will work out cause I think it gives the illusion that you have so many other backup options that you needn't put in much effort in any one of them? And it eliminates the fear of failure?
So I deleted the app after finding one guy that I decided to focus on. We went on a few dates and we do like each other, though we are both not ready and not sure enough to commit for a serious relationship yet. But the problem is, even though I am dating him exclusively, he is dating a couple of others because he too, had a couple of bad relationships in the past and now he is not sure of what he wants yet and doesn't want to settle down easily. I understand what he means because it makes logical sense but I couldn't help feeling upset that I am not the only one he is dating. It's like I am feeling special at one moment, but the feeling disappeared and was replaced with a heartache when I  remembered the fact that I am not the only one! 
I am having so many inner conflicts between my heart and my mind now. Should I stick around with him and date other people too (I mean that's practical right?) Should I continue dating him exclusively, give my best shot to it and accept it if it doesn't work out in the end, or just drop it and find somebody else who is willing to focus on only me and give me a shot?
I really think that this modern dating world is kind of screwed up. People nowadays are getting more picky and afraid of commitment to the extent that it's so difficult to find a partner now, isn't it? Or maybe I am the delusional one who is willing to put myself out there to get hurt.

My ex at that time was manipulative although loving but i didn't want to continue being with him. Fortunately, managed to break things off with him.

1047,"Hi fellow peers, there's something that I'm a little curious and maybe slightly bothered about. So a little context here: I am a lesbian and I have a close heterosexual male friend who has a very jovial and friendly personality whom I hang out and chat with often. He knows I'm not interested in guys, but have expressed that he has found me cute and calls me babe or cutie sometimes. I'm inclined to believe it's just his personality and how he gets close to people easily (with both guys are girls). Some of the stuff he says could be interpreted as a little suggestive, like dirty jokes and stuff. But is that normal because I'm like a ""bro""? I can't pinpoint what, but I get the impression that he thinks he can make me straight or bring out the feminity in me sometimes. 

He also has a strong gym body and is proud about it and gives off the alpha male vibe as well, which I don't think very well of because I think it's really egoistic to feel attracted to girls whom you can dominate and lose interest in girls when they are capable enough to surpass you. One of the dominant moves I felt from him is his habit of giving the back of my neck a squeeze (I've never seen him do it to anyone else) every now and then. I do try to avoid physical contact from him, but only when I can do it without being obvious because I don't want him to think I see him as some predator. Another thing is that he comments on some of the things I do as cute (I find that annoying because it's really like calling the things I do for the goals and causes I really believe in to be kiddy). He's also the kind whose ideal type is someone he can show care and protection to, and I don't like the idea that he might see me as his type because I see myself as rather independent and have ambitious goals. Like omg, even if I like guys, I won't want to limit myself to strive for my ambitions less just so as to be careful not to make you seem less like a man around me; that mentality irks me. Nevertheless, we are good friends as I don't think some disagreement with how we think should make us enemies as we do get along mostly and he's been a really helpful senior. I ever thought that if I show that I can be a more capable person than him, I could see if his perspective of me could change. But ambitious as I am, he is a really capable guy with good grades and future prospects and I don't see myself outshining his achievements anytime soon if ever. 

Ok, sorry for the long context. So anyway, recently, we went to the gym together and he tagged me in an instastory doing some exercise (with only my ig handle and no other text). When we both went home, he showed me a screenshot of his instastory statistics (I think it's only available if you register your Instagram profile as a business account) which showed that I have a few dozen sticker clicks on my Instagram handle, showing me how so many people were ""interested in me"". There was also 1 share, which I inquired about but he didn't address it when it got buried under another conversation we were having. A few hours later, he then sent me an update showing how the number of clicks on my Instagram handle has gone up by about another dozen. I do see myself as a rather open-minded person, and think it's natural to compliment me on my looks if they appeal to him. I am proud of my physique and fitness after all (I'm not the massive kind, just the lean muscle kind of person who does mostly calisthenics). I do feel kind of bothered somehow though, but I'm not sure if it's because I'd never posted about my gym sessions or ever do selfies myself, or whether it's something else. I never did express any objection when we filmed me on his instastory though, so I can't blame him for anything.

Anyway, that's the end of my story guys. Thanks for reading. Some of the thoughts that have gone through my head are: ""Is he interested in me and believes I can somehow 'awaken' my interest in guys one day? Or is he just super friendly?"", ""Is there any meaning behind him scruffing my neck and cracking dirty jokes with me? Should I be allowing it to continue? I haven't heard anything misogynistic so far and can live with it if there's no harm done."", ""Am I bothered because I don't think well of the alpha male mentality, or because I feel objectified somehow or treated like a child somehow?"", ""What the hell does scruffing someone's neck even mean? I've never seen anyone do that to anyone else in my whole 22 years of life"".

I think I'm thinking too much, but I'd like to hear from what everyone else thinks of this. I also would like to think that it isn't a crime to simply admire something from afar even if it's something that wouldn't ever be yours. So anyway, prove me wrong or confirm my doubts so that I can stop thinking about this altogether. My utmost appreciation for your genuine inputs on the matter.

1052,"Early last year, I met this guy through a mutual friend and we clicked instantly. Back then he just moved back to Sg after working overseas for a while, to help out with his family business. We eventually got together, and that was when he opened up more and I started noticing that I wasn’t comfortable with his lifestyle and habits. I found out that apparently he wasn’t doing much for the business and pretty much bummed around the whole day. He also spent many sleepless nights playing poker and boasted to me how his few days of earnings from poker can even exceed my monthly salary. He’s from a very rich family and basically behaved like a spoiled kid even at his age (late 20s). He bought me expensive meals and gifts but I knew it was either using his parents’ money or from gambling and it made me feel uneasy. I broke up with him after a few months for all these reasons and he was furious, as he accused me of not loving him enough to give him chance to improve before dumping him. Vicious words were exchanged, and the immature way he handled the breakup (he even threw my phone across the room) made me hate him even more. 

Few weeks after the breakup, he started contacting me again, thanking me for teaching him an important lesson despite all the hurt and he said he’s working towards becoming a better person. Soon, he shared with me that he had secured a decent job. He stopped gambling completely and spent the time working out and learning new skills instead. He sent me gifts on my birthday and souvenirs from his holiday trips. Again and again he expressed his appreciation to me for inspiring him to lead a more fulfilling life and saying how badly he wanted to see me now. However, never once did I respond to him. Even when we happened to bump into each other once and he called my name several times, I pretended not to see him. My heart was still cold remembering the spoiled kid that he used to be, I refused to believe that he indeed has changed.

Fast forward about 1.5 years to today, he still contacts me from time to time. I guess time really heals, I no longer have bad feelings for him now. In fact I felt kinda guilty for ignoring him all these while. So I was just thinking whether it’s weird if I suddenly respond to him now (he just texted again recently), apologise for my lack of response so far etc and try to be friends with him? Should I be open to the idea of starting a relationship with him all over again if he’s still keen, now that he’s a changed person? My worst fear is that he’ll go back to his old ways one day and disappoint me again, am I thinking too much here?

1055,"The first time I ever tasted a fresh French baguette was on 31 Aug this year. Ever since then, I’ve had this insatiable craving for them. Night or day, all I can think about is baguettes..

I’m wondering has anyone else felt like this before? I’m afraid of telling my friends or family because I know they will judge me or think I’m joking, but I’m not. It’s been really stressful trying to hide my baguette addiction from them. I almost got exposed when I brought a baguette with me everyday to my group projects, and my friends asked me what’s my problem. Since then I’ve only eaten them in secret, usually I will go to one of the toilets in BIZ1 because they’re quite private.

Anyway, I wish the cafes in school would sell baguettes! It’s really troublesome bringing one with me to school every morning, especially when the trains and busses are so crowded. Sometimes people give me a nasty look because they think I’m poking them with something, but it’s really just my bread. 

It’s really stressing me out, and I don’t know what to do about this. Should I see a doctor?

1060,"Ever since I left Singapore for an overseas exchange programme, my Singaporean BF has been taking a long time to respond to my texts. Eventually, I gave up and found another guy (non-Singaporean) who is studying in the same university. I moved in with him last weekend. Everything seems to be going well, so after much deliberation, I have made my final decision: I am going to break up with my singaporean Bf.

The problem is this: when I left for exchange, my Singaporean BF transfered me a sum of money for rent and living expenses. Since I intend to break up with him, should I return his money? On one hand, it feels weird to be using an ex's money. On the other hand, my personal finances are quite tight right now, and even though my non-singaporean BF does not charge me rent, I still need to spend quite a bit on living expenses. Maybe I should return some % of the money and keep the rest? I have been overseas for approximately 2 months. The entire exchange programme lasts approximately 10 months. So I should keep 20% of the money and return 80%?

1063,"As an alumnus, just wanna remind NUS students not to settle for a low paying job just because (everyone tells you) the market is bad or because you are getting anxious from seeing others securing offers. Don't settle for less than what you think you deserve. Take your time. Go for one with decent pay. Many would tell you that starting salary isn't important and what is more important is the experience you can gain. I would say that both are equally important; Starting salary is important because your next employer would use it as a benchmark for how much they are offering you. When searching for your next job, imagine a candidate whose current salary is only 10% less your asking salary while another candidate’s salary is 30% less than your asking salary. Employers are more inclined to deem the former's request as reasonable and try negotiate it down with the latter because a 30% raise seems more unreasonable.
Also, if you choose a job that pays you say, $300 less than your peer, you take an additional two years for your pay increment to match up to theirs. And this discrepancy of income continues because they're likely to have increment over the two years as well. Not forgetting that you’re also losing out in your bonuses.
TLDR: Don't let employers lowball you if you have the skillset to demand a higher pay. Do not settle for less than what you think you are worth.

1064,"For the past 4 days, it has been tough for me to swallow my feelings up after my break up. This sadness has been eating my insides and my mind, giving me great grief and regret for not making our relationship official earlier. 
My girlfriend had dumped me as she said: ""if our relationship is not official, I take it as you don't want to commit into our relationship.""  Does commitment into a relationship has to be represented by our official identities? 
I promised her that I would make it official once I am able to cope with my studies at the end of the semester. The fact that we are not official gave her a sense of insecurity although I have spent my time to be together with her and do whatever I can to make plans with her every day and every week to sustain our relationship.
As time goes on, she started to be cold to me. She has lost her enthusiasm in me and she started rejecting my invitation from time to time. I asked her why and she replied that she was busy with her exams and assignments. I do understand that and thus I try to make time for her whenever she's available. 
After numerous plans and numerous rejections , I have started to catch her hanging out with another friend of mine on a daily basis. I thought it was not a big deal until she begin to refuse to go out with me just to join that friend during her free time. I wanted to talk about this but I felt like it was childish. For example, in one afternoon during her break, I asked her out for lunch and she refused by saying that she went out with her coursemates. Coincidentally, I bumped into the two of them (both from different courses) walking back from lunch and that hurt me like mad, I was confused. Why did she cheat me just to join him? She could've been honest with me when I asked her.
One month later, she broke up with me leaving me with grief for not making our relationship official and at the same time instilling jealousy inside me. I was depressed, sleep deprived, lacked focus and it all got worse when I saw them happily together going out together for outdoor activities.
I felt like shit, even up till now. I have put in my effort , time and my own trust into this relationship and it ended in the most most MOST misserable way. I can't bottle up these feelings any longer. I feel betrayed.
Does loving someone can only be allowed when the relationship is official? Don't you ever feel guilty sometimes for pushing me away for someone else while I'm here needing your love and attention?

1067,"I feel extremely lonely. I have friends, close friends, with whom I hang out. I am reasonably social. I take part in CCAs and stuff.  But I crave for something more than friendship. It’s not sex but more like intimacy and exclusivity. Even when I am in a crowd or hanging out with my friends I feel lonely. 

Background - I have only been in one relationship that lasted a couple of months in 2016. I am a virgin and I haven’t dated anyone since. 

My issue is even when I hang out with my friends, especially female friends, I always have this feeling that we will never be more than friends, since most of them are already attached. I feel like I am the only one with nobody in my life, nobody consistent. That my life has no stability because of it.  And that makes me feel miserable. 
I’ve tried to distract myself from this feeling by focusing on studies, hobbies etc but it does not last. I can’t keep it up anymore. This loneliness is killing me. 

Sometimes I even contemplate taking my own life and when I think of that the first question that comes to mind is ‘would anyone really miss me if I did it?’ and for a long time I’ve tried to convince myself that there are people in my life who would miss me but I am not entirely sure I can keep up this lie. And if the day comes where I can no longer convince myself that someone would miss me then I am fairly confident that, that is the day I will end up killing myself. 

My question is what can I do about it. It’s a very specific problem. I just want someone in my life who I care about, who cares for me, with whom I am exclusive with. I want to feel loved and secure, something that cannot happen with just friendship. 

I have tried dating apps but with no success. I find it so meaningless and tiring and I hardly get any matches and even those who do match hardly ever reply. I don’t even know if getting into a relationship is the right move at this point, even if someone ever wanted to date me, because I feel like now I am more in love with the idea of a relationship than with the person I would be in a relationship with. 

What do I do? I want to stop feeling this way. I can’t go on living miserable like this.

In my attempt to reduce/reuse my usage of paper, I asked my lecturer if she would be okay with me submitting hardcopy assignments using rough paper (i.e. useless paper that is printed on ONE side) and she actually said yes! So friends, try asking your teachers if they allow you to print submissions with used paper - pretty sure most will say yes because of recent pressure over climate change etc. No harm asking. When there is a will, there is a way.

Also, as someone who jots down notes on paper instead of on computer, I have switched from writing it on notepads to writing it on used rough paper, and then filing them up afterwards. So for those still writing on foolscap or notebooks, u can consider writing lecture notes on rough paper. (I have lots of rough paper at home, that's why.

So, here's the thing. He is more high drive than me. I have no qualms giving it to him when he ask for it. And when I say no he respects that. 
The thing is, because he is more high drive, he initiates it more often (like 99% of the time?) and I rarely initiates it. Not that I don't have a desire for it. But, Because the frequency (of his initiation) is already higher than my frequencies of desires, that’s why I rarely initiate it. 
So, for me sex is not as exciting now cos it is done without me having an internal ""desire"". We just do sex but I am not able to give my best because internally I am not “fired up”. 
I don’t think he would like it if I reduce the frequency, but I honestly think it wld help with that part of our life because it would get me more excited and involved and perform better?
Does anyone have a similar problem of varying sex drive and how to deal with it? Am I right to ask to reduce the frequency or shld I just continue with the flow?

1097,"In response to OP of #71083, 

I hope this response is not too late for you. 
I think I am in a very similar situation with your sister, with the same diagnosis.
I also withdrew from my friends because I found it very hard to trust people because of personal experiences. There was a long period of time when I did not feel like meeting up with anyone,  but sort of forced myself to do so some times because I don't think it solved problems. Fortunately, it is not the case now.

Many times, I don't understand myself. In fact, every moment, I am trying to make sense of myself. It is an extremely frustrating route. At least for her, counselling helps, but for me, it works to a limited extent. Perhaps that very advice the counselor provided your sister with has been the answer she is seeking for desperately in a sea of unanswered questions, hence she has been sticking to it faithfully. Perhaps, it even eases her anxiety and makes her feel a little happier and at ease - something she has not been experiencing for a long time.

Many times, the things we do don't make sense to people. I am equally guilty of not explaining in detail to others my actions, because 1) I doubt others will understand because they are not in my shoes, regardless of how much they care for me 2) I don't even know for sure what is happening to myslef, how am I going to explain to others? 

There is no use in using logic because it will worsen the situation. In fact, I realise I have been very sensitive to people who did it and many times, the words they uttered made me feel more stressed, anxious and useless. 

I read a comment that said that we are self-entitled. I admit that I am, and your sister may be too, depending on how you see it. Perhaps, the self-entitlement comes from us not explaining in full what happened to us, hence it seems that we are doing anything we want without considering others. But, it can also be seen as a strategy to cope with ourselves, ableit logically, not a long-term one.

I cannot say for sure that your sister is experiencing the exact same feelings as me, but I hope it will let you understand her better. 

Like what commentors have raised, I recommend you to meet/contact her counselor to find out more about your sister's condition. Even better if you can consult him/her together to close the communication gap. 

I realised that anxiety and depression may last for a long time, perhaps even a life time, as a relapse can happen so unprecedentaly and mood swings seem to be unavoidable. Hence, it is even more important for you to be by her side. 

I wish for your family to understand how to treat her better, and for your sister to feel better overtime. Also, be prepared to face more unpredictable problems in near future, especially if her trigger is studies and she has yet to complete hers. 

I am very glad that your sister took LOA because I really regret not taking one when my anxiety was at its peak. Seeing the counselor and taking LOA are signs that she is helping herself and not letting herself slip further into this incoherent mental mess, which is important in tackling with such issues. 

Hopefully, we will find answers and solutions to this incoherent mess one day. 

Meanwhile, I hope that the general public can be more open to us. I am fortunate enough to meet many people who helped me along but I am still struggling. I cannot imagine people in the same situation who don't.

1099,"In response to OP of #71083, 

I hope this response is not too late for you. 
I think I am in a very similar situation with your sister, with the same diagnosis.
I am also withdrawing from my friends, especially my uni friends because I find it very hard to trust people because of personal experiences. There was a long period of time when I did not feel like meeting up with anyone,  but sort of forced myself to do so some times because I don't think it solved problems. Fortunately, it is not the case now.

Many times, I don't understand myself. In fact, every moment, I am trying to make sense of myself. It is an extremely frustrating route. At least for her, counselling helps, but for me, it works to a limited extent. Perhaps that very advice the counselor provided your sister with has been the answer she is seeking for desperately in a sea of unanswered questions, hence she has been sticking to it faithfully. Perhaps, it even eases her anxiety and makes her feel a little happier and at ease - something she has not been experiencing for a long time.

1109,"Hi OP #71206,

Entertainment websites or applications are addictive because they provide us with instant gratification. They hook us further by misleading us with the perception that virtual badges or titles would help to increase our social worth, and thus, offer us a perceived increase in our self-esteem -- helping us to feel better and cope with situations that we deem ugly. However, badges -- like the ""Top Fan"" badge -- are bankrupt accessories if you think about it. They only reflect the lost time spent on social media and nothing more. Think, rationalise: how has this badge helped in your self-development?

To dilute your addiction, I'd suggest engaging in activities that you enjoy to make you an even more wholesome individual although I’m pretty sure you’re one already :)! You can go for painting classes, do sports, head for a coffee workshop… yada yada… there're just too many to list! For me, I deactivate my IG account periodically (every winter/summer vacation) to remind myself that time is too precious to be wasted on social media. Just last summer, I met up with a friend to do kayaking, met up with another to watch a performance at Esplanade, read 2 books, wrote a poem with a flamboyant friend, met up with a Prof for afternoon tea and to discuss about writing conference papers, etc., etc., ...

Anyway, if you need a social-media-detox buddy, I’m right here for ya! We can deactivate our accounts any time and engage in some healthy, enjoyable (non-illicit) activities!

Cheers,

1130,"I recently attended a reunion session with a few of my NS platoon mates, including the sergeants and lieutenants who were with us during our mandatory service period.

Throughout the session, some of the sergeants and lieutenants shared that they had dreams of furthering their education in universities, but are unable to do so because they either lacked good grades or needed to be financially stable as soon as possible (because their family isn't well to do). For one particular lieutenant, he shared that he came from a broken family and had to help his mum with taking care of the children and family chores during his primary school time. And because of that, he wasn’t able to keep up with his studies – thus, performing below average for his PSLE and O levels. This carried on to his JC life where he had to work part-time to support his mother and siblings. Moreover, he also shared that he felt ‘tremendously envious’ of his university friends whenever they were talking about their school assignments, CCAs, project work, and other academic stuff that he would never be able to experience in person. Upon hearing that, a part of me felt really guilty because I’ve always complained about my tertiary life without ever thinking once about the people who had to forgo their study opportunity because of their family circumstances. It was such an emotional story that a few of us had trouble holding back our tears…

Tbh, I’m so grateful to have attended the reunion session right now because I’ve learnt to see education as a privilege rather than an entitlement. My only regret is that I wish this realisation could have come earlier… 

So for those who are struggling in university (like me) or are crumbling under the academic pressure (like me again), please don’t give up and know that there will always be people rooting for you by your side! If you’ve none, I’ll be your first! Please cherish this study opportunity/privilege that you have! ????

Would like to have your advice and inputs for my concern below.

I am interested in the UX/UI, multimedia/graphics/illustrator etc field. Is it advisable to take up a degree in Computer Science in local uni or take up a Multimedia/Graphic course etc in private uni?

As I'm not sure if the field I am interested in are suitable for me or something I would enjoy in the long run and also in terms of the availability of the job opportunities/salary. Hence I thought of studying computer science would be more advisable as it is considered general IT degree and will be able to apply to the UX/UI, multimedia/graphics/illustrator etc field too? (Please correct me if m wrong)

However if I choose to take up a multimedia/graphic course etc, if in the future I am not keen anymore or would like a career switch to other areas in IT. The degree I get might not be able to allow me to jump to other areas in IT.

I feel I am not technically as strong as I do not have a programming background and I don't think I am a fast learner. If I take up the computer science course, would it tough for me to catch up. What should I do?

I met this girl recently and we can talk almost endlessly when we are in person, but she's almost non existent when texting, replying me once a day and when I ask her out she's never free.

Should I try harder or just give up on this girl?

1144,"What are your views on dating an unambitious guy? My boyfriend is one such happy go lucky guy. In school, he would put in minimum effort and just scrap through with a 2nd lower. Now he has been working for a year, he has no intention of working hard and aim for a promotion or go into some management next time. He is not 100% lazy, he would just do what is required of him and remain in his comfort zone. He is unlikely to change as he is always like this since he was a child. I don't know how this will affect our future if we were to settle down. Should I just accept for who he is? Am I worrying too much?

As a prereg, I realise that my colleagues keep talking about empowering patients and letting them take charge of their health, or something along the lines of ""we should be role models for our patients"", but all these are so hard to achieve. I mean, just look at the number of patients out there who think that they are smarter than us and challenge us with our therapy recommendations. Like I dont even see my role as a community prereg pharmacist anymore if patients continuously ignore my advice and engage in unhealthy activities. No wonder my preceptors rather use their mobile phones than talk to their patients. To be honest you all will fare better if you work elsewhere. Even better, go into other profession like selling insurance or becoming a childcare facilitator. At least the toddlers are easier to manage than the adults coming to your local pharmacy. So glad that I have the choice to choose another profession after my prereg training concludes at the end of this year.

I'm content with my single lifestyle, having hobbies that I can immerse myself in and a small group of close friends that I usually hang out with. 

However, I am starting to wonder if I am missing out on major milestones. A lot of people in NUS seem to be attached, and from what I know, many people of my age have dated at least once. Sometimes my friends would share stories of their significant other, while I would quietly and cluelessly listen (because of obvious reasons. lol).

While I am open to the idea of dating a girl while studying, I am not actively looking for a partner (not that it makes a difference; I don't club nor drink so maybe people would perceive me as boring? I don't know how clubbing is fun but that's a separate issue altogether). I did try Tinder just for the sake of having dating experience, but I deleted the app the next day after downloading it because it felt way too toxic for me (I don't know why sugar daddies are so popular among girls there but... sure).

Is anyone experiencing the same thing as me? I wonder if I would still be single till I die...

1153,"My sister who's been going for therapy for depression and anxiety recently told me that she's learned that it's ""better"" to just look out for yourself. She blames us for trying to help her and not expect appreciation in return (e.g. we cook a meal for her, and she does not like the meal, scolding us for trying to think for her; or wake her up to remind her of an appointment and she gets mad that we would try to force her awake when she could have just missed her appointment since she was too tired anyway). She is almost entirely convinced that there is no obligation to help another if you do not feel like it, and there is nothing that should infringe that personal right. 

I could argue by logic and try to convince her, but she is pretty adamant about her new world view. And her therapist says she is making progress. The only issue is that she is now further from the family than before because of her newfound views and while I encourage her to find her own life outside (to truly live out her ideals), she obviously is not ready - she is on LOA, she has no job and she does not want to work (because it is something that she does not want to do and no one can tell her what to do) (and my parents will never bear to let her truly be independent without a stable job, good grades etc)

Is there a way to solve this or am I wrong and this actually is not a problem?

1156,"I have been in a relationship with my bf ever since half a year now. I've understood that he is a goal oriented and intellectual man and those were the things that made me love him even more. On our first few months he was quite agressive for being sweet and attentive to me. Always making sure he replies to my messages and attends to my concerns. He is a very sweet guy hence I fell even more. We matched when it comes to intellectual conversations as well as simple ones too. And we've travelled to quite some places already around asia and will be planning to go to a lot more. In fact have booked our upcoming holidays too.

But just about 2 months now, he's been indulging himself with so much studies and stress that I still try my best to cheer on him. He's on his university studies and while I'm working, I am fully dedicated to waiting for him to finish studies and we can start building our lives together.

The thing is, he is so busy. Straight up ???? % attentiveness now to just 10%.. I don't know what happened to him but he often just seenzones my messages for the whole day, and he still wouldnt agree to post our photos online... Its been months since we started dating and I would always wonder why he wouldnt post our couple photos. He does say he love me and is pretty invested on me. And I would like to just believe it. Cause requiring him a lot would mean additional stress with his studies right?

I have tried to fit myself to him and his standards as per his request, but now that he's busy, I only asked for him to post our photos as a sign to let people see he is busy + committed. Something to make a girl feel secure and happy. I even reinstated that I wanted to be posted on social media as for various reasons but he really just doesnt wanna do it. I feel so broken and felt like an option only...


Correct me if I'm wrong but, most girls would want to be shown off on social media too isn't it? Am I giving too much to him since I've changed my interests and tried to understand his university schedules? I even go find him a lot of times when all he does is just to call at night to say goodnight. His reason is that he will just make it up to me on our travels but still insist a silent treatment on not posting our couple photo on any social media platform. No attention + hidden relationship = total anxiety eating me. 


If you were the guy, would you rather compensate just so you wouldnt loose your girl? How will you make it up to her on your very busy schedule? Any tips? I'm trying my best to save a dying relationship and all he say is we don't have a problem and I simply have to believe him. Is that enough to stick by?? Pls. Help. 


P. S. I would like to disclose that I often get compliments about how pretty I am and how people used to wonder why I'm single a year ago. So I don't see any point of him rejecting me or feeling cold towards me.

P. P. S. Considering my looks and university degree plus my attentiveness towards him, I don't know if he is just making me an option or is he already cheating on me?

I have been in a relationship for 2 years and my GF went to study abroad lately. She is overwhelmed with assignments and we hardly talk to each other, maybe once a week, sometimes less. We will still be in this distance relationship for a couple of months more. 

I was okay with that until I came across another girl lately, she was warm and caring and that just made me realize how not fulfilling my relationship has been. The chemistry, the emotion is not there like in our first days. I am not thinking of breaking up (yet) but I am not sure how long I can keep up with these issues unsorted out.

I intend to be honest with my GF about my feelings, the coldness of our relationship and see how we can fix it together but I am afraid I will hurt her. I tried to open this up indirectly a couple of times but she was not very interested to find out what I am really feeling.

I know my GF is very busy with her schoolwork and we both have a plan for our long-term commitment already. And the crush I am having won't last long anyway, I found out the other girl is relocating to another place soon (needless to say, I am sick of starting another distance relationship). Yet, having a feeling for another girl teaches me how my relationship does not fulfill my emotional needs.

Anyone in the same situation before? What did you do?

A mentor who thinks that there's no potential in my project and did not bother to guide or help me with the progress. A researcher in the lab who's out there to complain on nitty gritty things such as i should learn to handle instruments etc myself without even demo-ing to me; not even once and he complained to the prof about it. As such, approaching the end of this project, i'm at loss at what to do with failed experiment (that actually carried on due to the prof interest) and obviously with many people backstabbing behind my back, it's likely that i will not get a decent grade after sacrificing one whole summer and two semesters  to be a free labor for them. There was one such incident during summer when i did not go back during Friday as there was nothing scheduled on that day(i actually double confirmed with my mentor and he said no, nothing for that day)  and if i were to conduct experiment, they have to run in few consecutive days and friday is definitely not a good day to start experiments. So i did not go on friday and guess what? he texted me and scolded that i should be more active towards this project and come in to read some papers even though i had nothing to do. My friends said that i was letting these guys to push me around for such a long time and i should be saying something much earlier. Now that it was approaching the end and im really fearing for my grades, is it too late to say something to the department about the lack of proper guidance received (basically, no one in the group is working on the field of project i was working on and i was thrown into a situation when im left alone myself)?

So I've been going my own way for some time and randomly a friend of my whom recently got into a relationship with a girl he met in school asked if I was in a relationship. I told him I wasn't and am not intending to.

He immediately jumped out of laughter and said, ""more like you couldn't get any."" I was left baffled by his statement and asked why so?

He said, ""I've known you for 3 years and the reason you are not in a relationship is because you couldn't get any."" I'm by no means ugly. In fact I have a 6 pack whislt he has a dad bod.

And he's been with her for less than a month. He would literally skip lunch or even have 2-5 minutes to eat his lunch just to send his girlfriend back home from school and go back to school again (different timetables). And this idiot would go great lengths to spend all the money with her on food and she ate a few bites before telling him she doesn't feel hungry.

That's not all, they act as if they are a married couple by having to lecture each other on the time they reached home. She got pissed with him for reaching home late because she wasn't able to video call him. Sick cunt.

This was just one instance of simps acting like white knights and putting me down. Another guy from my class laughed at me for spending time alone on outside because I was a lonely loser with no girlfriend. The guys girlfriend posted a pic of her and another guy on her social media claiming the other guys gay but we all know what's she's been doing behind his bad. And to top it off, the girl never posted any pictures of the them on her social media but posted pictures with different guys on it. Not sure what kind of exclusivity this is.

Just to conclude, why do men like these choose to put someone down just because he's not dating or doing his own things? What do they have to gain by putting men like me down?

I think I have come to the point of giving up hope on ""friend"". Whenever I trusted them, they will simply destroy my trust. 

Let's name two of my ""close friend"" C and K. I had known C since young and our parents are very good friends as well. I told C a secret and mentioned not to tell anyone because it is not the time to reveal the secret yet. C agreed to it. However, C decided to tell another person, eventually the news came to my ears. I was shock and devastated at that time to hear such news. The thought of all the trust I have on C simply shattered at that moment. 

While K, we had known each other close to 10 years. I would say I am closer to K as compared to C as we usually interact more since we had quite a lot of common interest. Recently K's birthday is around the corner and since it is K's 21st birthday, I decided to make it something special as a birthday gift. Hence, I did a handmade birthday gift which I had never made one before. With my excitement, I went to Art Friend shop and spent more than an hour to think of how am I going to make a gift out of it (ps I am not an artistic person). Yet, I received a long message from K about K's disappointment in the handmade gift. K feel that I did not put in much effort despite thoughts that count. But to me, it gives me the vibes that K spent more money to buy my birthday gift as compared to what I gave to K hence K is disappointed. On top of that, K even mentioned that I did not spend the time to consider what K would like to have or able to use. K said that regarding my birthday gift, K had spend time to consider what would be useful for me, which to be honest, it is not practical for me. However, I appreciate the thought of K buying it for me and did not said anything. 

Other than those 2 ""close friends"" I have mentioned, I have also experienced abandonment and betrayal from other ""friends"" as well. Is it common to have these kind of friends in the society now? Friends that see benefits in you but once you no longer value, they simply throw you away...

1174,"hi guys, i need advice to REALLY get this message across: birthdays are important to me and when he doesn’t celebrate mine, our relationship takes a serious beating.

i’ve told him those exact words over the past 3 years but it’s really clear he doesn’t get it. we’ve argued over it and i’m always the first to let up because he has a knack of wiggling his way through any convo. 

some background:
over the past 2 years, my birthday has been less-than-ok because of him. the first year a failed gathering which i didn’t even know it was for my birthday until only after when he told me (no one wished me, no cake etc.); the second year, i observed him do nothing at small gathering w fam, he didn’t take charge or help out or contribute in anyway, just existed there where convenient. it rly made him look like a bum.

and this year i thought maybe things would change? not really. i had already lowered my expectations alot. tbh it was really as simple as cutting a slice of my favourite cake with him, or eating something new tgt. but i received a grabfood uncle with two slices of melted cake, which melted even more throughout the day. we both had classes that day so we didn’t plan to meet (apart from a 1 hour class in the morning and aft, i was actually free and i guess low-key waiting for him to show up), although turns out he didn’t even go for his, he just kind of lazed around at home.

he’s part of those ‘birthday-is-just-another-day-and-somemore-i-already-do-thing-for-you-on-other-day’ kind of people, which i really can understand. but if you know i ride alot of hopes on this day and literally any sign that u put in some effort into appreciating me will have 10x multiplier effect today, why is it so hard to just bring me out for nice dinner? or agree to do a small thing that i like to do that u don’t really like tgt?

i believe love is a verb and even though i know he loves me, i don’t feel appreciated or loved.

it’s such a stupid thing to get worked up over and i’ve been trying to supress this disappointment i feel. i guess NUSWhispers is where it resurfaces. so thanks all for listening.

Second month of dating, issue was on money, he feels like he is always paying for expensive meals (which happens maybe once a month), while i always pay for cheaper meals like drinks, desserts and hawker center food or cafe and lower end restaurants.  To be fair if he pays for dinner i will pay for dessert vice versa. And this month we argued about we not being able to stay over at each others house, how i cant be spontaneous and meet for supper on weekdays or be physically there when he needs me. To give a little background, we are both working adults i am getting a fixed salary while he is doing freelance, i do try to be supportive we will always talk over the phone on each other's bad days till late at night, and will meet 3-4 times a week. I do try to plan activities for us, like date nights or even asking him to come have dinner at my place or me going over to his place to have dinner after work. Is this me not putting in effort?

1182,"I’m going to be 21 this coming Nov and my fiance turned 30 a few months ago. We’ve been in a relationship for 2 years and he proposed to me 2 weeks ago. I was overwhelmed with feelings at that point of time and to think of it right now, I’m frightened. Not sure why is it so, because saw myself having a future with him as far as 1 year ago (he’s a sweetheart ever since he started pursuing till now, and also a person I can always rely on) and we’ve also gained the support from our parents despite the age gap. But I’m quite overwhelmed with the things I have to handle, like it’s my final year in uni, we have recently started on planning the wedding, etc and I have so much on my shoulders I don’t know who to talk to. Tried talking to my friends about this, but all they can tell me is to relax, don’t think so much etc which I can understand since they haven’t experienced this before. Can’t open up about this problem to him as he seems extra enthusiastic about this whole wedding ever since the proposal, so I definitely do not want to spoil his mood because of this. His friends even described how serious he was about this proposal. And I am truly touched. Finance is not an issue though, since he has been working for a few years with a decent income and both of us come from quite a well to do family. But I just don’t know, everything just seems so soon and it’s kinda suffocating me. Hais and I’d probably be a mom a few years later, since his mom has been constantly bringing this topic up whenever I’m over at his place. The thought of it is just rather terrifying to me.

I have nothing against that, but my family is well off and my parents definitely don't need any extra money. My (future) salary would be peanuts to them. I don't understand why I should give them a portion of my salary as a sign of filial piety because that would just be giving them something they don't need. Isn't spending time with them more meaningful? 

I understand that to them, giving money is filial piety (they send money to my grandparents overseas and we rarely visit) since they grew up poor. I am grateful for everything my parents did for me and their road to success must have been so difficult but I just wish that maybe they stop seeing money as a standard of filial piety... I definitely have no problems giving them a portion of my salary but I don't understand the rationale behind it if my parents are already well to do.

I would like to advise that you spend more time with him over at his place or anywhere convenient for him when he's not in Camp. Even better still, go out of your way to fetch him when he books out etc. He will definitely be very tired so this is a period where you really have to frequently go out of your way to accompany him. He's in SCS, so there's a decent chance that he should be mature enough to appreciate. It will definitely be a very trying time for both of you, but know that most relationships that make it through NS smoothly will likely last much longer.

1. Do it because you want to, not because of any other external factors.
2. Do it in your own time.
3. Be very very selective who you come out to initially. A bad experience can shake your confidence.

1190,"It is concerning how our society treats porn as a normality. I have been an avid user of porn or in stricter terms, a porn addict, during my younger years and was disillusioned about how sex should be. I started objectifying women and developing weird fetishes such as feet fetish. Like a chain smoker who feels crazy withdrawal symptoms every few hours without a cigarette, I feel an uncontrollable itch to start searching for stimulation on the Internet every time I was alone. The ability to get different stimulations easily with a new tab each time only made my addiction worse. After the usual gets boring, there would always be new fetishes to help me finish. After about ten years, I find myself numb from sex and unable to even get an erection with real women because my mind has become so accustomed to the unreal stimulations of porn that sex felt like a huge disappointment. I was diagnosed with erectile dysfunction about a year ago and have been on a nofap routine till now. My current partner has been very supportive and am really glad the abstinence paid off when my willy finally responded while we were making out last weekend. What I want to say is that for men who are currently having problems getting stimulated from your partner, the problem may not be your partner but rather your unrealistic expectations of sex formed from years of porn addiction? I also hope that parents of the newer generation would take the time to educate their young about sex properly instead of treating it as taboo and have their young learn about them through social media or porn which over sexualizes everything.

We have similar likes and dislikes, and we’re on the same page in terms of values, beliefs, goals and ideal timeline of life. Every thing he does somehow makes me smile. Every time i see him, i cant wait to sink into his arms. He makes me laugh just by being himself, and we share so many private jokes and lingo that no one else would understand. 

Of course on rare occasions we had some disagreements before, but we would always make up and don’t hold a grudge against each other. Whenever we encounter any tricky topics, we would always discuss things calmly and try to understand from both sides.

1199,"I was asked point blank if I was gay by a long-time straight friend after some drinks in front of a large group. Being still in the closet, and especially with such a large group I laughed it off and denied it. I don't blame him, alcohol makes it easier for people to ask personal questions. Nevertheless, I felt really uncomfortable that I couldn't give an honest answer, and I wish my friend was more sensitive with the whole affair. 

I don't think I've been flamboyant in any way, just that I've never dated a girl despite being shipped regularly, and I've always claimed being an unattractive nerd was the reason why.

I know there are those who say my true friends will stick by me after I come out, and that those in university are open minded, but I'm really scared. I'm scared of how many will actually remain, and amongst them how many will be understanding and continue to treat me same as per before. I'm sorry, but I'm not ready.

I'm scared that any new acquaintances in uni will judge me based on my sexuality over my personality. I've spoken to friends who would whisper to me in a lecture hall about how a random guy sitting a few rows in front is gay, even when I know nothing about him.

I'm scared my army buddies will run from me and see me as that guy who would add questionable stuff to their Milo.

Coming from a boys school, I'm scared that my bros of nearly a decade will see me as someone who might want to hit on them and distance themselves from me and cut off contact. I'm scared I'll no longer fit in. 

Sometimes, I know curiosity gets the better of all of us. I too, want to find out if my eye candy leans the same way. But there are different reasons between when you ask about someone's sexuality in front of a large group, versus when you ask in private. The first approach makes me feel like you just want to expose me to everyone else. But  if you want me to know that you're comfortable with who I am, there are plenty of ways to do it in private, which I think is a good way to build trust too. I won't give an honest answer either way at this stage, but it'll definitely make it alot less uncomfortable. I've always wished I could fit in and be straight like most people, but the reality is this is something I don't really have a choice over. I just hope my friends in the majority can be more understanding, and not to make it more difficult or uncomfortable for those with a different sexuality.

Furthermore, many of the jobs do not require expertise or knowledge pertaining to your degree. A recent news showed that half of Singapore grads find jobs not related to their degree. Goes to show how useless the core modules become when you graduate. Note to self: Memorize your notes, cause you can just forget it after finals.

Some may argue that you will learn soft skills, project management skills, get networks etc during your undergrad course. But you can also learn these while accumulating work experience, not to mention the salary which you can use to pamper and upgrade yourself.

Going to a JC used to be a popular choice for many of those who can. But as the gap between a diploma and bachelor cert closes (in terms of value for money from the perspective of a employer), will diploma be the new favourite? Or will fresh grads widen the gap by pursuing masters?

Every now and then, I see short guys expressing their frustrations and worries here. Height has never been a deal breaker for me. It is just a more visible trait  which may not be very important in sustaining a relationship. There are more practical considerations that women ought to start thinking about and I wish to illustrate these with my dates. I’ve dated a couple of guys who are taller than me and three guys who are shorter than me. 

Some of the taller guys had lower qualifications and also earned less. They told me they preferred someone who earned lesser and is more dependent on them. I was way too independent. These relationships did not work out because they needed to conform to the societal expectations of the man being the main or bigger provider. 

Another of the taller guys was a dessert chef in training and would often bring me desserts for supper after work. Still, this did not work out because we did not belong to the same race and our families were against the idea of us being together. 

The second last taller guy was a financial analyst. He is well-travelled, well-read and also well-fucked. We did not progress beyond our second date as he was insistent that sexual compatibility was the most important thing to him. He offered to be my “mentor” and suggested that we should not waste time if we are not sexually compatible. This did not work out because we had different priorities. We ran into each other some months later. He said he was engaged but still looking as he was not sure there wasn’t someone more suitable. I was glad I dodged a bullet. 

The last tall guy was confident, successful and smart. He also had a habit of canceling our date at the last minute. I felt like I was the backup plan and did not wish to be waiting for someone who did not prioritize me. 

Now on to my shorter dates. 

One of the shorter guys was a staunch Buddhist. He tried too hard to convert me into a vegetarian and insisted that I try meditation. When I rejected him, he sent me many messages about how he could not stop crying. Pretty sure I dodged another bullet there. 

The other shorter guy decided to turn up unshaven, with dirt in his eyes for our date in town, in a really old T-shirt, shorts and slippers. He then had the cheek to advise me that women like myself who are taller than average (I’m actually only in 160s) ought to dress in a way that make ourselves appear more petite. I wondered if I was in a set-up in some reality tv show about nightmare dates. 

Then I met my husband. I am about 10 cm taller than my husband but it did not bother me one bit. We are compatible in more ways that I can imagine. And one thing I’ve noticed is that he tries harder than any other guys I’ve dated and never lets his height limit him. He does more than his share of housework, he cooks and bakes better than me. He is committed and puts in effort in dates. 

I can’t speak for all the women but I would rather be in a relationship with someone who understands what it takes to sustain a marriage than with who is taller but doesn’t pull his weight.

I am sure there are men who are tall and good looking and put in effort too. These are few and far between and probably all snapped up by equally rare women the minute they are available on the market.

Start looking beyond the appearances for hidden gems!

1229,"I am a Year Two local university student and I have been attached to my gf for around 3 months. However, I always wonder whether I should be concerned about the way we got together. 

Earlier this year, before we got attached, one of my good friends from my JC (who is also in my course) told me he liked her. At that time, I already knew I liked her and that she also had some feelings for me. But at that moment I hid all these from him because I wasn’t comfortable sharing. 

However, after seeing my friend go out with her a few times, I decided that I had to act, and went to confess to her directly, and that’s how we got attached. 

Now, me and my gf stopped talking to my friend altogether, and my gf kept assuring me that it was the right thing to do, because she eliminated him fair and square, and I have already fell out with him since. 

Right now, I’m quite content with the state of my relationship. But I want to ask how to prevent my former friend from spreading about what happened and ruining my rep in school, and whether the way I got together with my gf was wrong. I feel that it isn’t because all is fair in love? At the end of the day, I won her heart and he didn’t what.

I guess you can say that I am a bad influence - you have became more calculative and wary of people compared to the past.

I was clearly not your best choice... and you already knew that I was someone full of issues. Despite everything, we stuck together for many years. Most of the time, you were the one protecting and loving me. You never gave up.

But I can see the change in your feelings now. Recently, I’ve became depressed. I talked about death. You have always hated my negativity so I guess.... this is a new level. I can tell that you are trying to avoid me. You rather be with your friends and family.

We have tried to talk abt this, but it never worked out. You’ve clearly reached your threshold. Maybe you do not even want to be associated with me anymore. That’s okay, I guess. With the failures in my life, I will never be good enough for anyone anyway. Even my family do not care about me. All they care is about flaunting achievements. When I share my feelings with them, they scold me for being negative.

I’ve always wondered why do people suicide. Life is short and for all you know, you may even die of cancer at 30 years old. So why don’t you enjoy life to your maximum?

1231,"Hello, I would like to share some thoughts. 

When I worked at a restaurant as a server in the past, I would come across so many customers who don't finish their meals. Some of them barely touched it. Sometimes my manager will ask them if the food is not to their liking, but they would just reply by saying they are already full. 

It's funny because they ordered so much food that the dishes are filling up the entire table. 

Please don't order/ask for so much food if you can't finish it. And if you have too much food on your plate, please share it with your friends/family/neighbours. Don't waste food. 

This is not because someone else across the globe is starving, but because many people worked very hard to provide the food for you (think - the farmers, chefs/hawkers, your parents, your helper). As a consumer,  you don't always see how hard it can be to prepare the dishes but it can be a tiring process. People say throwing food away is a sinful waste and therefore an immoral act. I think that it's more immoral to disappoint those who have invested so much into making something for you. 

Sometimes when we bring the unfinished meals back to the kitchen to throw it away, we try not to let the cooks see them because they get sad. 

I hope this resonates with some of you. Thank you for reading.

Until I came to uni and realized I don't genuinely like anyone I meet ???? it's like I can make conversation when required of me, but it's bothersome to me. I don't have many friends that I can turn to (just a few cliques here and there), since I don't find joy in small talk and superficial hi-bye friendships, and hence hardly reach the stage of building deep relationships with them. Also, when I meet new people, I see things that I dislike in them super quickly, which makes me not even want to try to befriend them. lt doesn't even have to be a whole personal encounter for me to come to such a conclusion, a short few seconds would do. One reason could be that I think I tend to see through people's intentions very easily and hence don't fall prey to all the fakeness going around? Or maybe it's that I just don't have much love to spread around lol all exhausted on my family and bf? 

Since wide connections seem to be very important to succeed in life these days, I do often reflect on myself and wonder why I'm like this? Am I really that bad of a person?

Your not the only one with that problem. I once had a partner who would deliberately (and always) pretend to not know things or get names and details wrong just to seek attention. Eventually, I grew tired of the unhealthy behaviour, as well as the perpetually need to correct the person’s mistakes, and went ahead to initiate the break up.

It felt wonderful, super liberating in fact! :)

Anyway, my point is that you need to be able to see yourself spending the rest of your life with the other party instead of allowing others to mislead or misguide you. For your case, please trust your judgement — only you can tell whether she’s the right partner for you.

I wanted to marry him after 2 years of dating and hinted to him but he didn’t take any action. I was quite disappointed with him, especially about our financial plan and savings. 

As the years go by, I realised the things we want in life are no longer the same. I love challenges and travel around by myself (because he doesn’t want to join me or not interested) , and he is an idle person, stay at home and like a coach potato, not keen in exploring new stuff. I know something isn’t right in the 3 year of relationship and asked my friends whether is it normal that sometimes I didn’t miss him and forgot to text him when I was traveling. My friends told me it’s normal when you are busy and don’t think too much. I tried to find back the love we had but unable reconnect to him. I just hold on to it....I didn’t realise “it is the time to let go” until I met someone else who is younger and fun who I can connect to. We chat and talked a lot stuff (he flirts with me but I didn’t take it seriously). In a way, the existence of this new guy makes things clearer that I have grown apart from my bf. So I broke up with my boyfriend and I told him I need some time to rethink of this relationship. Breaking apart would make things clearer. After breaking up with him, surprisingly I feel relieved and guilty at the same time. Guilty because I hurt him and wasted his time. He tried to chase me back but i rejected. Things didn’t turn out nicely as he was quite a jerk, took back some expensive stuff he bought for me... Anyway those fancy stuff doesn’t matter to me, so that’s alright.

My friends know him as the “Mr Nice” and my friends think I betrayed him for someone else. Because the existence of this person and I broke up with him? I still feel bad for him and friends think I am a bitch, heartless. There is nothing much I can do, as I can‘t explain and don’t think they would understand. 

I still chat with this fun guy I met. He knows I broke up and decided to chase me. My friends (not-so-close) advised me to find someone who is financially stable - build a family and stop wasting my youth and time on this guy. He is 5 years younger than me but somehow we can connect and I’m genuinely happy when I’m with him. He asked me out for dating and I’m still hesitating. One side of me want to hang out with him, know him better but another side worried that i might hurt him. He might think that he has chance. I worried that if I let this continue and we might not be compatible in the end (maybe because of age gap and financial status) then I will hurt another guy.

As much as I tried to make her happy everyday I could tell that every time when she is out with me she is thinking about how to handle her parents when she gets home.

I know everyone will tell me to breakup with my current bf because i dont deserve him etc etc, yes i brought up to my current bf that i wanted to breakup because i had been seeing another guy which treats me way better than him. I told that to his face - i like someone else and wanted to dump him. He  suddenly became possessive and obsessed over me, it went by in stages, initilly he begged and tried using pity to get me back, when that didnt work, he resorted to threatening me to reveal that guy and used words like 'i wont give you peace or 'u cant escape from me because youre mine'. He almost resorted to violence and said he would kill himself and me so no one could have me if he cant

BY doing this he is further confirming that i did the right thing to dump him, but im also afraid he would harm the ppl i love. At this stage dont give a shit if he suicides as long as he leave us alone.

1274,"I'm a girl in a relationship with a guy (we are long term friends)

Thing is, I am attracted to girls; I got together with my guy friend because of how well we clicked. Like I do feel that a relationship is also about whether we can do life together and our understand of each other is really great...rather than just sexual attraction.

Recently, I met a girl who I fancy, and I know that she fancies me too. I told my current partner about this, and he told me to ""be who I am"" and chase her (and we would remain close friends). 

I feel uneasy about this. I would have normally done so if I were single, but I can't help shake of the notion of 'cheating'. Plus, life in this relationship has been great; we can understand each other really well. On that basis, I'm not sure if I ""should be who I am"", because that's not fair to him.

When I saw Susan, she looked a bit different in terms of facial features and dressing. I commented that she looked prettier today, but she replied awkwardly ""ah, I always dress like that what"".

Turns out, the girl I met was Susan's twin sister, Sally. I was in rude shock, but decided to stay on for dinner as the food had already come. Sally came in place of her sister because Susan is sick. Sally and I really had a good time though, despite the surprise in the middle of the meal. We kind of hit off well. I am starting to like her a lot, her personality and looks. Both twins are single rn. But now, I'm so confused when I think about Susan. I honestly dk how to feel. Should I be angry that Susan did not pre-empt me beforehand? Or empathise with a GWS?

1. While I was doing my industrial attachment in year 3, I happened to meet a senior who had just graduated and was working at the company for about a year. He’s the kind of guy who has his good looks hidden behind his glasses. He has a calm demeanour and is really nice and friendly. He’s quite buff and strong, and i heard from colleagues that he still goes to nus gym to work out. I didn’t approach him and just treated him as a crush. I regret this so much. I should have approached him but i don’t know how and what to do. We were in different departments so i would occasionally pop by the floor his department is on to look at him. I decided to try to work out at nus gym maybe to see him and strike up a conversation. I went almost daily to try to find him but he only goes on saturdays. Every saturday i will try to find him at the gym but recently his disappeared. and i’m no longer on my IA at the company. here’s my first question: How can i find him again?
2. i usually am quite active on snapchat. the people who add me are close friends and they know about my crush on the senior. One day i went to a department store and saw a girl being quite close to my crush. I don’t know if she’s her girlfriend but my heart was crushed. i knew i stood no chance because he looked very happy and she was quite pretty and tall. i took a photo of them from far to post on snapchat to say that i have officially dropped out of the race to get him. After a few hours i realised the posts on my snapchat were screenshotted several times. i panicked because it was something quite private. and i felt so stupid for putting that online. I found that it was girl A who had screenshot and decided to go on her instagram to see if she posted the screenshot on instastory. long story short, i found out through some stalking that girl A was actually a close friend of my crush’s girlfriend. How should i confront girl A? she betrayed my trust. as if losing my crush is not enough. I really feel so down on my luck.

A few years ago, I started befriending a guy, James. James reciprocated my interest to be friends, and he even showed more interest than me. Like me, James was lonely without close friends. The friendship was very enjoyable. However, at some point, I started finding myself being irritated by James. 

Am I socially awkward? Is this the reason why I was dumped by my close friends, because I did things to prevent myself from being irritated and I irritated them instead? Is James socially awkward too? Is this the reason why James is also lonely without close friends?

James and I remained as friends, though not as close friends. I was still irritated by him and I started irritating him too. The friendship felt really toxic. At the same time, James had another friend, and the situation was similar to ours. James and her used to be close, but at some point the friendship became toxic.
Recently, James’ friend decided to end her friendship with James. I was inspired to end my friendship with James too. Coincidentally, James has just found another gal friend and is enjoying his new friendship. He is optimistic that he has finally found his true friend, while I am skeptical about it.

Now I feel tired and lost. Should I continue searching for friends or should I stop trying? I am waiting to see if James' new friendship will last. If it lasts, maybe James is right, I will just have to find the true friend for me.

1298,"To OP #70401:

I was in the same boat as you a few years ago and ended up initiating a breakup with my then bf. Perhaps our circumstances might not be exactly the same, but let me just share some thoughts based on my experience.

Texting other girls might seem harmless, perhaps they are really just friends, but do look at the bigger picture as well. Has he been giving you the same amount of time and attention as those girls? For instance, my ex used to claim that he’s perpetually busy at work, and that he’s no big texter. He hardly texted me, so I felt really cheated when I found out that he has been engaging in a lot of casual  text conversations with other girls.

Perhaps he is not telling the truth about them just being friends, who knows maybe they knew each other from dating apps, which are so easily accessible nowadays? Especially since you mentioned he has new girls to talk to every now and then. Very suspicious, how is it possible that he can make so many new friends (and all girls) within a short period of time? Since he said they are “friends”, maybe you can try asking him how he got to know those “friends”, then observe his reactions. You can even jokingly ask him to introduce you to them one day. If he sounds hesitant, turns defensive or blame you for having trust issues, most likely something is going on. At this point, if your insecurity bothers you so much, and if he’s not cutting down on those texting habits despite knowing that you feel uncomfortable, I suggest you just leave already. If you choose to stay, just pray hard that you will somehow find out the truth (if any) before it’s too late. In my case, one fine day my friend saw my ex bf’s profile on a dating app, alerted me, purposely initiated conversations with him and asked him out to test his reactions, and the rest was history....

I think the biggest red flag is that he hit on other girls while giving the impression that he is single. Once you know of this, it actually no longer matters that he claims that he is serious with you, having introduced you to his parents etc., because hey, his behaviour totally shows otherwise! Please don’t just accept his words of reassurance blindly. In my case, we’re already discussing marriage and I was just waiting for him to propose. When I caught him cheating and confronted him, he told me it was because actually he still wanted to explore and not ready to settle down! Well, why would your bf market himself out there as single if he’s ready to commit to you and only you? Seems like he wants the comfort of having someone to always fall back on, while at the same time still wanting to fool around and perhaps looking for better options out there. Please don’t waste your time and youth on him, there are still a lot of guys out there who are more deserving of your love and care and will treat you as priority and not a spare. You might be tempted to stay in this relationship due to the fear of being alone etc, but once you let go, it actually feels very liberating. Been there done that, and eventually met someone who is better in every way, able to address my insecurities and never leaves me wondering whether he truly loves me. 

Apologies for the long post, I wish you all the best in making up your mind and hope you will eventually find your happiness.

1300,"Hi, 

*lengthy post ahead

I am currently a year 1 student in comp science (part-time) from a local uni. Just a rough background of myself, i came from an engineering diploma from poly, and am in my mid 20s.

Recently I have the thought of dropping out from the course and apply for an IT course in SUSS instead. Reason being: 1) it does not have maths/engineering related modules as compared to the local uni, modules were IT related. 2) local uni's workload is much more and fast-paced, bellcurve with full time students and I would say I'm generally not a fast learner. 

However the business IT course focuses on mainly a specific area of IT (The degree course is quite a niche area I guess) hence Is it advisable to go for it or would a comp science degree is better as it offers a wider range of job opportunities? Currently I do not know which area of IT I would like to dive into hence I chose Comp science degree so that it allows me to explore the various options while studying in uni. 

However recently as considering my age factor etc once I graduated from uni, would it be wiser if I take up the SUSS course instead as it allows me to build my experiences in it and also to allow myself to kinda just force to try ""grow"" interest in it?
As the modules in Comp science are quite general and by the time I graduated, I might not have the ""in-depth"" skills to allow me to build my experiences in the area I would like to dive in.

What should I do?

A: change course to the SUSS course immediately, which the sch will starts in Jan, or in July.
B: stick with current local uni course, in the meantime search job related to the suss course and work there to see if I enjoy that area of IT. (Bt this could means I will miss the Jan intake and would have to join the July intake).

Thanks all for reading!

Same! Convos between me and my crush are mostly academics stuff... I usually want to try to keep the convo going but as she is from a different clique as mine, I'm not exactly sure what she likes to talk about, so it's hard. Partly also because when she asks questions, I assume that she's studying so I don't really want to disturb her too much with my replies (especially that it's recess week now)

Might be similar for your case (although the roles are swapped). I think it's possible to tell from his replies if he finds it annoying. Maybe initiate a non-academic convo if you know what topic you both have in common. It might just be that he doesn't now what else you want to talk about and can't get the hint.

I am really concerned right now, as a Y2 CS student, as I have an average cap of around 4, and no achievements. I am afraid of not being able to find a decent internship after Y2, and I am afraid that because I have nothing to stand against other students, I will not be able to find a decent job after graduation.

1319,"Thinking of having children but just can’t trust your man that he won’t meander into another woman’s arms? Here is a practical advice that would pretty much gurantee he won’t deviate cos he risk losing too much. The more he is experienced, the more he will be afraid to lose you. 

If you like a man and you don’t want to lose him, hold on to him using your third hand. For life. 

Pre or post marriage whatever. The cert should hardly matter to you if you find the right man. The strength of your relationship will be determined by your ability to grab and hold him with your third hand.

Forget abt all the preaching of “holy” people who talk so much but in the end are hypocrites with secret affairs behind their “holy” significant other. Nah, I already have it distilled down to a science while people still think sustaining marriage is some kinda wishy washy hoping with faith. 

Guys are like kids that needs to be held by the third hand all the time so that they don’t lose their way. 

Also forget about all the crazy techniques in bed you saw as video and all the nonsense you ever saw or read and thought, ‘that would please a man in bed’. Those are like hollywood action shows, it would be a painstaking effort with little return. 

The only technique in bed that u shd be concerned abt is tightness. You are on the right track when it becomes clear that he would sell his soul to live another day with you on earth. Doesn’t matter how experienced he is before he met you.

Jade pigeon eggs. 

Your ancestors can thank me later. I need all the positive karma I can get to meet my wife the next life too. 

-from a guy happily married to a wife for ten years with a kid and have literally zero interest in any other woman. All that confidence. All freaking plastic bags. 

P.s.- YMMV, since attitude in life and character must match first or his life will be a perma BDSM of “hate her mind but love her body too much to leave”

1320,"“I was like an ‘incel’ kid.  I’d never had a girlfriend.  I’d only had sex with prostitutes.  I was very suicidal.  Then one day I was standing next to a cute girl at a bus stop, and I googled: ‘How to approach women.’  

That’s when I came across a forum for pick-up artists.  It’s exactly what I’d been looking for.  It seemed like a cure for my autism.  I watched all the videos I could find.  I started working out at a gym.  I’d spend all day approaching women.  Soon I was only hanging out with other pick-up artists.  They respected me.  They wanted to learn from me.  Finally there was something I was good at.  

Right now I have over one thousand numbers in my phone and had sex with 20+ woman.  It’s a bit like gambling.  Sometimes it goes well.  Sometimes it doesn’t.  But you always have the chance for sex.  There are so many tricks to learn.  

Women have emotional brains.  They get addicted to feelings.  You can use that to your advantage.  The first time you meet her—tell her she looks amazing.  But never give her a full compliment again.  She’ll always chase that validation.  It’s like a drug.  Tell her ‘she looks beautiful for her age.’  Tell her ‘she looks good in this lighting.’  Keep her insecure with half compliments.  Keep her feeling like there’s something wrong with her.  Like she’s not good enough for you.  Like she needs sex for validation.  

Of course it’s manipulation, but why should I care?  I’ve been manipulated so many times in my life (bankers, sales, MLM, corporate boss etc).

I am a hard introvert. My current s/o keeps pressuring me about how I do not care about them. When I gave my all to them, they keep neglecting my needs or cut short my recovery/recharge by going out. I don't like going out. But when it comes to them, I have to bend and break myself to give them what they want. I do not know what to do for them anymore. I feel so exhausted and every time I get a message from her is never something good or it is something bad about me needing time alone. I am working adult and they are studying. But everytime I ask for time to rest, they sulk. My off days are always dedicated to her, my friends or my family. I do not have time for myself.

It is so bad that I begun hating myself for it. I hate my introversion and it is eating me up because it is me. I am a hard introvert. If it was not for my monetary issues, I would have stayed home and draw the whole day.

1322,"Hello!

Will require some genuine career advice. I always had interest in a certain field and had been working in this field after I graduated in May. The job scope (sales related) is not something that I like, and I wasn't able learn much valuable knowledge about the field from the job. It is, however, a full time job and I truly liked everyone in my job. 

I recently got an offer for a niche role in the particular field. It's a role that I think I will learn and grow a lot more in the role. It is a 2 year contract role, and I am not too sure if there will be much job security in this job.

On one hand, I am feeling guilty now for leaving a job with nice people, especially so when they are facing a period of uncertainty and things are getting busy. On the other hand, I feel that the other job will give me a chance to learn more about the field.

Would like to seek genuine advice on whether I should switch jobs. No trolls please :)

1323,"Guys,
Recently I was invited for a Interview in one of the Big Telco giants in somerset for a Sw engineering Job. I was representing a recruiting firm

The HR was supposed to be the point of contact and I called her after reaching,  I was early by 30 mins and she clearly said can't  come now in a rude manner. I was waiting in the lobby.

She came and registered in the lobby it seems and gave me a visitors ID card in hand. From this point to till I left the building she never spoke a word. 

Interview was delayed by at least 20 mins and even then she didn't utter a word. Then comes the ordeal , Job description and my resume never matched and the interviewer did not seem to be interested to conduct the process and so was I and He just came out of the room and he was having discussion with his colleague and did not even say a bye. 

Disappointed and came home  and next day is where it turns out to be fun. I forgot to give the visitors card purely unintentional and now the HR wants me to go to their office and Give. 

I did not think twice to say NO even the recruitment agency. But they  had constant check on the returning the card. I threw it away the next day. 

All this happened 20 days ago and yesterday the agency guys whatsaped me , you pay 50 SGD fine or its a police case. Reason was any one can enter their office now .I was amused and said clearly I wont pay and I threw away the card and agency seemed to threaten and I said clearly I wont pay if need be let me answer to the police. At last Agency guy said he accepted to pay the fine.  

May be I will said as a cheap guy in the comments but I did not do anything wrong from my perspective and neither did the agency. Just because the HR is from the mighty Telco , The person is so demanding.

1)HR did not speak a word or give Any instructions on where to return the card when she gave me. 
2)HR did not escort me out post interview.

I don't mind paying 50 SGD and making peace but I feel If I pay then the mistake is on me - Your genuine thoughts please.

During my exchange, i am able to do a research project on it despite not having any formal education in it as i learn everything by myself. I am now seriously considering whether should i pursue a phd on it instead of my engineering degree but this will mean that i will end up jobless in Singapore should i come back. This means that i have to give up living in Singapore as the only jobs i can get will be overseas and i will have to compete with insanely smart people around the world which i may not be able to. So should i trade my engineering skills that come along with easy and comfortable life with something that i am passionate about but at the cost of highly competitive, difficultly, low guarantee of success and less than 6 hours sleep?

Back then, I used to hang out with this pretty attractive girl. Different girl from my previous post. Slender body, nice smile, and fair skin. We’ll head out to movies and dinners. Frequently in movies, she will ask me if I’m naughty or not. She likes to place my hands on her thigh, inching closer by the minutes, when it’s not even a horror movie. Thereafter we went to take a stroll, she pointed to me an inexpensive hotel, asked if I would like to spend a couple of hours there. She wants to do ‘it’ with me. I looked at her in amazement, in disbelief that this very day arrived, not on a stormy night wherein the movies, people seek shelter but a freaking random weekend. I joked that there isn’t a 7-eleven nearby, so it’s not going to happen. But in fact, I already spotted one while we were strolling. I can sense her disappointment, her urge, that she can conquer the night, she was more prepared and mentally ready than me getting pumped up for a 24km march. You tried being pro-active, hinting me with your scantily clad attire, of how beautiful your legs and body were. It’s not that you’re not pretty, or not attracted to what you have to offer but it’s just that my ‘Guild’ needs me. Still, I’m sorry…glad that you found someone you love now

I can’t even look at her, and end up doing all kinds of stupid things and saying disrespectful stuff to her.

I deleted my Instagram when I broke up for awhile and didn’t bother to contact any online friends then. When I reactivated my social media, she would leave lots of comments on my igstory even if I didn’t responded. I decided to befriend said girl since I realised we had some common interests.

She let it slipped once by accidentally mentioning a name. She seems to know about me more than she is disclosing. After hanging out for slightly more than a month she confessed that she chanced upon my pics 3 years ago on the explore page on Instagram and has been attracted since then. She also admitted to having followed my private twitter, Reddit, basically every social media I have under other usernames/throwaway accounts. She has also confessed that she wants more than a friendship with me and proceeded to pin me and forced a kiss onto me. Since then she has been slowing letting me know that she has actually been wildly stalking me and she admitted to stalking all my friends as well to know more about me. I’ve rejected her advances since the day she confessed. When I started seeing one of my friends and she found out she wasn’t happy about it. She tried to talk me out of it and told me that I’ll never find someone better than her. We had a talk and I decided to cut her off.

Been browsing on Instagram, sometimes I see Instagram Story advertisements. Things like careers in financial advisory, setting up an e-commerce shop, and other stuff, but those are not what I want to ask about. 

What I want to ask about are overseas internships. I have seen story advertisements from Absolute Internship and Capital Placement which talk about overseas internships in places like the UK, Spain, and other places not Singapore(though SG is a location). Looks good on paper: Work overseas and experience life as a pseudo-local there for three to six months. Might be a good resume bulding activity. Sure, it will not be fun and games like SEP, but it might be a stepping stone to either a full-time opportunity at the SG branch if no desire to work overseas and if they have one, or a possible ticket to a long term working pass overseas.

I'm just afraid that he will be surprised that i have been used by many guys before him. And i will have to find a new bf all over again on the app.

Recently I met a guy on CMB, I'm okay with everything with him but his honesty feels like a double edge sword. I like it now but feels like I will hate it later on.

Like you cut your hair and ask your man notice anything different right. One time he answer me, ""cut hair ah, previous one nicer."".  but he always follow up with, ""but you happy can already.""

Ask him his Instagram follow what, he tell me, ""chio bu lor."" then I ask ""more chio then me not?"" his reply ""of course more chio then you la, but nvm la I also not shuai we both 6/10 together perfect match.""

I feels like he Liddat always say whatever he wants then he knows I won't be happy so he add one more line to bring it back. But I feel he do now cos we fresh and he put in effort.

1363,"I am a 24 y/o male looking for some relationship advice. When i was a freshman, i joined this club that likes all things jap and i got close to this guy J. We hit off quite well in no time, since we share similar hobbies and similar tastes in japanese things. We also spent a lot of time having deep conversations and met up regularly to eat. Surprisingly, he agreed with me on a lot of topics I thought was controversial and not many would agree with. In no time, we became best friends and whenever there is a jio we will only go if  both of us are going. 

The next thing I knew, he got attached, I wanted to be happy for him and I congratulated him but i was quite upset and  angry that i wasnt the first to know about it. He didnt even tell me anything about girls or that he had someone he liked. Because of this I gave him the cold shoulder. Not like he actually cared, since he has a gf now. But barely a few days in, I kinda missed his presence and how we used to share with each other our deepest secrets. Seeing him and his gf flirting around so much also made me really uncomfortable. 

Anyway, I made some other friends and this girl N showed me some BL manga. At first i was quite shocked at the contents, is this how hardcore bl is supposed to be? But i found myself enjoying the manga and even asked for more recommendations. And when i met J again, i couldnt help but visualise him and me together. I think im gay for him. But he is a hetero and i dont think its going to work out since he has a gf. So i gave up on him. 

But now, he broke up with his gf a month ago and came back to me for company and we started talking alot again. I told myself that I need to stop this toxic r/s cos my feelings are growing even more as i spend time with him. But I cant help it whenever our hands touch or he pats my head when I got a A for my essay. 

This is our final year and I dont know what should i do... should i confess or should i just leave this friendship and stop torturing myself with this feelings? advice needed please.

There's prof that went thru at most 50 slides per mod and I have to multiply that with 5 mods. Imagine that!!!! I'd say I'm a relativity slow learner, I can only learn fast provided if the concept make sense to me. However rn atm, I'm forced into H2 bio (I only got till sec 2), h2 maths (I don't even have amaths) etcetc and I'm constantly burning the midnight oil everyday and still a lot of the concept taught still don't make sense to me. Idk I'm probably dumb or sth. I'm really questioning myself if I should withdraw cause fyi, I got into the major I'm in rn because it is almost similar to my poly course, so I assumed it would be easy for me to enter uni (but i never liked the course). Side note when I was in my last year of poly, uni was never my option, I just told myself that if I'm able to make it, I'll go, if not I'll just work. However idk what's up with me, Im probably insecure of my future and didnt wanna lose out cause lets be real here, degree holders are everywhere, not having one makes me lose an edge nsixiakxjwks. 

That leads me to think, whether or not should i withdraw, I feel thay uni is really not the place for me, everything here is so overwhelmed, I'm not enjoying school like how I used to. I'm not happy. Constantly stressed out. Not having enough time although I've sacrificed my social life, and burning the midnight oil. I feel that I'm better off working. But people kept telling me that for a poly student to get into uni, it's not easy. I shouldn't make such a impulsive decision and regret later. Maybe I should try out one sem and decide after that. What do you guys think? Degree over happiness or the other way round? For me it's happiness but still degree is so so so important in Singapore. Sighhhhhh. What should i do now and is it true that it is hard to fail in uni?

I've just graduated last year and found a job related to my degree, receiving a salary of 4.1k, which is the average salary of people with my degree.

So, my fiancee and I have BTOed, currently waiting for our flat and our wedding ceremony will be held a year later, after she graduates from uni. Since I came from a much humbled background as compared to her, my family and I would usually take the public transport, or at most grab/rent a car on rare ocassions. Since I'm currently working with a decent salary, I've decided to purchase a car so that it would be much convenient for everyone and I can bring her out on dates more often too. However, when I told her about this plan, she doesn't seem to understand things from my POV. She mentioned that we will be spending lots of money on our new flat, wedding dinner, honeymoon, my tuition loans etc and the car would be a financial burden. Basically she hates the idea of me owning a car, despite giving in to her by choosing a cheaper car. She mentioned that owning a car in SG is equivalent to burning money away since it's COE only lasts for 10 years, hence the depreciation.

Okay, so everytime we get into this topic, she just doesn't seem to give in and we have been in this conflict for about 2 weeks. And I'm honestly so fed up. She knows that I love cars since young and owning one is my lifetime dream. I'm super lost right now, how should i convince her to let me own one?

She became cold towards me lately, even coaxing her with food doesn't help like how it does in the past. Although she doesn't ignore me, I can tell that she is very unhappy by her attitude through the phone or irl. I did not expect her to react in such a way since she grew up from a rather wealthy background and travelling by cars were her go to. But she mentioned that she didn't want her parents to support her after we get married. I really don't like to see her being unhappy, but I really want to own one car.

I’m in NUS year 1 right now. 

However I’ve been feeling down lately for quite a while. My Girlfriend broke up with me almost two years ago and we were together for 4 years. 

I’ve been going out on dates for a year post breakup but it’s not helping.  Most of the time there will not be a second date afterwards. It’s difficult to initiate a second meetup when the girl I’m out with doesn’t seem like she’s better than my ex.. 

It’s been almost a year since I last went on a date, I don’t think I’m bad looking.. I’ve not been able to bring myself to kissing another girl/sleeping w them. 

Deep down I still love her but she’s not ready for any relationship ( I’m not sure if she meant it ) at this moment, I’m diverting my attention on work and studies.

It’s really tough, it’s taking a toll on me. I’ve to agree that I’ve crushes here and there and it will probably help me move on if I’m able to date them but I do not have the courage to try - I fear rejections and I know for a fact that I shouldn’t rely on flings as distractions.

But whatever it is, I still love my ex and if I could I would still date her and accept her for who she is. 

Please advise me on what I should do. My savings are not that high hence I’m unwilling to  go out on dates with other girls unless she’s my ex, because she’s the only girl I’m willing to spend whatever cash I have to see the smile on her face

Thank you for hearing me out, apologies if the sentence structure isn’t up to standard. I just poured whatever was on my mind

Lastly I believe I’ve changed for the better. I’ve been more understanding, open minded and loving.

When something doesn't go their way, like not getting into Orbital (which is really only 4 MCs over the summer), these people start complaining like it's the end of the world, behave as if their CS major is forever ruined, and start demanding for things to start going their way.

These people need to realize that not everything is handed to you in university, and that they need to get used to not getting things that they want, and start finding solutions rather than waste time blaming things that can't/won't change, at least for the moment.

I get paranoid, because it is not a one-off incident. Over the years, I've tried my best to trust him. But whenever I have flashback of what he did to me, I would question his actions, check on him and his phone - not because I want to pick on him, but I just didn't want what I fear most to happen. To me what he did has cheated on me emotionally and I just needed that assurance that it won’t happen again, ever. He doesn’t quite get it - he thinks I'm doing all these to picked on him. He said he has changed for the better. There were instances that I believe he did. But recently, I caught him doing something of that similar nature, which I can’t accept. The intentions, to me, were clear, and still the same. He claimed that there’s nothing bad or wrong.

Instead of feeling remorseful for hurting me, he just decided that I should accept him for who he is, what he is doing, otherwise I should just leave. I felt that he just wouldn't give in anymore. And I can’t blame him fully for that. Because whenever I found out that he did something, I get more paranoid, and question him, even more. Our quarrels become more frequent, intolerable. I can’t sleep because I would have anxiety when the thoughts of him doing all those things behind my back comes flooding my mind. I tried hard to accommodate. But because the pain and hurt is still so fresh, and because I still have anxiety and panic attacks about the past incidents - I would become very very unloving and undesirable. He says he couldn’t smile at me or be happy to see me anymore. But he could, to others. No doubt he is still treating me relatively well when we are not quarrelling. But the way he sees me has changed. The way he thinks about me has changed. He sees me as someone that is unreasonable, pushy, overly demanding for him to change and every now and then I attempt to find fault with him and quarrel. But that’s not my intention. And I never want to quarrel with him. 

I try to find even more ways to prove to myself that he loves me, to make up to the part where I felt that he doesn’t. So whenever he’s with me, he’s nice to me – I’m okay. Cause I stop thinking. But when I realized he treat others somewhat better, or when he is not around with me, I will start to think otherwise. Cause I’m hurt from what he had done, I reacted because I needed time to heal. For hurting me, can’t he be more understanding? Why can’t he understand the pain he brought to me and the harm to the r/s for doing so. He said he is tired too. Tired of trying when he knows he can’t agree with me. And when these are the answers I get from him - I get more agitated, more upset. 

At this point, he would break it. He would get really pissed, at why am I always trying to find fault in him, and he would get really mad at me. He thinks I’m finding trouble with him, esp when he is tired from work. He would then block me off and get angry for days. Leaving me sleepless, paranoid and even more hurt. Even when I tried to talk it out nicely to him about my concerns – he would think that all these talks are useless.  It’s either I accept it, or I leave. 

Past few weeks was like hell. I felt the need to confront him about the matter that he was doing. I plead him to change because if he don’t, we can't move on. And I can’t sleep. I plead him not to do it, not to hurt me, but he can’t fulfil that promise. He doesn’t agree because he don’t see any wrong in it. I needed so much assurance. At the same time, because I decided to put faith in us and that he would eventually understand my pov, so I would raise this matter to him again and again, but every time – I get the same outcome- unhappiness, unsatisfied, unsettled. And he thinks I’m just looking to quarrel with him, not giving him any breaks week after week.

No longer does he want to be in this r/s, nor to change for us. But to me, even at the breaking point, even when I think that breaking up would be the better option since he couldn’t understand - I still decided that I don’t want to leave. Even when he doesn’t want this r/s anymore. Even when we can’t see where this is going. 

He says I’m selfish, selfish that I just keep wanting him to change. Is that really true? The change isn’t just a change in a bad temper – but an action that is fundamentally wrong to be done by someone who is in a r/s, who should stay committed and responsible. If this continues, I can’t stop being paranoid. I can’t trust him again and again if he chooses to stay like this. How to trust when whenever I trust him, but when I do check upon him – I get to see what I don’t want to see the most? It hurts, I feel that I’m torn apart. I can accept it as his past, but I can’t accept him not willing to change. Not because he sees it wrong or what, but it is affecting us. If he really wants the r/s, wouldn’t he put in effort too? He said he is tired of putting in effort when I can’t just give him some peace. But how to stop thinking when it’s not stopping.
Now, since he doesn’t want to change or hang onto this r/s, it’s just me – ultimately, whether I can accept his actions, and let it be there without ever turning to him and ask him to change. What should I do? I can't let go of a love that I hold so dear. I'm tired too. I'm not asking him to change completely, I just wish that he If he would compromise and try, I would try my best not to act up too. I really am trying but he can’t see it. And because it is true, we have been quarrelling nonstop in the past few weeks. What can I do if I want to keep this r/s? No trolls please.

1407,"Hi all,

I've been in an LDR since June. My boyfriend and I had been together for only 2 months before he left for further studies in the US. While we were both in Singapore, he was extremely attentive and we talked everyday, even if it was just to chat about each other's day.

After he left, however, he became a lot less attentive. He would reply whenever I texted him, but he never initiated any conversation with me - I always had to take the first step. Also, we have Facetimed only once in the months that he has been away.

I understand that he is very busy in his course and the time difference is a huge obstacle, so I'm not sure if I'm asking too much. 

Given that ours is a young relationship, I'm not sure if it's reasonable for me to be so insecure. I suppose the fact that he's older than me (he's in his mid-30s) means that he's a lot more secure in his needs and wants, and maybe he's just not the type who needs that much interaction with his significant other. 

 I don't want to come off as immature and clingy, but a small part of me is also starting to think that I deserve the best (we all do!) and maybe it's not him.

At least for the first few times, being seen as generous and spontaneous is an important feel good factor for girls. It could easily go the other way and get you labelled with terms like ""calculative"" especially for cheaper items.

The important caveat here is not to allow yourself to be taken granted for in the long term. Generally have a sense of whether the girl have a sense of responsibility to share the cost sometimes. If they don't it's a major red flag for:

1. They are probably still receiving a lot of attention from other guys and actively exploring and comparing between you and others. At the start this is fine, but not healthy at all for the long term. This generally happens for girls that are still below 26 years of age.
2. The girl is a full-blown princess. Some people can accept this, but I believe most probably can't and shouldn't.

In those situations, just continue to be gentlemanly and generous for the remaining days but cut off the relationship cleanly.

I'm currently dating this girl and she told me that she will never allow me to send her home, not even to the MRT. Even when we study, we would only do it in school. I suspected that she had another boyfriend until I ask her after almost 2 months why she won't let me send her home or know her address. She told me she has trust issues because a guy she was with almost 2 years back stalked her home and cabbed down regularly to her house even though he stays in the North. She lives in the East. He would call her almost 20 times just to make her leave the house regardless what time it is to meet him whenever he wants to meet. She got so paranoid that even the mention of his name can get her into a panic attack. He would also inappropriately touch her and asked for sex even though she refused. (Yes she has seek the help from police but they didn't do much for her.) 

I really really like this girl and I would do anything for her. I definitely won't treat her the way that guy did and I really want her to trust me but it seems like even after  6 months together she still wouldn't tell me where she lives or invite me over to her place.

So it was the first lecture of a particular module today and the lecturer was very engaging. She made us form into groups of 5/6s today to introduce ourselves to one another and since another guy and I were sitting at the far end of the table, we only form a group of 2, me and him. It was a little awkward as usual, as all of us were strangers. So he started the convo by introducing himself and I carried on.

After a short introduction, the lecturer started teaching and gave us some time to discuss certain questions after that. But girls beside me already form their own group since the ice breaker, so it's once again the guy and I. I was sort of awkward so I didn't look at his direction, avoiding all eye contact and any chance to discuss the question. So both of us just waited for the lecturer to continue. The second time this happened, he went out to get some food so once again, we didn't discuss.

After I reach home, I felt like I probably like him (ish). Maybe a crush? Or an eyecandy? So I started regretting how I avoided all the discussion opportunities.

So this woman here, is determined to reach the LT early next friday and strike a casual convo with him since i found out we had similar courses, which i forgot to ask which other mods he was taking. How dumb of me. Anyways, I just want to know if that guy would be freaked out by me. I'm just afraid he thinks I'm a weirdo who sorta ignored him the previous week but strike up a convo the following week.

P.s I'm only gonna do this if he is early for lectures because he was damn freaking early today. Im guessing he had a lesson way before the lecture we had. And if it goes well, I'll probably ask if he wants a study buddy for that module and the same module we failed last year. 

P.s.s yes, I'm an evergreen of 21 years and I'm sick of it. I want to change my fate this time round. How does my plan sounds guys?? Can give me some additional advice or encouragement. I scared i will chicken out eh how?? :'(

1437,"I met my bf in a dating app. BTW, we're both ajs. And since I am not a resident in Singapore, I told him of my plans pursuing a resident visa somewhere else. Although, initially he has reservations about LDR since it was the same scenario with his ex bf. But still he was and is supportive of my plans. 

He also decided to apply resident visa so we both can live happier life together.

After a few months later, I received the resident grant. Since all my siblings are already waiting for me there. They asked if I can immediately immigrate but I delayed since I still want to spend time with my bf for more than a year. At this time, I have not come out of the closet. Since I was scared of how they will react. Same goes to my bf.

At the start of our relationship, we are open to watch porn and relieve our carnal desires if either one of us is unavailable. But we never set boundaries. Such as sexting other people and sending nsfw pictures. Since, I thought this should not have been discussed and a general rule when you're exclusively dating.

Before our first anniversary I came out to my parents and siblings. Which was welcomed with different reactions. As usual my mum is against it but was glad my dad and siblings are supportive. He followed suit and told his mum and sister. Same scenario with both of our mothers but his sibling is so understanding.

So the day came when I have to fly and leave Singapore, which was hard since this was my second home and especially of bf. At the first six months away from each other. Our conversation would start with good morning and end with good night. But most of the time would have video sex.

But there are times when I called him crying due to lovesickness. And if what's the status of his application for resident visa as well. However due to stricter immigration rules and constantly changing visa quota he is still uninvited to apply. But we are still hopeful he will get invited  one day.

This year, to streamline our plans, he decided to look for a firm which has a headquarters in the country I immigrated. And he was able to get an offer and will be trained for two weeks. Which was the best and worst in our relationship.

We never argued about anything in our 2 years relationship, only then when I found out something.

One day when he was at work I opened his tablet, with his permission to use. And accidentally saw his twitter account. There I found his pictures flaunting his body and suggesting some indecent posts. To my surprise he has a number of followers too.

Which then lead me to dig for other messages, emails and other multi media. To my surprise he re opened some dating apps and was exchanging pictures and naughty messages.

At that night I confronted him and he told me he will no longer open those apps.

To his defense, he told me he only open those apps when I am out of reach due to time difference. And after messaging those guys he would no longer message them.

Even though he said he will not open those apps, I still have this feeling of infidelity. And would sometimes be the fuel of our argument lately.

This has affected my mental state and physical well being due to seeking closure in this chapter of our relationship.

He always remind me that he loves me and promises not to do it again. 

Although there's a good thing that came out of this. Ever since this happened. We constantly call each other and ignited our relationship.

But there are times when I feel depressed and be cold and distant to him. Which he'll notice immediately and will try to appease ans resolve my doubts and anxiety.

Then lately I found out he opened a dating app a month before my departure. Although he gave me the passwords and username of all his dating apps. Reading previous messages to other guys just haunt me. Which is also my fault for digging in.

It is hard for me to let go of the past since I felt betrayed but I know this will only strengthen our relationship. With his assurance, I believe in him. But told him if he ever do it again. No more second chance.

I know this will not be the biggest hurdles we have to face. One of which, once he will get a visa he will have to inform his mum about his plans to follow me. This would devastate both our mothers but we just want to live life and follow what makes us who we are and live a a happier life in a country who supports us. Plus the thought that their only sons would not marry a girl and have a normal life.

To all the readers, thank you for reading my post.

Everytime we discuss, i  always stay quiet and even when i contribute i always say It so unconfidently. Its not that I dont know my stuff because I can contribute when we split the work, but somehow I just cant during a group discussion. Its not that I'm shy either, because I seem to be able to build good relationships with my project mates and I am very talkative if we aren't discussing the project. I'm not unconfident about my intelligence as well as I've gotten pretty decent grades my entire life. I really want to contribute to the project discussion because I feel bad and don't want to be a freeloader, but I dont know what's stopping me.

Has anyone faced this issue or can anyone give some advice? Thanks.

Have you guys ever experienced this, seeing someone you love having trouble in their relationship and you couldn’t do anything about it. The only thing you can do is to sit down at the mall for hours and think of ways to make her happy and smile. The pain inside my heart is hard to explain. You guys must be thinking, this is not my job to do all this. But trust me, when you really care about someone you will start doing silly things like this. We hangout a lot, and we talked about how his bf treated her. Her bf is an asshole. Every time when she need her bf to be there for her, he is not there. Her bf think he a smart ass, and he has this stupid pride or ego issue. He always think he is right. (Very 大男人). He make me feel like he think that he better than a lot of people. To let’s everyone reading this post to relate how  stupid he is. He is that kind of people you wouldn’t wanna be Friend with and also like giving him one big slap on his face. (Just start thinking someone you hated)

Seem like he already lost interest with my girl Friend and didn’t care about her at all. He didn’t even bother to do basic bf stuffs like sending and fetching gf.  He didn’t make time for her. The only thing he do is to sweet talk via text and my girl Friend will be fine with it. I told her this relationship won’t workout, unless her bf putting more effort. She doesn’t wanna breakup with his bf because It is also hard for her to let go. Sometime letting go is better than hurting yourself. 

Anyway if you follow NUS posts, I will like to explain what is the meaning of IRCAU. Which mean, I REALLY CARE ABOUT “U”

1441,"Dear friends,

I am gay. Yesterday I came out to my parents. I had just had an argument with my boyfriend and we broke up. I wasn’t in the right frame of mind and so I just decided to go ahead and come out to my parents. 

I expected them to be tolerant. Instead of that what I got was being chased out of the house. 

I slept at the HDB staircase last night. All I have with me are my phone, wallet and charger, a bag with some clothes and a water bottle. I’m fine right now, i use the charging ports and free WiFi at the mall nearby and I’m able to refill my water bottle/wash my face at the toilet. 

What do I do now? I’m really confused, hurt, and I hate myself - I feel suicidal. I’m a student, I don’t have much money and I don’t know how much longer I will be able to sustain myself. I feel like calling the police and asking them to bring my to IMH (at least I will have a place to stay). 

The other option is to go to a shelter but I don’t know how to go about doing that and I just feel helpless and lost. I feel alone. 

If you have read this, thank you for taking the time to read through it. 

TLDR: I’m homeless, broke, gay, suicidal and I have no idea what to do now.

1444,"Whenever my boyfriend hangs out with his relatives, they’ll just sit there after a meal and let him pay (and no they don’t pay him back after). My bf will always take the initiative to go make payment/settle the bill, be it for meals, movies tickets, activities on their travels etc. And if you’re wondering whether it’s because my bf is richer or earn more, nope they make about the same.  I earn way less than my bf and his relatives yet I offer to pay half the time and he lets me but doesn’t let them. His relatives are just really thick skinned. I have tried talking to my bf about it but he gets very defensive because his relatives are his priority and he’s totally willing. Perhaps it’s not my place to say who he should or shouldn’t pay for cos afterall I’m an “outsider”. But I fear that such habits will go on after we get married. To make things worse, they hang out very often, about a few times a week so he squanders a lot of money on them each week. I find it hard to accept a husband who squanders away hard earned money on his able bodied relatives with equal earning capability in the long term. Should I break up with him and is this be a dealbreaker for anyone else? Would really appreciate some advice.

1445,"This is a long post. My bf and I (both 21) have been together for 2 years. He’s midway serving NS while I’m working full time. 

I feel that my bf is being complacent in our rs. E.g. I’m always the one putting effort to make him happy and he doesn’t. He didn’t use to be like this.

I would understand if he’s busy with NS commitments and I thought that NS is a full-on tough 2 years. However, it isn’t much for him. He’s been very free in recent months and tells me he spends most of his day playing games and being on his phone. Isn’t it ironic: when he was busier during BMT and etc. he put in so much more care and effort towards me like texting me as much as he can and going out on dates. Now that he’s free, he doesn’t even drop me a text until to say goodnight. He’s not just free in terms of time, mind you, he can even leave his camp in civil clothes for lunch/dinner everyday which means he can go anywhere to waste some hours away in the day. I’m always wondering what he’s really doing with all his free time instead of giving me just a little bit of it. Is there someone else or he simply doesn’t care about me anymore? 

Not counting the times we go out to have meals because human beings need to eat, it’s been months since we went out. Every weekend is the same routine: I go to his home and Netflix, have sex and actual chill. Sometimes no Netflix even, just sex and chill. Am I just a bootycall or what? 

The only love I feel from him is all the sweet words he says like ily, I can’t live without you, I wanna marry you.... you get the drift. I give him everything he wants and my duty as a gf, time, intimacy, reassurance and occasional gifts and help whenever he needs anything. I’ve even jeopardised some important things to me just to make him happy but I won’t dwell into that.

I’m so envious of my friends and co-workers who are in rs and the gfs are being treated so well. I told a few close friends of mine and they react to my story with a look of pity. I’m not demanding to be treated like a princess, I just want to be treated decently like a gf. There are guys in my workplace expressing their interest in me and treating me better than my bf, but I love my bf and and I don’t want to give up on our rs. 

I wish he can reflect on our rs and change. This is a basic bf duty and I don’t think I should tell him step by step how to be a decent bf. Haiz... NSF guys, please don’t be like this to your GFs... We are the ones on the losing end if you waste our 2 years waiting for you just to be treated like this...

If you read this far, any opinion/advice would be greatly appreciated.

Btw if you follow NUSWhispers posts, I’m Carol mentioned in a post before. 

TLDR; I feel my boyfriend is taking me for granted. I give him everything he wants, he doesn’t put in effort like I do, and he makes me feel like I’m just FWB to him rather than a GF.

My bf and I are in our late 20s and just got together a few months ago. Since then, to be very honest, I’ve been having difficulties getting over his past relationships and sexual history. He’s more experienced in this aspect than me, having had 4 ex gfs and a number of one night stands previously, as compared to me having only 2 serious relationships before I met him (and never been on casual relationships / one night stands before). Sometimes the thought of him doing romantic and intimate stuff with his exes randomly cross my mind and make me feel uneasy. Even when we’re going about our daily lives, I’m sometimes bothered by such thoughts e.g.while having nice dinner out, I’ll wonder if he has taken his exes to the same place that we are eating. Same goes when we are trying new activities together or travelling. I even went to the extent of stalking his exes on social media and felt even worse after seeing that some of them are relatively good looking, and some still keep their couple photos with my bf.
I haven’t voiced out this issue to my bf as I’m scared it might cause unnecessary arguments that jeopardise our new relationship. Moreover, I also feel bad for opening up to him, as he has been really nice and loving to me so far, always around when I need him, always reassuring me that he loves me a lot and that he is very thankful to have found me.

I would like to say that I was and still am a beta person according to their criteria. But let me give you ""beta"" people an advice. You must have a goal and a burning passion for something in life. Let me tell you that once you have found this goal, you won't have time to worry about not getting a gf/bf cause you will have a bigger goal now. I excel in my passion and im one of the best in my country. People ask for my autograph when they see me in conventions. (It's a gaming hobby that i picked up 7 years ago). People might say ""oh you are the best cause you are smart"". I'm not even smart, my CGPA is only 2.4 and I am slow in learning. but what made me achieve my goals is my passion and the attitude to never give up rather than me being born smart. You have to put your goal above everything else except family. I hope the ""beta"" people here takes my advice and try to work on finding a goal and purpose.

We met because of my CCA and I took it upon myself to show her the ropes in hopes she would do well and I slowly found myself falling for her. We would even conduct extra practice sessions over the weekends and I gladly did it as it was an excuse to see her I guess. But she decided to quit as she couldn't juggle studies and this CCA as it takes up a ton of commitment. But even after she left, we continued talking and met up occasionally. But everything went downhill when I confessed to her one day, she said she did not want a relationship and we actually stopped texting soon after.

I went about my life for the next two years but never sought out a relationship with another person, but we got in contact again due to an insta story reply and we actually started hanging out frequently again. I found out later she found a boyfriend about a year ago from her friend but she never did mention him to me, and that made me realise whenever we hung out she never leaves any social media footprint, even when we did go to her favourite places and i've seen her take tons of pictures and post them when she goes there with her other friends.

I am in a really confusing place right now, on one hand I know I love her and I make it clear to her my feelings towards her have never changed for the last 3 years, yet on the other she is in a relationship now and she still gladly hangs out with me which I feel is wrong.

I'm from the CoffeeMeetBagel guy and hope I can enlighten you. The fact is, when people say you look ok, it won't get you girls. When people say you're good-looking, you barely made it looking 'ok' for the girls. Never doubt yourself if you're good enough for her or not, be confident, if you think she's in your league, go for it. But manage expectations, don't aim for a 8/10 if you're a 4/10, practically speaking. Yes, it can happen, if you have charisma. Good-looking people also have our own problems, it's like an express pass to girls, but in the long-run, we still face similar problems other couples experience. I wouldn't advise going on dating apps if you're looking for a potential someone. Go to events, meet people in real life, speak to them, it's better. Dating apps are cruel, and tbh I wont reply to most that I matched. All the best mate, hope love finds you.

One day there was this online gathering, and I decided to attend since I have many online friends there and thought it would help me get through life a bit. From there, I met this girl. It wasn’t love at first sight, heck I was even trying to stop myself from falling in love with her since you know, suicide and also I was never in a relationship. But we bonded so well, she knew all of my secrets, even those i never told my 2 closest friends. She helped me through my depression. Gave me support, hang out with me. Said thingd like “I love you” but as a friend. holding hands, kisses on the cheek. Those 3 weeks was the most happy I have been in my entire life. She gave me a reason to live. She made me want to live. 

However, in later time I realised, she suck at love. Cause a few weeks after that initial “Happiest time of my life”, she started saying she have feelings for another man. Which I can’t do anything about since we were never officially together. All I can do is wish her a happy life. But we promised to stay as best friends. However, slowly be depression started to deteriorate again, which officially ended relationship with 3 of my best friends. Those 2mentioned prior and the girl i was in love with. So I shut myself off from life for a period of a month or so. Come back to found out she found another boyfriend. Then i realised, she suck at love she cant stay commited to a single person. Because of that, many of her victims suffered.

Please make a police report if you have not; there's a 99% chance that the guy took upskirt photo or video of you. Trying to warn other girls on NUSWhispers probably won't help as much as you taking action.

Personally I've experienced the same before (hence the anonymous response to you). Barely anybody on the escalator yet this foreign nationale stood two steps behind me. I found it strange but I didn't do anything... until I felt something brushed against my thigh. Turned over, saw his phone camera facing upwards. Asked him what was he doing and he denied doing anything but while he was trying to hide his phone, I saw that the camera mode was on. Demanded he hand over his phone to prove that he didn't take photos of me, he resisted and tried to flee. But I held onto his mobile phone tight and tackled him. I called him out and yelled for help. Even though the public just stood around to watch the show, nobody helped, I managed to nab him and eventually he got deported. I still feel ashamed that I'm a target of such a crime but at least those photos never made it to anywhere and he can't harm other girls in this country ever.

Do yourself justice and report to the police, please.

To the lady, we hope you are okay. Any life saved is better then any lost. I hoped this post served as an encouragement for more students to be CPR and AED trained.

1486,"Hi, I am a NUS alumni doing an AI-led math startup. I am not sure where to ask for help exactly, since my social network is limited and I need help urgently, hence I am giving NUSWhispers a go. We just trained our AI to do university math and it generates university math questions now (multivariate calculus). It is a mixture of deductive reasoning and templates.

Would any math student be willing to work part time proof-reading the generated questions and answers? You will be well-compensated and your job is to find issues. If you are willing, please comment and I will contact you. Really appreciate it.

1487,"Hi OP of #69729

I’m really sorry to hear about your situation. You sounds very exasperated and all of this is obviously wearing down on you. 

Having said that though, I highly recommend you seek a marriage counsellor like many have suggested. And that should be the only advice you take from NUSWhispers. Not saying there’s no good advice here, but when it comes to marriage, both parties should be involved as much as possible, and marriage counselling allows an impartial third party to hear from both sides and mediate discussions between both parties(so your wife can’t just walk out of it and end the discussion then). If you want to talk to discuss to friends and family about it by all means, but take their advice with a pinch of salt since they only heard your side of the story. All the best OP

1488,"I am the op of #69729. Firstly thanks to the comments and advices.  I wish I could say more but thousand of words can't write my piece of story. 

I want to add on, at first I think it was post/pre natal depression too so I decided to endure and tolerate and I even blame myself for trying to argue with her.  I tried to give in but no avail.  When she wants to explode she will find 101 ways no matter what I do.  A very good example is 1.5month after labour she still has discomfort. She complained to me and I to comfort her by assuring her that I saw the wound it's nothing serious and I believe she is in pain . Prior to that I everyday check on her wound and ask her about it and tell her I will arrange for a day within the week to bring her to consult a doc in a nice tone. I even told her I'm worried about her wound not healing up proper.  

Next instance she began blaming me.  Saying that the pain Is still there and I can't do anything.  Even if sees the doc they will still make the wound pain and she can't take it. Throwing a tantrum at me thereafter, end up I got angry and ask her so what she wants me to do? I began doubting myself.  

Similar story was during one of the check up in hospital during her pregnancy. She was going for glucose test that needs to prick her finger.  I told her pricking of finger IMO is better than drawing blood from the arm.  The pain is lesser to me. She argued and say that I am wrong.  Pricking of finger is much more painful than drawing blood from the arm. 
She then stands up and walk away in the midst debating.  She said I don't understand her.  I am not the one feeling the pain. She make big fuse in the hospital by scolding the nurses and doctor over little things. Scolding me loudly and took off our wedding ring wanting to dispose it.The doc got angry and wanted to cancel our package with them, upon hearing she toned down. 

I have a few ex lovers before but all are already blocked and removed from my life. I didn't cheat on her before and work towards this rls wholeheartedly.  I've took responsible for the accidental pregnancy and took on the roles. Her parents are very good and understanding BTW, they know their daughter personality and thank me for giving in everytime.  

I have deprived of sleep for couple of mths with only 3-4 hrs for most days. And i can't concentrate on anything. I have work, the baby and her to take care of. I gave my best but she feels insufficient. 

I posted here because I am lost. In the end I don't know what decision I will make. It's too hard and many things are into consideration. I just wanna read advices. Thanks and sorry for the long post again.

1490,"Replying to #69717: I got an abortion earlier as well, and it was a very fast and easy process. I also don’t regret any of it, and don’t feel any guilt at all- so the guilt part depends on the person. If you wish to know more, try searching online, there’s a reddit thread where a lady details her abortion process. The doctor I got was really nice, though, and the clinic really treated me with respect.

1491,"Hey guys, I need some advice on this. Please don't judge.. Couple months ago, I broke up with my ex, also my first serious relationship and he isn't local. Reason is because of cheating before and during my pregnancy which I eventually terminated as a result of him convincing everyone to force me to terminate and also he was being friendly with his married ex at that time. I suffermed from depression thereafter dropping out of school. I left him after realizing he did not change and that people around him started terming me a psycho.
Now he came back to me claiming that he is sincere and wants a chance. I rejected as I feel that he is a chronic liar and this rejection made his family send me hate messages about how I should be liable for him.
I suggested we be friends as it is impossible for us to be in a relationship as it has taken a toll on my health and people around me. He has been rather insistent in his attempts to forge a relationship with me, going as far as to waiting outside my home. I agreed to meet up with him and realized what he wanted was sex. I rejected him and told him that I will never agree because of what happened in the past and also because he has not changed.
A few days ago, he told me that he is returning home and proceeded to block me. I do admit to having a soft spot for him even though I am sure that I no longer wish to be with him as it is highly stressful being the one always giving in. I am somewhat worried and I am unsure at what he is playing at. Any advice on what I should do? This has been hurtful for me so I appreciate only legit advice. Thank you

1492,"Ok I'm gonna need some opinions from u guys.
I've known this guy for a year plus and we met in school. I find him cute and I was interested in him when I first knew him. But he just wants to bang me, like literally. He has been asking me to be his fwb for a year. 
I've always been rejecting him even tho I'm actually attracted to him both physically and sexually. He's soft spoken and has a super sweet smile. He doesn't mind doing boyfriend stuffs for me such as carrying my bags, lending me his jacket, sending me off to the busstop and stuff like that since we hang out often. It's cute but I know the motive behind all these things so I don't really have strong emotions about this.
Until that night, I got super drunk and spent the night with him. To be honest, his performance was meh even though I understand he was the one doing all the actions plus it was an unexpected situation so maybe he got too excited? Anyway, this is not the point. Even though his performance was average, he cuddled with me the whole night, sent me home the next day and acts normal as how we usually act as friends.
Here's the question. Should I continue doing this or just let it be as a one time thingy? Tbh, I don't wanna turn myself into  into a girl who has fwbs even tho there's nth wrong with being one. At the same time, I admit I'm attracted to him. And since I had bad experiences with relationships, so I've staying single for a while, I feel like I kinda need this pleasure too. So how ah?

She a very independent type of person and sometimes loner in the sense she wants to do things by herself. Despite this , we still manage to be good friends. However, 2 years ago when she got a bf, we basically stopped talking because when she has a bf or good friend, she will sorta abandon her other friends. She broke up recently and we started talking again. However, recently she uses apps to talk to guys and doesn’t really text me anymore. She only texts me to tell me about herself and her guy situations. I feel like a backup friend. I feel when she gets a bf she will just abandon our friendship. I’m not sure what to do. Please advice.

1500,"I am already attached. There is a guy in my course who is smart but quiet. One day, I initiated a conversation with him, and after that he became interested in me. He would initiate a conversation by pretending that he needed my help with study. Initially, I was happy to discuss study with him because he is smart. After a while, I started to feel that he was just finding excuses to talk to me, as he is much smarter than me that he doesn't really need my help. In fact, whenever he discussed study with me, he reminded me that I am not smart, which hurt my self confidence. He is not interested in me romantically, he is just too lonely and he needs to talk to someone, but I really hate discussing study with him. I tried talking to him about other things not related to study, but he has a tendency to report to me what he does daily which makes the conversation boring. Are there better things I can do besides ignoring him?

1502,"In response to confession #69680, congrats on getting matched on Tinder! I am a guy, also evergreen and a virgin. I started using dating apps (CMB & Tinder) 3 months ago, but have no matches so far. Is it common for a guy to get zero matches, or is it just me? Any advice to get matches? I have reviewed my profile and asked for friends' advice too. Didn't work out.

While I don't want to give away my virginity just yet, I would very much like a companion so that we can do awesome stuff together. Every time I read NUSWhispers, I'm in awe about the crazy sex life people are having. Some even managed to bang their gf's sister spontaneously. Damn. I wonder, are these confessions true, or are they just students' plethora of fantasies?

1504,"So I've been dating my gf for 1 year now, and I ran into a little bit of trouble. She has a sister who is 2 years younger than her. 

So last week when I was at her house alone with her sister, she asked me for help with her homework but somehow it led us to having sex in the living room. It was sooo amazing that it was pretty even with the sex I have with my girlfriend. She agreed that she wouldn't tell her Sister (my gf) and that if I ever wanted more, I could come back any time. 

Now I feel partly guilty for cheating, but I also feel extremely excited because it gives me a thrill, especially when her sister is so hot and sexy. But now I don't know what to do, keep having sex with her in secret, or tell my gf the truth. 

Both choices are hard to make. Any advice?
