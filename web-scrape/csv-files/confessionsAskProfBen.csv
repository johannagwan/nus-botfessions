I am in my final year in NUS and wanted to take up CS modules to aid me in my jobhunting. I currently have CS2030 and 2040, and am looking to drop one of them (and maybe take as guest?). Any advice on which would be more helpful (grades aren't that important to me)? 2030 seems to be more focused on styles but 2040 seems to be more technical. Thanks!

2,"I recently got back in contact with an old acquaintance whom I used to be rather close with. 

Ever since we knew each other,i was aware that he is married and was constantly hitting on me. I hadn't try hard to avoid his advances as the relationship was beneficial to my career advancement. 

Since then, I went away and recently came back and he again tried to get back in touch. I am well aware what he has in mind but I came to know that his wife is currently pregnant. I start to feel disgusted at his doings, and really pity the wife. I have also since stopped contacting him. But I'm unsure if I should tell his wife about this sickening behaviour especially they have been trying for years to conceive. And now that they finally got somewhere, I thought the guy would wake up from his idea and spend more time with his partner. But apparently he hasn't. I'm sure he will just start to someone else, if not me. I'm really lost as I feel both guilty and pity his partner. Please give me some advice.

3,"To confession #75084, 

I was bullied in Primary school. But I could not rmb what happened. I had suppressed part of my memory. Till now, I often have weird dreams about what actually happened.

I was bullied in secondary school. I was cyberbullied by my cca friend. And because of this, I became a weird person. I hate people approaching me. I hated myself and I tortured myself. I felt that no one really understand how I feel. I got really scared to make friends with people. Some of classmates made friend with me, but after telling them a small little secret which isn’t even true, they just spread hurtful words around in school. And because of that, I was famous in school and everyone hated me. I felt that I became a loner myself. I got very affected in my studies that I could not concentrate easily. 

When I went to ite, my senior that was in the same secondary school as me, spread gossips about me in class. Ended up everyone hated me and I became a loner myself. In my second yr, my sec sch senior even said a gossip about me right in front of me. I hated her. I wanted to give her a tight slap. And I have one sentence for her: YOU HATE ME, I HATE YOU TOO!! 

Now in poly, no one in the class seems to be willing to make friends with me. I am always quiet in class. And it seems very difficult for me to step out of my comfort zone. Cos the moment I step out, everyone starts judging me. Nevertheless, I am not gonna step out of my zone. Wish me all the best. A lot of people told me I need to step out of my comfort zone some day. But, I refused to. I only want to say: what’s the point of stepping out of my zone when everyone like to judge me about what I do? CANT YOU JUST LOOK AT YOURSELF AND JUDGE YOURSELF BEFORE YOU EVEN GIVE THE HECK TO JUDGE OTHERS? I KNOW IM A LONER, BUT WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU CAN JUDGE ME AND GOSSIP ABOUT ME AS AND WHEN YOU WANT? I HELPED YOU AND YOU GOSSIPED ABOUT ME. IS THAT HOW YOU THANK ME FOR HELPING YOU? IF THATS THE CASE, I MIGHT AS WELL DONT HELP YOU!

4,"As someone who graduated from university some years back, I can't stress enough the importance of having a good mentor. I wasn't from NUS, but my mentor was. You see, my mentor was the longtime CEO of the company I work in and he was a Jack Welch-type figure here. Suffice to say, many of our company's businesses were built up by him.

I was not his original protege. It was another person. Let's name him X. X was originally the COO to my mentor and was slated to take over when my mentor retires. However, X was caught dabbling in some backdoor transaction. My mentor then ousted X and made me his heir-apparent. After some time, my mentor retired and I took over as CEO. My time finally came, or so I thought.

Not long after I took over as CEO, X managed to return to the board of directors by convincing some shareholders to support him. However, I once again found X dabbling in yet another backdoor transaction, so I ousted him from the company again. I also tried to form some joint ventures with our smaller but more nimble competitor for synergies and got a foreign conglomerate to invest in our company. This must have incensed my mentor for he hated our smaller competitor. I am unsure how it happened but some company money somehow landed in my personal bank account. You don't look at the gift horse in the mouth, so I decided to spend the money to pamper my wife instead of on myself.

On the pretext that I somehow lined my pockets with company money, my mentor is now conspiring with X to oust me at the next shareholders' meeting. My wife is also not helping as she keeps wanting to advise me and repeatedly emphasises that I am the CEO with the power to snuff out this conspiracy asap. It's vexing and I now regret having treated my mentor with gratitude. To all you young ones, please open your eyes wide and clear when following someone as a mentor.

I don't suppose you students have an answer to corporate shenanigans, so I just need your help for a simpler question: my friend wants to buy either a yacht or a submarine as his latest toy. Which should he buy?

8,"I'm the OP of #74946, the one asking for ways to counteract workplace favouritism.

To provide abit more context (I really want to solve this issue I guess):

- No, my boss and Person A are not sleeping together FOR SURE. They are the same gender, both got their own families with children. 

- I've actually been with the firm for 5 years already. Person A has been with the firm for 6.5 years. For a mere 1.5year difference, I don't think the ROI matters that much. In fact, I was at my previous firm for 2.5 years and being with my current firm double the number of years speak volumes about my willingness to stay and stick around. To allay my boss' distrust, I've mentioned multiple times that I won't leave and I'm also bonded (the firm pays for all my upgrading qualifications, which I've continuously been taking for the past 5 years to better prep myself while Person A didn't) as a sign of my commitment. 

- And yes, I talk to my boss whether it's work-wise or personal-wise or career-wise. I have multiple projects with my boss. My boss knows my ultimate career goal - communicated it across several times, knows I'm working hard towards it and I will personally schedule time to talk about career progression, my views on the team (I already lead one), how we can do better, and just general catch up on life - I do notice that these sessions seem to be abit one-sided though, like it's coming alot more from my own proactiveness and initiative. Of course Person A does it too, but the boss always seem more receptive (like in a better mood after coming back from these coffee sessions with Person A).

- I've also tried being ""hard to replace"" like how one commenter mentioned - I put my hand up most frequently, do the projects that no one wants to do, standby during public holidays, help out with business development and things generally to be done outside of work hours (otherwise known as saikang lol), help out whenever the team is busy, and my juniors have given me glowing reviews year after year. These are things that Person A does not have. 

It has come to a point where I feel that I've tried hard and things are stagnated, for reasons beyond my comprehension and control. I'm really unsure what else I have to do to appease my boss, and sometimes I feel like a slave/taken for a ride. 

Tts why I feel that at the end of the day, nothing I've done will satisfy my boss, and nothing I do moving forward will. I'm not sure if anybody here has ever been in my shoes and managed to turn things around, if so, would really love to hear from u. Oh and thanks for reading, oops another long post.

9,"How do u tell whether a boss is practicing favouritism in the workplace and how do u counteract that?

Headsup, this is quite a long post ahead. 

I am an executive working in a global firm. There are also 4 other executives (ie same rank), and we are all quite similar in terms of educational background, with 1 - 2 yrs difference in age. The skillsets we have are also broadly the same, but  because we work on different projects, there are some differences in the kind of exposure and experience we had.

I've noticed that my boss is particularly nice to one of the executives (let's just call the person A). Now don't get me wrong, my boss is generally friendly and will smile/talk to others in a calm manner, not like those horrible bosses u see in movies.

By acts of niceness I mean: by giving A opportunities to speak up, only asking for A's views in meetings, letting A run the bigger projects most of the time, following up with A when A comes back from holidays and asking A whether A feels overwhelmed, need more staffing resources etc etc.

Even though it feels like my boss sometimes 'wakes up' and treats the other executives better as well (like asking if we also need resources or spends effort coaching us), I can't help but feel that boss prefers A based on the number of times that boss is nice to A. I am guessing that it is because the only difference between the rest of us and A is that - A is homegrown ie has started career in this firm and stayed on throughout. A is not the most experienced (in terms of number of years working in this line) amongst us. This 'loyal' trait is very similar to my boss' own background - staying in one firm throughout, while the rest of us started our careers elsewhere before moving to the present firm. Plus because there was a period of time when we had massive turnover, it seems to me that the boss is afraid of people leaving and therefore feels that only homegrown employees are loyal will stay long and can be groomed.

If this continues, I'm concerned that when it comes to promotions, pay rise and general career progression, the boss will favour A too, since A gets the best exposure, best resources and best learning experience and naturally would perform better. Is this considered favouritism in such situations, and what can I do for myself and my career? Prof Ben, any wise words?

The girl I like says she feels insecurities that ""I'm out of her league"" and that ""I may leave her"" for better girls. She says she feels average and there's no reason for me to like her. 

But I do. I find her attractive in her own way, but love is a funny thing and I find it hard to put it in words. I was taken aback and stunned, I didn't know what to say.  I struggled to give her a reply. I felt like it made her even more insecure that I gave her a general reply. 

How do I make her feel comfortable and trust that I'll not leave her? I feel like she's waiting for me to say something.

14,"I have a problem with my girlfriend and am unsure whether to break up. See, we have been together for some time and it was rather smooth sailing. However lately, she started getting paranoid about lying after seeing some of her cousins’ relationships wrecked because of lying. She even demanded that whoever caught lying in our relationship will be fined by the other person. To reassure her, I agreed.

Then for some ridiculous reasons, she started fining me a few times for “lying”. The most ridiculous fine was when I blurted out during an argument that she spent more time meeting her good guy friends than meeting me. She said I was lying because I didn’t take into account the other time she spent thinking about me but choosing to compare only the time physically meeting. 

I was incensed and demanded that she give me a breakdown on how much time she spent thinking about her good guy friends compared to that spent thinking about me. At this point she said she can give me the breakdown, but she counter-questioned me about my intentions for asking and implied that I don’t trust her even though she always has my back blah blah blah. She still refuses to give the breakdown. 

Should I get out of this relationship? I know I probably still have value on the dating market because some other girl has persistently pursued me (but she has money management issues). But after all, my gf and I have been together for some time and we are familiar with each other. I would rate our rs as a 7/10, but her increasingly paranoid and controlling manner is making me reconsider. Should I break up with her?

16,"Dear Prof Ben and NUSWhispers community,

TLDR; Girl I like seemed to like me back during school term. Ghosted me during vacation. I don't think she's the kind that would use me but who knows. I want to continue whatever we had. Might be awkward if I want but she doesn't. I'm lost. How should I treat her or go about this tactfully? Even just as friends? 

There's this girl that I really like and have been helping her for homework during the semester. We were very close. She was not rejecting my romantic advances, and sometimes even reciprocating. It seemed mutual. I thought we had a thing but it turns out she just completely ghosted me during the vacation. 

We were so close during the semester. I don't understand why she ghosted me. But maybe something happened or maybe she's just not in the mood? To be fair it could have been something I did that made her decide I don't want this guy. Looking back I realise I haven't really showed her feel loved in the way she wanted despite her hints. Maybe I should be understanding and give her the benefit of doubt. She seemed very genuine during the semester. Not like the kind of girl with a motive. 

But right now when I try to talk to her she'll seem cold and uninterested. We used to talk every day. Now she's not initiating convos and when I do, she'll give me one word replies. She seems like she doesn't want this anymore.

Sometimes it makes me feel like I'm just being annoying and I trying to talk to her is just pestering her. It feels stupid trying to talk to her when she doesn't want to talk. I don't know what happened or if it's something I did wrong. 

There'll prob be a lot of comments telling me to 'ditch her, u just got used' and everything but please don't. 

I still want this relationship (or friendship) and I treasure her as a person. I like her a lot. and there's the possibility that she's just going through something. I just don't want to assume that this is over cause it might not be. 

Right now, I don't know how to continue this 'relationship'. It's hard to continue when the other person is making it feel 'one-way' even tho it used not be. And it's hard to let her know how I feel or ask her directly since we are not exactly boyfriend girlfriend. I just hope that this is a misunderstanding and it'll all work out eventually. What should I do? How do I get things to be like the way it used to. How should I treat her or go about this tactfully? Even just as friends?

I, however, broke up with my partner of 3 years over several months ago. I understand that I initiated it, and I dated a few people afterwards. I've met people who used me, played me, and being overly desperate beings (too nice to me),  yet still feel like I couldn't find anyone better than my ex. But I didn't wanna patch back because I felt like we were toxic and I became the worst version of me. 

We both had quite a bad temper and low tolerance in general. Whenever one flared, we would ended up quarreling. I don't see myself growing to be a better person in terms of patience. And I really want a patient person who will not flare up over minor things, and will influence me to be more patient as well.  

However, it made me more wary of love, such that I would want to be more understanding towards my next partner, address whatever issues we have as a mature adult, and help each other grow into the best version of ourselves.

I have been applying for summer internship 2020, and recently received an interview request for 1 out of maybe 10 companies I have applied to after a month.

I actually passed the interview and was offered an internship role with them.

Problem is, it is a small company, and the internship description was minimal. I am not sure if I will be able to learn and benefit from the internship after accepting it. And no other companies have gotten back to me except them.

My CAP is the lower range of 4, and I have only Orbital to show myself off. I am not sure if I should just accept this internship, or reject it and try and apply for other internship that might be more competitive and have more applicants, which gives me less chance to get into them given my mediocre results and experiences :( Side note, this will be my first internship.

He's getting old and I'm concerned about his health. 

How do I convince him to eat properly. He's retired so he stays at home every day and he doesn't want to go out at all

I don't want to argue with him over this. Nor do I want to restrain him by force etc. The best case would be to tactfully convince him to stop. But this is hard.

46,"Hi Prof Ben, 

I ve been wanting to ask this for a while now.

Looking back on having taken CS1101S last sem, and now looking ahead towards taking 2030/2040 next sem, I feel that I did not really learn much actual programming from the CS1101S module. While we did cover some key ideas like abstraction and recursion, I feel that we did not really learn much from the module as a lot of the time was more so spent being thrown a new tool and then left to sink or swim, trying to complete the ""mission"". 

It honestly felt more like an exercise in getting the feel for a new tool, ie the runes missions, then the graph thing, each and every week rather than actually introducing us to new ways of problem solving, through manipulating the ways we interact with the input data to solve the problems.

Why not instead introduce us to the key ideas of computational problem solving skills and at the same time, the appropriate data structures to use to solve such problems instead of separating the two into different modules?

Thanks!

I have a close colleague turned friend whom I have been talking to rather frequently since early this year. We have been out on a few occasions for dinner/meet up as well and also been overseas together for short trips. 

Initially, I did not have any feelings for; but overtime, I have started to realise that I might have developed some feelings (although I’m not entirely certain)- as I do find myself upset when he doesn’t text me for the day and missing him being around me. I myself would not really initiate any conversation as it’s just not me. We are no longer colleagues now but still keep in close contact. 

He has otherwise yet to show any signs that he would like to progress this friendship further. On the other hand, we don’t really talk about relationship issues. However on one occasion, I had briefly mentioned that I did not feel ready for one. 

Do you think it is right if I talked to him about this issue? I’m afraid that it might ruin our friendship and that I might just be the one overthinking? Is it normal for a guy to be so close to a girl? I feel like it is causing me to fall deeper by being so close to me. I’m afraid and confused. I have not told anyone of my friends or family regarding this yet...

So this is the story: I’ve been overseas intern for 3 months and during the first month we still message each other a lot and despite the different in time zone and I still make effort to play her favourite video games. (We been playing for a awhile even before going overseas)

Since this period it looks like she made some new friends from school to play with her and thats totally fine because making friends right?

But the issues is they hang out like almost every single day and since making “these few guy friends” our messages and convo dropped significantly and even when I’m back in Singapore she stopped hanging out with me. I trust her and I told her about how I don’t like that she prioritised her friends over me and I’m willing to make the effort to spent time with her. I’ve also told her that I have friends who are close with the guy and they claim that his flirty and clingy and always looking for target to work on. 

After telling her and we had many quarrels because she felt like I’m controlling her.. and she totally doesn’t believe me and she thinks I’m doing all this because Im jealous.. all I want is to spent some time with her.. am I wrong? It’s been about just over 5 months now, she still comes out with me once in awhile..

I have no idea how valuations work and all. It started out as a cool side project but then people started taking notice and the project was eventually monetized. Now a big company is considering buying my project for huge (6 fig) sum

Part of me wants to just cashout and reap the rewards but part of me also feels like perhaps there is potential for something more? I am lost. I don't know how to decide. 

Is there anyone I can seek advice from or any resources NUS has to help us navigate this journey? Google doesn't help at this point. 

Also, if I suddenly receive a huge sum of money in my bank account, will I alert the authorities? Like will I be questioned on the origin of the money? 

I haven't told anyone as I don't want my friends to see me differently, I still want a normal uni life.

I have been working in my current job close to 2 years. Seeing all my colleague leaving one by one, it always make me feel I should be next.

Pro: Office near my house, flexible timing, able to learn a lot and new skill as the turn over in office is fast. So most of the time I will need to take over their job after they left.

Cons: Low pay(no increase as company didn't have much project, might afraid the next job won't have much increase, based on my current pay), no enough manpower

Would love to have some advice should I continue staying or start looking for new opportunities? I only concern the next job is worst then my current one.

105,"I'm the OP of #72600 . I wanna thank you guys for the advice, feedback and comments. It really means something. Most of you guys mentioned that texting might be the issue, but that's not what I feel? If he wants his space, I would totally respect that, and I'm not one to double text often. I honestly feel like we don't text so much to the extent that he would need his space? He doesn't work much, so most of his time spent were mostly at home, family, and friends. 
So here's an update about what's going on. Feel free to skip if you are too lazy to read! 

He doesn't really enjoys talking about our personal stuff, and he claimed that he is lazy and said he would eventually tell me slowly and surely. He wants to take it slow and see how things goes instead of establishing any title or be in a committed relationship. I pestered him quite a bit to get him to talk about what's going on. He finally told me he isn't ready for a committed relationship, saying that he doesn't like the quarrels and argument that comes with it. I totally understand it and we have never quarreled before, as I don't like to find fault or confront a person directly unless I really need to. 

Also, I feel like he would not be emotionally available for me. That is fine to me as of now, I don't see it as a big issue as I also feel lazy to share about my personal life unless he asked. I just kept assuring him that its ok to be honest with me if I'm just an fwb, or if he isn't serious with me. I told him that I would rather he be 100% honest with me than to toy with my feelings or led me on. However, he kept reassuring me to trust him, that he isn't toying with me. He claims that he just wanted someone by his side. 

Whenever I tried to make plans with him, he seemed uninterested in carrying out and would come up with excuses. The only time he asked me out, was mostly to stayover. He told me he just enjoy chilling at home with me and watch shows, and that he feel that not having sex is fine. However, it still seems shady right? So now, am i safe to say that it's pretty obvious I probably meant nothing to him, and that he might really be toying with my feelings, and just treated me as an fwb? Or should I just trust him?

He confessed to me, but I felt we both needed a bit more time and he was willing to wait. Can tell he really likes me and cares for me, from all the little actions he does, and he's a great person in many ways - good looks, intelligent, ambitious, and we share the same aspirations and values. 

But I have feelings for this other guy. This sounds kind of wrong but I've been secretly going out and getting close with this other guy (but technically we are just friends and friends can still go out). I realise this other guy makes my heart flutter more. I sometimes imagine us being together. He treats me very well too.

What should I do? 

I know the first guy and I are almost like couples, but technically I haven't accepted or rejected him yet so I don't think it's cheating if I go for the second guy? At the back of my mind I know I may regret losing the first guy. But what if the second guy is better?

115,"My girlfriend has depression and anxiety and recently has started to have moments when she wants to cut me off and insist i breakup with her because she doesnt think she deserves someone like me. 
I have stuck with her throughout the 4 months persistently and she says im stupid for doing so, since most people would cut and run.
But it has come to a point where it's tiring to do so. 
Im tired. 
Tired of fighting so hard for someone who doesnt fight as hard for me.

I think i'm selfish for thinking that way. She's going through depression and yet here I am expecting her to put in effort into the relationship. 
I didnt bring this issue of me feeling like I wasnt getting anything out of the RS up to her for a couple of months because i knew she was going through stuff and I didnt want to add on to her burden.

I did my research online and understand that it's normal for people undergoing depression to feel this way sometimes. But it's hard to hold on to a relationship when the other party insists on breaking it off. And even harder when the reason behind it is because she thinks she cant provide me with the things a girlfriend provides because she has depression.


Recently she asked me why i wasnt sharing stuff with her, because i'd want her to share her problems with me, so we could work through it together.
So I finally did. I brought up the issue of me feeling like I wasnt getting anything out of the RS gently, but also didnt tell her because i knew she was going through stuff and I didnt want to add on to her burden.

And she broke down. Went back into this loop of wanting me to dump her. Either that or she would dump me.
I dont know why i'm still fighting so hard for her. Am i dumb to do so? 

I did insist on bringing her to see a counsellor recently after a recent severe suicidal episode.
All i want is for her to be happy again.
But a part of me is feeling really really tired at having to deal with all of this everytime. I tried so hard yet I feel i'm stuck at this same spot with her.

118,"Hi everyone, OP of #72358 here. I've read all of your comments on my original post and am really grateful for the support from this community. Long read ahead.

Just recently things got worse again. Short backstory is that we will be attending a semi formal gathering with many others with banquet dinner and some senior staff involved with performances as well. The dress code is not stated clearly but hearing from other friends who will be attending, many are not wearing formal suits and just wearing button up shirts and formal pants.

As someone who does not like to dress up so nicely as my mentality was that fashion was never a major concern for me growing up, I felt that wearing a collared button up shirt and formal pants was sufficient enough. However, my girlfriend felt otherwise.

She has known that i am really not the type to dress up, all be it that i do dress up nicely when during the appropriate times such as going to a nice restaurant for our anniversary or to a wedding dinner. My schedule had finally cleared up for me to have more free time in the past week and she began asking me what i would wear to the event. She initially suggested for me to wear a suit and a bowtie to match colours with her dress to be cute couple matching kind of thing. I told her as kindly possible that i preferred to wear my original outfit as money is tight for me now while looking for a part time job, but would be open to match colours if i could find the same shirt with the same colour as her dress.

I believe that i was firm with my decision the first time she asked me about it, but i was asked several more times in the past few days about taking on her offer about wearing a bowtie or get a blazer. After telling her that her pestering was getting slightly repetitive since i had told her the same response each time she asked, she took offense to my response and got upset at me quite badly. She ended up sending me a whole string of messages (about 10-15?) but shortly deleted them afterwards and ghosted me until the afternoon of the next day (this took place around night time).

This wasn't the first time this had happened. I couldn't catch all that she wrote as i was away from my phone but caught slight glimpses of what she wrote in some messages. Some of them included ""goodnight this is what we've become i guess"" and ""Sometimes i dont get why its so difficult for you to do (this and that)"". I could get the vibe that she said all of that in the moment, but she had told me previously that when she's drunk or angry her filter goes off and she really tells the truth. Its happened before but this time felt worse than all the others.

The whole commotion ended with me agreeing to her request and got a blazer that matched her dress colour, which further worsened my financial situation now which she knows isn’t doing that good and i could do with saving cash and not spending it on certain unnecessary items. I crumbled under her pressure and gave in.

Side tracking for a bit, a family friend of mine recently passed away by suicide and i told my gf about it and how my family has been affected especially my mum who has teared up at random times just thinking of what happened. I've told her to really stop with the suicide threats and saying about suicide so openly as i believe those who truly feel suicidal tend to not show signs of it, yet she has still continued with the recent meltdown leading up the deleted messages part.

Back to the main topic, I feel that our relationship has been over for a while, but neither of us has taken the step forward to end it properly. From my perspective, it feels as if she would be better off as a person without me. She had previously told me that she would not leave me because she believed that people usually find their soul mate, and she could not understand how people could date more than one person after breaking up with their previous partner/s.

I have suggested taking a break from each other for us to grow and mature, to learn from our mistakes and become better persons for each other. She shot the idea down and said that it was either we were with each other or not at all. I think it is time for me to take the first step for what needs to be done for the better of her and the both of us.

And if you are reading this L, I’m sorry for our lows but thankful for sharing the moments we had with each other, you’ve taught me how to love someone other than my family more than i could ever have. I love you, but it is time for us to be apart and mature for the better of each other and our future partners.

Sometimes she'll seem all enthu while some days she can seem cold. I'm starting to feel insecure myself. I'm really confused whether she is still interested or if she's still considering.

People seem to have no problem when their friends stay in contact with ex classmates and ex hall mates, but they seem to get jealous instantly when their boyfriend/girlfriend stay in contact with ex lovers? 

So it means if I have a new professor in NUS, I cannot stay in touch with my previous form teacher in jc? Because now I have a new teacher and I must “move on” from jc? I am supposed to have a “clean break” from everyone who taught me in school just because I got a new professor? 

So If I make new friends in year two, I must “move on” from old friendships forged in year one? 

Did anyone say,you’re in NUS already, u should “move on” from poly and jc!! No. 
But people say, you should “move on” from past relationships, why? 

How does staying friends with people from my past (primary school friend /old neighbour /secondary school  friend) prevent me from being a good friend to other  university pals?  Do  I  have to cut ties  with former friends?!

If nobody says we should cut ties with former classmates after graduation, nobody says we should we cut ties with former teachers when we leave, why do so many people think the other way for ex lovers? Not ex Teachers, not ex colleagues, not ex classmates, but so specifically ex lovers?

I need some serious advice/perspective to help me with this emotional issue of mine that has been bugging me for years.
My relationship with my parents, my mom especially, is estranged. 
And I would like to have some opinions on how I feel, and hopefully improve things (?).

Ever since young I’ve always felt like no matter what I did and how much effort I put into something, I’m never and never will be enough for them.
To my mom, I’m a loser, I can’t study well, I can’t make money to support myself properly Nor even give her monthly income (as oppose to what she did for my grandma when’s she’s my age - 24).

I wouldn’t say I hate them but I feel so gutted and angered that they were never really there for me, Nor support my goals as their child. To them I’m just a retirement plan in the future, but right now, a free loader living in their space, drinking their water and “taking money” off of them (which comes close to almost zero, less electricity bills?).
They say I’m not contributing to the family and I’m always closed off to myself and selfish.. but I’m truly just emotionally drained.

They were never there for graduations, army POP etc and other larger life events. No birthdays, no celebrations Nor verbal affirmations or even just a simple “I’m proud of you”. All along it’s only harsh remarks about how selfish I am, about how I’m a bad Son and I wouldn’t amount to anything.

I’ve been working since sec sch for pocket money, I paid for my poly fees, and now uni fees and all of my living expenses. Not gonna lie, it’s so so tough to manage a full time job and doing part time classes at night on top of chores at home. I’ve not been doing well for school, and full time job has taken a toll on my studies, I’ve delayed 2 semesters now.. on top of that, I worked for a year after NS to save up $. (I feel like I’m losing out so much to my peers who seems to be doing so well. My female friends have already graduated and the guys, soon to graduate and yet I’m stuck neither here Nor there.)

I feel so anguished - physically and emotionally. I feel like quitting life.

I just wished that they’d see that their Son is working hard and not a lazy bum. At the same time, I need some trust and investment from them to make life a little easier. 
They’re really traditional parents that sees the only way for success is having a degree first and working in the STEM industry. None of those are my passion Nor what I’m good at. 
It’s so hard to fight back and be successful, I wish I have more time and energy to go for more courses and defeat the rat race too. (But it’s so difficult to change the course of my life at this point in time, I need resources that I don’t have.) 

Guys, am I right to be angry at them? I don’t even want to be angry at them.. but I’m so exhausted and tired of these set of cards that’s thrown at me. 

If there’s any advice or opinions on what should I do to better support myself and change my circumstances, please let me know and I’ll do anything.

I look forward to your perspectives. 
Please help me,

Exhausted Son.

Is it wrong for average Joe like me to be attracted to good looking girls?
 
It's really mentally painful and depressing to desire what you cannot have. So, for years, I've been trying all sorts of means to suppress my attraction to good looking girls and to condition my mind to tweak my preference but nothing seems to work.

For example, i tried convincing myself that I'm attracted to a girl who actually isn't my type. Later on, I also told relatives and friends that I'm asexual in an attempt to trick my mind into accepting that I'm actually not attracted to the girls of my type, but that did nothing to help as well.

Does anyone know of any effective methods to suppress my infatuations , be it medical options or better strategies to re-wire the mind? Please help, any constructive advice is really much appreciated. Thanks!

142,"For reasons which are ignorant and stupid, my parents disapprove of my relationship with my GF. Hence I am left with no choice but to elope for the sake of my lifelong happiness. The only question is: when?

Since I am still halfway through my degree, I originally planned to elope after graduation in 2 years time. However, due to visa issues, my GF cannot stay in Singapore that long. In any case, her hometown is a small village so there are few jobs available for uni grads - even my poly diploma is probably overkill. I am confident that since everybody knows everybody in her village, there is no problem finding a job once I arrive. Frankly, I am not a snobbish like other Singaporeans, so I don’t feel the need to waste even more time just to get a useless piece of paper. The quality of education in NUS is not as high as its rankings suggest, so I wont be missing out on much. 

And yet... even though logic dictates that I should drop out of NUS, I am hesitating. Do I just not love my GF enough to make this sacrifice for her? Am I subconsciously being racist and judgemental like my parents? Or am I just a spoilt singaporean brat who prefers material comforts over true love?

I would like to read your take on the following rant, that a so called ethics ""professor"", at NUS spammed his students with just a while ago:
""Dear students

Some of you have complained that your ""friends"" who did not do any appeals are scoring better than you who did the appeals. And you think that's unfair. But you would be mistaken, because you're actually not seeing all the data. We, the teaching team, have that data.

In Week 13, we will show you the data. In the data, we will be able to show you that the students who have constantly gotten snapped, and worked hard to recover from those snaps through the appeals, are the ones currently at the top of the table (right now!). We can't fake these things, it's all in the data.

So, if you got snapped, but your score is the same or less than someone who did not get snapped, then, it is not because it is unfair, it is because you are not good enough. As we will show, the students who are good enough have gotten back more than anyone else, therefore they are at the top of the table. As they should be, because they are just that good, and shouldn't we reward students who have spent the effort, and have really gotten good?

The data always tells the story.

So, get good. Or not, your choice.""

dunno about you guys, but calling anyone ""not good enough"" because of a couple of assignments, seems unethical, unprofessional, and just plain crazy to me. this guy needs to take an ethics class himself, and then check himself into IMH.

As I'm not sure if the field I am interested in are suitable for me or something I would enjoy in the long run and also in terms of the availability of the job opportunities/salary. Hence I thought of studying computer science would be more advisable as it is considered general IT degree and will be able to apply to the UX/UI, multimedia/graphics/illustrator etc field too?

However if I choose to take up a multimedia/graphic course etc, if in the future I am not keen anymore or would like a career switch to other areas in IT. The degree I get might not be able to allow me to jump to other areas in IT.

I feel I am not technically as strong as I do not have a programming background and I don't think I am a fast learner. If I take up the computer science course, would it tough for me to catch up. What should I do?

Furthermore, many of the jobs do not require expertise or knowledge pertaining to your degree. A recent news showed that half of Singapore grads find jobs not related to their degree. Goes to show how useless the core modules become when you graduate. Note to self: Memorize your notes, cause you can just forget it after finals.

Some may argue that you will learn soft skills, project management skills, get networks etc during your undergrad course. But you can also learn these while accumulating work experience, not to mention the salary which you can use to pamper and upgrade yourself.

Going to a JC used to be a popular choice for many of those who can. But as the gap between a diploma and bachelor cert closes (in terms of value for money from the perspective of a employer), will diploma be the new favourite? Or will fresh grads widen the gap by pursuing masters?

How am I even suppose to reach the stage of ""graduating and working with colleagues"" when I cannot even graduate because of slackers in the first place?

This ""you can't choose your colleagues"" or ""such is life"" reasoning has to stop. Let us focus on the short term goals of not paying the LD before even talking about choosing colleagues when we graduate please.

200,"I'd been fighting with my younger brother for half a year now, because of our disagreement over his university course. He applied once and did not get any offers back. I'm a recent Computing graduate, and due to our family's financial problems, I agreed to pay for the tuition fees of my younger siblings' university and polytechnic education. However, even though my brother did not do well for his A-levels and highly likely couldn't qualify for Biz or Engineering, much less CS, he decided to ""follow the trend"" to choose courses in CS in his application. He's interested in subjects such as algorithms, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, computer graphics, and cryptography from things like video games and cryptocurrencies!?

I advised him to choose a more realistic course option he could enter but he refused, saying it was either NUS SoC or NTU equivalent or private uni equivalent. I showed him statistics that IGP for SoC had rocketed, so it'll be hard for him to get in even if he attempts however many times he can during NS. At my wits' end, I threatened not to pay his uni fees if he went the private route and he rebutted me by saying he will work part-time to fund his own education.

What can I do to make him see the light? Why are those youngsters so focused on their own selfish aims? I'm just upset about it.

201,"Hi, 

*lengthy post ahead

I am currently a year 1 student in comp science (part-time) from a local uni. Just a rough background of myself, i came from an engineering diploma from poly, and am in my mid 20s.

Recently I have the thought of dropping out from the course and apply for an IT course in SUSS instead. Reason being: 1) it does not have maths/engineering related modules as compared to the local uni, modules were IT related. 2) local uni's workload is much more and fast-paced, bellcurve with full time students and I would say I'm generally not a fast learner. 

However the business IT course focuses on mainly a specific area of IT (The degree course is quite a niche area I guess) hence Is it advisable to go for it or would a comp science degree is better as it offers a wider range of job opportunities? Currently I do not know which area of IT I would like to dive into hence I chose Comp science degree so that it allows me to explore the various options while studying in uni. 

However recently as considering my age factor etc once I graduated from uni, would it be wiser if I take up the SUSS course instead as it allows me to build my experiences in it and also to allow myself to kinda just force to try ""grow"" interest in it?
As the modules in Comp science are quite general and by the time I graduated, I might not have the ""in-depth"" skills to allow me to build my experiences in the area I would like to dive in.

What should I do?

A: change course to the SUSS course immediately, which the sch will starts in Jan, or in July.
B: stick with current local uni course, in the meantime search job related to the suss course and work there to see if I enjoy that area of IT. (Bt this could means I will miss the Jan intake and would have to join the July intake).

Thanks all for reading!

Many arguments happened between us and at the start of this year, she asked for a breakup and i begged her to stay even though in between the rs, many ppl including my parents and disapprove our relationship simply because of mainly personality. We “got back tgt” but she lied behind me regarding her using tinder even though i showed her clear evidence that she did. Call me paranoid but i just wanted to find out the truth. In the end, we called it a day one month later. A few weeks after that, i used my workplace’s duty phone to text her pretending to be my friend demanding for my jacket, which she claimed that she alr posted it to my house. From then till now, which is about 8 months alr, i still havent got it back so pretty sure she still keeps it. I wonder why she still has my jacket even though after me, she dated 2 other guys and now she’s alr in a rs. Im afraid of what she will do to the jacket.

During my exchange, i am able to do a research project on it despite not having any formal education in it as i learn everything by myself. I am now seriously considering whether should i pursue a phd on it instead of my engineering degree but this will mean that i will end up jobless in Singapore should i come back. This means that i have to give up living in Singapore as the only jobs i can get will be overseas and i will have to compete with insanely smart people around the world which i may not be able to. So should i trade my engineering skills that come along with easy and comfortable life with something that i am passionate about but at the cost of highly competitive, difficultly, low guarantee of success and less than 6 hours sleep?

I can’t imagine myself pumping a XS one even if she’s what others consider to be perfect. However I have been forced to hide this from my circle of friends as they always ridicule XL girls. I end up calling these girls mean names in front of my friends to fit in, and it pains me deeply inside. To make things worse, when I’m around a girl I find attractive, I get so anxious. I can’t even look at her, and end up doing all kinds of stupid things and saying disrespectful stuff to her.

There’s one girl in particular. We are on the same pokemon go team, and she has this really cute face (a bit like whismur). My heart races so fast I feel like I’m getting a heart attack whenever I hear her voice (she’s pretty loud and expressive so you usually hear her before you see her). I think we’re really quite compatible, with similar playstyles in pokemon go. Furthermore, because of the game, I will get to see her quite frequently. But alas, I’ve blew it yet again by always being overly mean to her such that I believe she despises me.

Been browsing on Instagram, sometimes I see Instagram Story advertisements. Things like careers in financial advisory, setting up an e-commerce shop, and other stuff, but those are not what I want to ask about. 

What I want to ask about are overseas internships. I have seen story advertisements from Absolute Internship and Capital Placement which talk about overseas internships in places like the UK, Spain, and other places not Singapore(though SG is a location). Looks good on paper: Work overseas and experience life as a pseudo-local there for three to six months. Might be a good resume bulding activity. Sure, it will not be fun and games like SEP, but it might be a stepping stone to either a full-time opportunity at the SG branch if no desire to work overseas and if they have one, or a possible ticket to a long term working pass overseas.

Just a few months back when I was given a new project, there was this drop-dead gorgeous guy who came into our office for a meeting. He looked so handsome I was swooning as I made him a coffee. Our meeting turned to lunch and when we finished up I told him, “Ring me any time if I can help you with anything.”

One night he called to ask me something trivial but then he said, “Look, I’m sorry to call you so late but in all honesty, I couldn’t stop thinking about you.”
I cut the call short as my boyfriend was at home with me but the next morning I called him and we arranged to have lunch in a hotel.

We ended up having sex in a hotel room after lunch and the it was so amazing! 
His body was ripped and he really appreciated what I had to offer.
We’ve been meeting up for sex for months now and we even did it in the back of his car before.

My bf will always take the initiative to go make payment/settle the bill, be it for meals, movies tickets, activities on their travels etc. And if you’re wondering whether it’s because my bf is richer or earn more, nope they make about the same.  I earn way less than my bf and his relatives yet I offer to pay half the time and he lets me but doesn’t let them. His relatives are just really thick skinned. I have tried talking to my bf about it but he gets very defensive because his relatives are his priority and he’s totally willing. Perhaps it’s not my place to say who he should or shouldn’t pay for cos afterall I’m an “outsider”. But I fear that such habits will go on after we get married. To make things worse, they hang out very often, about a few times a week so he squanders a lot of money on them each week. I find it hard to accept a husband who squanders away hard earned money on his able bodied relatives with equal earning capability in the long term.

Girls are always craving food, thinking of food, and finding new cafes to try. Girls always say they love to eat! But when they do eat, they say their appetite is small, and ask males to help finish because males supposedly have bigger appetites? 

But males, whose stomachs can finish so much food, don’t “love” food! They don’t care about what they eat, they are not enthusiastic about trying new food, and they don’t even go dessert shops to share cake! 

If men can eat so much, why don’t they say they love food? shouldn’t they be the ones always eating candy, chocolate, cake, and ice cream all the time?

Girls always say they love food and have cravings, yet they are the ones who say “but girl cannot eat much what”.

My gf totally respects my choice not to convert, and we've both mutually agreed on the possibility of us not working out. 
So we've sort of agreed to be friends, not in a R/s. Also she's not those ""religious"" kind of muslim, which just puts in the grey area because there's a chance of us working out, albeit small.

Is it that bad/wrong to be seeing someone of a different race/religion? It's just sad that people still think this way. I'm at a loss because i dont even know if it's ME at fault here, or just my parents' preconception about interfaith-racial relationships. I don't want to be burning bridges over something like this.

Also since we've agreed on remaining as friends, is going out with someone of the opposite gender from time to time REALLY that unbelievable? My parents are going ape shit whenever i inform them we're going to see a movie/have a meal. They think we're still dating and that my surname's gonna get changed.

No, lying isn't an option. I just wanna know how to get them to understand and see things from my perspective; that religion/race doesn't matter to ME even if it does to them. Am i being selfish? Am i in the wrong for even wanting to TRY to continue this R/S despite their disapproval?

I have been together with my bf since poly, and we have both grad from uni and are working now. I can say he is generous and sweet towards me — pays for meals, goes the extra mile to show interest in my hobbies (even when I can tell he’s not too keen haha), etc. Overall, it looks like there’s nothing to complain about, and there is the kind of stability you mention in some of your relationship advice. However, there are some times (like, almost predictably every 4-6 months) when he walks out on me whenever we have a minor argument, or if i say something that accidentally triggers him (even though i don’t think it is really offensive, just being honest with what I think). On top of making me feel bad (but I’m slowly getting more numb to it lately), I think these walk-outs are quite immature. If I try to have a mature conversation about this, he will continue to stonewall me or change the topic.I can tell that he is uncomfortable (rather than intentionally trying to hurt me), so I have been dropping it. My feeling is that he walks out due to his inability/too tired to deal with the situation.  I am not sure if these incidents are worth tolerating in a long-term relationship, especially since it seems that they can be predictable. Would like to seek your insight and advice for my situation!

Often, I'm the one starting the conversation and he will reply enthusiastically and sometimes the conversation can last for over an hour. However, he never initiates text at all. I've tried not texting him for a day or two but he has never even once initiated text. I'm pretty confused. He's a very private person and keeps a lot of things to himself. He's going through a hard time due to something that happened. He would tell me some of his thoughts and stuff and he calls it ""ranting"". Am I just a trustworthy friend to him? Or is there actually chance between us?

P.S. We don't see each other often. And he has never ask me out too.

245,"Hi Prof Ben, 
This is entirely unrelated to cs but I’m a physics major who has no idea what in the world I’m doing here. I chose physics cos in JC, I somehow ended up doing physics Olympiad, and those questions from then were really hard and I happen to quite enjoy challenges. 
So fast forward few years, I’m now majoring in physics, and I quite enjoy what I do now. Most exams are pretty fun, and following the proofs from lecture notes etc keeps me entertained. But, I’m a downright awful experimentalist, and I don’t feel like I have any real interest in physics.(my classmates get excited about black holes and quantum tech and whatnot, but I honestly don’t care)
So, I’m still in year 2, with quite a while till I graduate, but I think my life is going in a wrong direction. I don’t think real physics suits me. Am I wrong? Could I get some advise on what to do going forward? Thanks!

247,"I've been dating this girl for 3 years now. We've had insane sex in every single imaginable position, style or way during those first few months, up to ten times a day.

I really like this girl. But recently, the sex has become painfully boring to me. I used to enjoy it quite a lot, I very much looked forward to it, but now, it's become a routine I don't particularly enjoy. I find myself rather playing video games than having sex, which is very, very weird to me, as I'm the type of guy that would travel 2 hours for fifteen minutes of sex anytime. This is my first long relationship, and I'm unsure whether something like this is even normal - she literally needs to be laying on top of me, naked, for me to even get aroused. I used to pop boners just by looking at her.

I don't want to break up with her, but sex plays an important role in my life 

So the question is, what should I do to bring that old spice back? Any ideas, tips, suggestions? I don't want to pursue another relationship, nor do I want to risk this girl by cheating on her (although that would definitely solve the sex issue).

TL;DR, My Girlfriend doesn't attract me sexually anymore, but I really, really like being with her. What can I do to bring the old spice back?

248,"Capitalism, materialism and social media are making it ever more difficult to develop meaningful relationships. I feel like everyone only talks to you because they want something from you. If you are pretty, they talk to you because they want to date you and look desirable. If you are smart, they want your help with work. If you are rich, they want free stuff. People are always out to take advantage of others because that's how you survive in this capitalist society. Our economy is built on the principles of selfishness. Social media is only making things worse. It is another way for people to look cool, build their brand and pretend that their life is perfect. I think these issues are exacerbated in Singapore because we care so much about ""face"". I'm so sick of people who only care about how others think of them.

249,"I graduated some years back from NUS with a computing degree. Unlike my peers, instead of settling for a typical IT career, I devoted myself full time into an MLM that I had been involved in since my university days. The MLM, of Middle Eastern origins, is in the business of providing motivational and life coaching to participants. Participants were highly encouraged to give back to the MLM for the benefit of themselves and others. With my fellow directors' efforts, we grew the MLM to be one of the largest in Singapore and the region. The revenue grew to a level that my family and I could afford to move into Sentosa Cove.

However, even though all seems smooth sailing, there are problems unknown to others. Chief of which is my wife, or rather her dream. She loves singing and always harboured the dream to have an album of her own. Our MLM is also exploring using music to spread our motivational and life coaching messages to even more people. Getting her to front this project would be a nice fit. Yet, I feel uncomfortable that in a way, the MLM is sponsoring my wife's personal dream. I am also disturbed when preliminary talks with some music producers involved musical concepts on Chinese alcohol which may not be a good fit for our wholesome motivational and life coaching corporate messaging.

What should I do? Should I choose to fulfil my wife's dream with the MLM's financial backing or to let a neutral third party decide for the greater good of the MLM?

Yes, I'm aware that there have been some injuries as a result of pedestrians jaywalking across walkways without even bothering to check their surroundings.

If I wanted to do sales, I'd rather sell something which I know what I am talking about, and at least it is an actual product that has utility to the buyer. Best case is when a buyer already knows what they want, all that is required is to tell them where it is placed. Not harass acquaintences on  ̶s̶o̶s̶h̶e̶r̶ social media and cold calling in a bid to grow  ̶d̶o̶w̶n̶l̶i̶n̶e̶s̶ legs while doing the same for an upline.

Yes, retail can be one long chain from the manufacturer to the importer/distributor to the reseller to the consumer, with each stage adding more to the cost the consumer pays. Of course there are things like import taxes and customs along with the guarantee of warranty, so maybe some real value is being added along the line in terms of product support and bringing the item to somewhere the consumer can obtain it. Case in point, there was a posting that almost thought Prof Ben ran a logistics company. That is actually the local distributor of some electronics you might be using, but you might not be able to get direct from them. Money comes in from outside the manufacturer, product(without artificial demand from inside the company) transfers to the consumer on the outside. There might be some backdoor deals going on in terms of that logistics chain, but be it Challenger or a shop in Sim Lim Square, the general idea is there.There are also online channels now, so no hard selling from store staff.

TLDR: Avoid MLMs like the plague, if want to do sales, work for reputable stores and/or brands.

267,"I am the OP of #68663, responding to the comments suggesting that the CMB profiles I was referring to are fake. One Xu S Han, for instance, claimed that “CMB uses fake profiles to con carrots like you”. 

While I think there is some force in the claim that the profiles I had referred to in my earlier post are fake, I thought I should just highlight a couple of indicators that point strongly against that.

First, my friends and I had, in the past, matched with some of these bagels. These bagels in fact responded to our messages, at least in the first two days. They also typed in a colloquial, local manner. However, it usually became quickly obvious from their responses that they were not interested. 

Second, these bagels have, over time, updated their profiles, whether it be job title, descriptions, new photos and even the order of their photos. I am generally quite observant, and can remember these little details very easily.

Third, as some of these bagels are actually friends of my friends, I have incidentally chanced upon a few of their Facebook profiles (from group pictures and Facebook posts). Interestingly, the photos used in their CMB profiles are completely different from those they had uploaded on Facebook. Obviously, CMB could not have magically created these photos out of nowhere. They were not photoshopped. 

Fourth, and as absurd as this sounds, I think this is one of those situations where it is apt to use the phrase “you know it when you see it”. Feel free to disagree, but I think those of us who have used CMB will get my drift. 

Needless to say, I’m not suggesting that these permanent residents of CMB are doing anything wrong. Rather, the behaviour of these bagels is merely a reflection of a social phenomenon that has arisen with the advent of online dating (read my earlier post). 

On a final note, apart from the points raised in my earlier post, I think it is safe to say that for most of us using CMB, it becomes increasingly easy over time to sieve the chaff from the wheat.

268,"I (M) started using CMB again recently, two years after I deleted my account. 

Out of curiosity, I scrolled through the profiles of the female bagels in the Discover section, with the option “Active within the last 72 hours” selected. 

Interestingly, I spotted many familiar-looking bagels who I had “liked” previously, two to three years ago. Most of them are at least a 7/10.

Initially, I thought that these girls might perhaps, like me, have returned to CMB (for various reasons) after staying away from it for a while. However, this notion quickly proved to be wrong when I started seeing more and more familiar faces.

To be sure, I showed some of the profiles to a few friends of mine who are active CMB users (more so than I am). My friends unanimously agreed that they had seen these same profiles for an extended period of time.

I cannot help but wonder why so many pleasant-looking girls have continued using CMB for such a long time. 

Is CMB really bereft of decent chaps, so much so that this has left them to become permanent CMB residents? Or are people just overly caught up in the illusion of “choice”, to the extent that they end up spending so much time men searching for the elusive “one”.

In any event, as someone who’s using CMB to find something serious, I know what to do when these familiar-looking profiles appear as suggested matches.

277,"I feel like writing this down because I’ve seen too much information exchange going on between the students and the teachers on whispers about the fundamental programming modules. As a student who is at the end of the streamline and is about to become a finished product pushed to the job market, the posts reminded me of how I survived my first year of university here. And my reflection saddens me, not just because it is about a painful year, but more for a pre-mature me undergoing so much torture. Well, the torture indeed made me tougher and stronger (what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger lol), but I would appreciate it more if I was given more understanding and encouragement when I was deep in my struggle.

I remember the first lecture of my fundamental programming module gave me a blow right in my head. I just couldn’t get it when I heard “recursion/iteration is like induction, you just assume it works in the previous step, and it will work in the next step”. I became even more panicky when during the lesson right after the lecture, everyone else there seemed to know how to use recursion/iteration to solve the problems, as if their brains are dry sponges absorbing the knowledge instantaneously. I was so stunned when they solved the questions on the board with the things taught less than one hour ago, and even more stunned when there were people solving the questions using untaught techniques – for loops and while loops (these were some big wow to me because I never heard of them before…)! I just couldn’t understand how they got their solutions, or rather, why they are so freaking smart. I guess I looked too stunned. After a star student presented his answer, the teacher walked over, and asked me a question that I could finally understand. “You don’t understand anything, do you?” And with this question my stunned face was exposed to everyone in the room. Well, I really don’t understand anything, so I said, “no I don’t”. The teacher turned, and walked back to the board, “it’s ok, we are here to help you”. And there went more questions, and there went my totally shutdown brain.

That lesson ended at 3pm, and I went back home, sat down at my desk, and tried to figure out what the hell is recursion/iteration. It took me 10 hours to figure it out, and I remember the number of hours spent so clearly simply because I only left my chair at 1am with numb legs and a drained yet excited brain. It was really just what was taught, “recursion/iteration is like induction, you just assume it works in the previous step, and it will work in the next step”, but it took me 10 hours straight of thinking to absorb it. Now whenever I think of this experience, I am always so thankful that I figured it out just in time. I have seen people who didn’t try so hard and were left behind. I am thankful that it got the grit out of me, which would be necessary for me to survive the rest of my years in the university. But my practice is highly questionable, or rather, the motivation of my practice is highly questionable. What gave me the strength to think for 10 hours straight without eating, drinking or moving around? And why did I ask for help from my friends, when they seemed to understand the concept? I would say it was because of shame. I was afraid that people would say “it’s so easy, why don’t you just get it?” I was afraid to let other people know that I have become so “illiterate” and “dumb” when I used to be a top tier student. And I was afraid to get that question again, “you don’t understand anything, do you?”

And my shame was dismantled at the next lesson. The teacher gave us a question on the spot. He walked over to my desk (again), bent down, examined my solution, and then copied it to the board, “uhmmm, this looks pretty pedestrian.” I was stunned (again), because I didn’t know how to interpret the word “pedestrian”. Is it something like “路人甲” in Chinese (it means mundane and insignificant), or something else? And while I was thinking of the meaning of the word, a few of his favorite star students presented their solutions, “innovative”, as he branded them, but upon further scrutiny, failed. The teacher examined my solution on board again, “uhmmmm, seems like only the pedestrian way works.” I really felt like leaving the room at that instant. And that was the last time I appeared at his lesson. I thought, there is nothing to be shameful about. “Pedestrian” doesn’t mean I can’t win. I worked hard, I thought hard, and I got it right. If someone, especially an authority, brands me as “pedestrian”, gives me no faith from the start, the shame is not on me. 

The end of the story is not a fantastic one. I got B+ for this mod, and I had to S/U it. But does the B+ make me a less adequate programmer than a student who got A for this mod? No, as far as I can see, no. This mod is just about the fundamentals, the basics, the easiest things, of programming, and one day, it will become your second nature, just as easy as you speak and think in English. When I revised the material at the start at the next semester, I marveled at how stupid I was, why the hell did I spend 10 hours straight trying to figure out recursion, when it is just an induction??? But at the same time, I could still feel the pain of struggling and the fire of shame and anger that was burning inside me during those 10 hours. During these days when learning becomes a lot easier for me, I started reflecting on this experience. The most painful part for me of that mod was not the 30+ coding assignments, but the lack of faith in me, both by myself and by the teacher (at least that was how I felt). My confidence was shattered during that mod, and I tried so hard just to prove to whoever that I thought scorned upon me and gave up on me (well, myself included), that I can do it. I have to say it worked as a motivation, after all it got me learn how to work my ass off, but was it necessary for it to be so passive? Did I learn just for a proof of my capabilities, or for my future development, or for my interest, my passion? Does learning, especially for something that should be as easy as a second nature, have to be so painful? Would it be better if I had the courage to use more resources e.g. teachers friends families google etc.? Would I learn better if I didn’t get so angry to push myself to the dead-ends? 

There are so many what-ifs, but there is only one time that I undergo this process, and it shapes me to who I am now. I am thankful to this experience, but whenever I recall it, I really want to give a hug to the a-few-year-ago me, and let her know that things shouldn’t be so difficult, if it is, you are learning it the wrong way.

Does anyone feel this weird pressure to specialize in AI/ML for their focus area? I know a good proportion of students are deciding to specialize in AI but I'm wondering how well does this reflect the actual job climate?

Software engineering is my current focus area and I find it really interesting but admittedly, I do feel it is kind of bland compared to AI.

If anyone could share their insight that would be greatly appreciated!

My question is, which areas (e.g. data science, IOT, machine learning) should I do if I have a passion for and am good in math? 

Thank u!!!

294,"I feel like my Uni life is pretty boring. I just go to sch for 3 days per week (classes are boring too) and the rest of the week I would have to find stuff to do to kill time. I would either be studying in the library, going to the gym, catching up with friends or doing some part time work occasionally. I do like playing video games but I would feel guilty for wasting time if I play for too Long. Recently I have tried to self learn some things like coding or cooking to kill time too. 

Just feel that life is kinda mundane and Its like I’m wasting everyday away. I’m not really enjoying my life everyday. My gf is probably the only thing that makes me happy now, though it’s LDR. Any suggestions?

295,"Dear Prof Ben, I am working full time and I am taking a part time  masters in NUS computing. I would like to understand why there are no web casts for the classes... I understand that taking a masters is an commitment and I should be willing to make the effort to attend classes. However, as working adults, there will be days that we cant make it to classes... The 2 to 3 hours we spent travelling could very well be used to listen/understand the web cast and get starting on the projects and assignments. Isn't it kind of ironic and that masters in a technology related course is not making use of technology to make our lives better? :(

296,"I've been with my bf for 2 years now, and only recently we have tried to erhem erhem. He used to say he wasn't ready for it, but I found it strange as he would usually pleasure me with his fingers. Well, let's just say stayovers would end with me being naked but him being fully dressed.

Two week ago, after a night out at a pub, we tried to do it at his hostel and he revealed his reason for abstaining. His little brother is no longer than a USB stick. Of course I said it was no issue, but after an awkward 10 minutes of attempting to make it happen, he broke down and started crying. He said his exgf left him for this exact reason and he feels guilty for not telling me earlier on, and started begging me not to leave him. I reassured him that it's really not an issue, as I truly felt that sex wasn't all that important.

But after returning home the next day, thoughts started running through my mind. I'm still a virgin, and will probably remain as one if I marry him in the future. How weird are things now? Well, yesterday, we saw the kukujiao cheer from ntu while browsing on facebook and I could see him feeling uneasy already... 

Tbh I'm selfish, and I really think I'll be missing out too much if I stay with him how can I break up with him without him knowing the true reason?

299,"Prof Ben or anyone pls advice!
Its complicated. Love is like a triangle but an opened one. A girl likes me but i like another girl, however the girl i like is an INFJ and she's really nice to everyone, so i cant tell if she likes me. I dont think she does though, because we hardly have much interaction due to us taking different mods despite being in the same course. I talked to her once while going home and it feels like we're friends (after all we havent really talked one on one much, we mostly just say hi when we see each other around school)

I like her so much that it hurts to think about it and i dont think i can like anyone else. Truly, i feel bad for the girl who likes me, because i know if i hadn't met the 2nd girl, i would have accepted the 1st, we connect well and interact much more than me with the 2nd. But i cant stop thinking about the 2nd girl. The 2nd girl seems too busy with studies to bother about relationships

Both girls are the shy and independent kind and the first girl looks better than the 2nd. But im more attracted to the 2nd girl because of her intellect and personality, she's soft spoken, helpful and really smart. She's from one of the top 2 JCs and currently a first class honor student and does well at everything she does, also she does many things alone, although i seen her once or twice with a grp of people. In many ways we're alike, but i think she just sees me as a friend :( also im too shy to ask her or anything at the moment since we're not even close. 

I need help either
1. Forgetting the 2nd girl
2. Finding out if the 2nd girl likes me

Not that gender matters, but im a girl too

301,"Dear Prof Ben,

My friend threw me this question so now i will like to forward his question to you instead.

My friend and i were both from the same JC. However, he didnt do well enough in A levels to secure a place in local uni. Therefore, he took the unconventional path of going back to poly after NS due to financial constraints.Back then, his aim was to just make it into a local uni.

Fast forward 2 years later, he is now on his final year internship before he graduates. With his current grades, he can easily get in to a lot of courses in any local uni.

However, he is already 24. He thinks that by going to uni for another 3-4 years, he will be lacking the working experience to apply for a job. Also, applying for a job at the age of 28-29 years old with no relevant full time working experience may also put him at a disadvantage as compared to others.

So Prof Ben, with your experience in life so far, do you think my friend should just apply for a job once he comes out of poly, or should he go forward with his education in a local uni if he has a chance to?

305,"Dear Prof Ben, 

May I ask what does it take to be selected for valedictorian?

I know this is an awkward question, but please don't get me wrong, I'm not asking just to paper chase my way to becoming a valedictorian, I'm just a freshman trying to find my way in life. I find uni can be confusing - many people have many different views and goals for their uni life. I just want a fresh start, to start my uni life on the right foot. I want to set my goals right and work hard towards them. But before I can, I think it would be helpful to know what to work towards also. 

I sense that you're a prof who has a wealth of life experience and who is willing to help students, thought perhaps it will be a good idea to ask you.

I figured perhaps by asking this question I could get a sense of what qualities an ""ideal person"" should have. 

If it's not possible to share the exact selection criteria for valedictorian here, could you perhaps share your views on what you would advise a student to develop in terms of (soft) skills, character, attributes that could help them go far in life? What advice would you give to a freshman just entering university?

308,"For those who read my confession #68039, I thanked you for your commentaries on it. No matter what it is, I am still myself and nothing is changed except for my feelings. If anyone were disgusted with the story, I apologized for sharing such an uncomfortable and shocking story to you. 

I know that it was ended up with a very bad condition where I didn’t even talk to him at all. And I don’t know whether he is bi or what, but to be honest, there is no such friend would do extra miles like the normal couple did. But in the end, he never admit it to me at all.

Sometimes, the feeling of guilt dominates my thought where I am always feel that I disturb his time and breaching his space despite he is the one did it most of the time after the confession. But truthfully, there is no single anguish came out from him except for copious cursatives he said unto me which is normal to me.

I love being together with him and I don’t need him to do alot of extra miles for me, just being himself present in front of me should be enough. But now, his presence makes me more angry even though he was not in the same dept as mine since I transferred out, because for all the things that he did to me which was ended up so badly. 

Perhaps there is abit of anguish came out from my own self due to all the things that happened between us, but my love for him never fade. That is the one last thing I told him before I transferred out from my old dept, I told him that I loved him. I walked away with a heavy feelings, looking at his glistening eyes that tells his own unspeakable mixed reaction. He knows that I loved him and he did loved me but only as a good friend (or perhaps, he didn’t want to admit it to me).

I don’t know whether you will read this or not, but I hope you are okay outside there. Please take care of yourself and hope you are always be happy. I still love you and perhaps in few years again once you got married, that will be the time I will stop loving you. I am not putting any hopes on you again but I just want you to be happy for who you are now. 

I also wanted to ask Prof Ben on how to cope myself from these matter. I just realised that I am bisexual and I felt confused whether it is against social norms when it comes to love one another. It has been hard for me even the closure done which was failed miserably.
