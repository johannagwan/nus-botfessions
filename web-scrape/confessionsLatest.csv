2,"Someone, that I have good feelings for, just confessed to me. It came as a shock to me and I’m very confused right now. 

He is a really nice guy. He is nice to the girls all around him and always watching out for me. I didn’t really give much thought about it when he was nice to me, because I always thought he treated me well because he retarded me as a xiaomeimei. He takes care of the people around him very well. Even though my friends always tease him about me (when I’m not around), he always say no. There were also many times he said he is not ready for a relationship at this stage, he hasn’t gotten about his ex, and he is just figuring out his life right now. 

From my understanding of his personality, i’m just afraid that he mixed up his care and concern for me as a xmm for romantic feelings. 

I understand that he has been through a few bad relationships, and I do as well. Both of us are looking for a good and nice partner. And I really wish I could sort this out with him. I think it’s only fair, for him and me, to know each other feelings. 

How should I raise this up to him? I feel like both of us are really not ready for this. The guy, being the kind and nice guy, would definitely deny it. I don’t know what to do.

But for the past few days, all of the sudden I had flashbacks of the time when we were together and I can't seem to focus with my daily tasks and spent time thinking about it ..

Lately when I was eating alone at canteen, one team mate saw me and he decided to join my table and we ate together. (Im a girl and Im sure he is not interested in me since he forgotten we had lunch together the next time we chatted).

That was when I realized the joy of having someone to have meal with. These days when I see people sitting alone playing phone, I really have the urge to join the table and strike a conversation but I worry that people (especially guys) may think I have other intention...

5,"hello, I’ve never really felt the need to express my feelings on a platform like this but recently I’ve felt like it’s gotten worse and I can’t bear them anymore.

I’ve been always an optimistic kid and would try to help others as much as I can. However, during my secondary/poly school years, I got bullied by a group of girls and because they were considered popular, many guys who were friends with them had the same feelings towards me as well, this would eventually escalate and lead to my inability to even utter a word to the opposite sex or anyone who seemed remotely popular. I became a shell of who I used to be, and omitted myself from as many activities as possible. I hated the times where Teachers told us to choose our teams as I knew I would be a leftover. This shattered my self confidence and esteem, and I withdrew even further inwards. The breaking point came when I overheard a ghastly untrue rumor spread by one of my bullies few years after the apparent initial rumor started. At that point, I literally felt everything keeping me afloat disintegrate. How has it been so many years and why has such a ridiculous rumor even last till now.
By then, I refrained my actions and words to anyone, and kept to a minimum.

Since then, I’ve made it into university, I would never have thought I got this far. I still remain as quiet, and dislike speaking in public. I do not use social media to interact with classmates etc. 
Recently, I did a group project and I could not get along with my team members due to differences in goal-setting and standards of academic writing. Which was why when the time came for another project, I became another leftover. Although it may have been my fault for not being able to comply with my members work, I did pull more than my own weight in the project and did a huge percentage of the work.

I feel really disheartened and have been contemplating suicide for a long time now. I know it’s my fault that I’m this way, but I hope people understand that my circumstances have conditioned me to become this way. I came into Uni, hoping I could start afresh, but I feel like complete and utter sh*t, for lack of a better word. 

People have told me to change myself, but it’s easier said than done. I really don’t know what to do. I don’t know how I’m going to continue on.

9,"I just need a space to rant and speak my mind. Currently in a long term relationship, and as things progress, my gf and I have been talking about our future arrangements/agreements. When it comes to money, she controls everything that I earn. Everything I do have to go through her too. Whenever I have a differing opinion to her, she gets extremely upset. She can’t understand my point of view when it comes from me, however she’ll be more understanding when she speaks to her friends about it.  She does have valid reasons for everything, and I can understand her point of view. But I am just not comfortable with losing control of everything that I do. We are both on equal footing in our jobs, and I’m starting to lose sight on why it’s worth sacrificing everything I find important to me to be with her. I have and am willing to compromise on things that are important to me as I know a relationship takes two to make it work. But to what extent? She’s always there for me, as I am for her. I support everything she does and everything she wants. I’ll rarely say no as I want her to be happy. But it’s always a no when it comes to me on issues she disagrees. When I do disagree with her, she gets upset but does  have reasonable reasons for it. But I just want to do something that I want to sometimes. It’s not something big like buying an extra house or car etc either.  I am beginning to just agree with her to prevent any further arguments.

Even all of my guy friends told me that they were apprehensive to approach me before they known me yet. Those girls who I tried to initiate convo with mostly find some excuses to end the convo quickly or show some uncomfortable look. I also come from a low income background and could not afford to buy good looking clothes and groom myself. The only thing I can offer a girl is perhaps honesty and sincerity as that is always how I have treated all my friendships. The problem is that with all the girls scared off by my looks, how can I ever think of getting one to know each other better?

11,"What are some of the ways to maximise my income without OT? I have been working for close 8 months, and currently have the following profile. 

1) I deposit as much as I can from a part of my salary in standard chartered 's jump-start account. Have about $7k inside right now. 

2) just  started using stashaway and looking at investing at ETF, corporate bonds etc, giving a projected income of 3.75% per Annum. 
Besides this, I also have the cash management portion offered by stashaway called StashAway Simple ,which offers me 1.9% per annum interest. 

The reason why I am looking forward to diversify and earn more money is not only for personal use(travelling with my friends to overseas, getting braces for myself, driving lesson etc), but I really want to be ahead of my peers. I realise that financial literacy is something not a lot of people around the 20s will have, and if I gain a bit of extra info and can use if to share with my friends, I guess they will be happy to get out of the rat race here in Singapore. Work life had been rough, and I hope that things are getting better for me at least.

12,"I am writing this because I have no idea how to tell it to you in person. Perhaps you might just skim thru this post and if so, so be it. 

I confessed to you last year and you rejected and the ensuing awkwardness started to kill our friendship. I assured you that everything was okay but it's quite obvious that our friendship is dying. We stopped voicecalling on discord and we rarely chatted except on a few rare occasions. I was at least glad to see that you were enjoying yourself but internally I was agonising deeply because I couldn't spend time with you. You promised to go to the arcade during the holidays and even watch a few movies but the promises were unkept. I was devastated because each day I looked forward to you inviting me out which never happened. Perhaps I wasn't as important a friend that I thought I was to you. I couldn't tell you these because it's just my anxiety and I shouldn't trouble you with these. 

Recently you asked why I was being weird towards you. I like you and I know that I can never be with you. I have no idea what to do in this situation. Every moves I make feel like a losing one. Maybe all these are just another case of me overthinking. I just don't know what to do.

18,"To be honest, it feels like I have come so far till the point now in NUS. Meaning I just feel like I am not as ""pure"" as before, and I have the tendency of wanting people to change perceptions of me.

Just a background of myself. I used to study overseas during my nursery and kindergarten, where English was not my first language. Only since primary school, I have always been studying in Singapore. As I was mostly home during those periods where my parents were working day in day out, I had never really socialise with other children. I did not even know how to communicate with them and not even knowing how to make friends. 

This got worse in primary school where i suffered bullying for about 3 years, where i had the naive thinking that if I was nice to anybody regardless bullies or not, they will appreciate me one day. But no, this never happened and school had been hell for me. They even criticised my looks and me being ""weird"". My mum found out one day that i was bullied and told me to be harsh if need be. I totally changed my attitude towards people, changed my looks by dressing more appropriately and etc and even focusing on building close connections. Of course in between I had experienced some ups and downs during my connection with people, such as betrayals and even those with toxic mentality. 

Thus I feel like I have changed in terms of how i interact with people. This is good for me personally as I have more people to communicate with and etc. But what I have noticed is, based on my past experience of making such connections, I just cannot help but have the tendency to always change myself(such as looks, personality and etc) as compared to how people usually view me. For example my secondary school friend had the thinking initially that I was always very quiet, not dressing up. But now in the same uni, she saw me and commented that I look and act totally different of how she viewed me initially. Even towards the bullies in the past, I kept making sure I look better and do much better than them even though i tried my best not to bother about them. However after meeting them, I then focus on how to make myself even better than before and change their perceptions for the better. In short, I seem to bother more about people's opinions and impressions of me, when I am trying my best to love myself by just being myself. Instead it feels quite pressurising at times having these tendencies. Sighs...

I heard that and it was like a stab in the wound tbh, back then i really hated how i look and would stare in the mirror scratching my face trying to peel it off  or at least hope for a miracle to look decent. Fast forward to poly life i started wearing makeup and dress provocatively to make myself look at least average but suddenly i was labeled as ""hot"" or ""cute"" and it was really nice to hear those compliments tbh. i started having my first bf and 7 more exes which instanly boost my self esteem up and i was more confident in admitting that i was goodlooking however i was never arrogant about it and i would often compliement how people look too. It was nice for a while until i met my recent friends who are a group of guys they are judgemental and mean and would often judge girls if they are goodlooking or not and thats basically what i see most guys do as well. It made me really upset when they say stuff like "" ur bf has a low libido because his with u"" or "" my ex was cute unlike (my name)"" ik its just their opinon but im really sensitive to how people comment on my looks and its killing me to know im back to how unattractive i was again.

Just when I was about to start my love life, you contacted me. You were depressed and you needed me. I chose you without much hesitation, I just couldn't bear to leave you in that state. 
Perhaps, it was the cultural differences or my lack-of experience, I struggled to adapt. But I loved you more than anything else, including myself, I followed my instinct and did whatever I could to make you happy.

I knew it was a toxic relationship , but I ignored all the red flags and dove right into it. I forgave all your wrongdoings, I would make sure to sleep later than you, I would buy anything for you. I spent all my savings to maintain the relationship just because I couldn't bear to see you sad or upset. You were my everything. 

You never cared about my feelings, my happiness or my well-being.  The relationship was simply two person in love with one person. We had plans for marriage, but I knew I couldn't tolerate this for the rest of my life. I wanted you to change, but you just couldn't change. I wanted out.

After the break up, you used various ways to make me stay. I stayed, but you couldn't stand the changes. We broke up again. I knew a leopard would never change its spot. After the 3rd break-up I blocked you on every social media platform, it was only way for you to move on.

30,"To confession #75084, 

I was bullied in Primary school. But I could not rmb what happened. I had suppressed part of my memory. Till now, I often have weird dreams about what actually happened.

I was bullied in secondary school. I was cyberbullied by my cca friend. And because of this, I became a weird person. I hate people approaching me. I hated myself and I tortured myself. I felt that no one really understand how I feel. I got really scared to make friends with people. Some of classmates made friend with me, but after telling them a small little secret which isn’t even true, they just spread hurtful words around in school. And because of that, I was famous in school and everyone hated me. I felt that I became a loner myself. I got very affected in my studies that I could not concentrate easily. 

When I went to ite, my senior that was in the same secondary school as me, spread gossips about me in class. Ended up everyone hated me and I became a loner myself. In my second yr, my sec sch senior even said a gossip about me right in front of me. I hated her. I wanted to give her a tight slap. And I have one sentence for her: YOU HATE ME, I HATE YOU TOO!! 

Now in poly, no one in the class seems to be willing to make friends with me. I am always quiet in class. And it seems very difficult for me to step out of my comfort zone. Cos the moment I step out, everyone starts judging me. Nevertheless, I am not gonna step out of my zone. Wish me all the best. A lot of people told me I need to step out of my comfort zone some day. But, I refused to. I only want to say: what’s the point of stepping out of my zone when everyone like to judge me about what I do? CANT YOU JUST LOOK AT YOURSELF AND JUDGE YOURSELF BEFORE YOU EVEN GIVE THE HECK TO JUDGE OTHERS? I KNOW IM A LONER, BUT WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU CAN JUDGE ME AND GOSSIP ABOUT ME AS AND WHEN YOU WANT?

31,"To #75073. Offering a guy's perspective to your 6 years relationship.

You said you weren't the best looking while your partner is, while you turned from secure to insecure in the relationship. Seems to me that a likely reason your bf fell for you was because of your personality, likely because he was attracted to how confident and secure you were at the time.

Now if you can't trust him and am insecure all the time, I think this is going to push him away from you. Seems to me he takes the effort to explain to you what those girls are texting him, this is not something every guy would bother to do to their girlfriend. And an active step from his part to build trust.

He can't change his looks, and any person who wants to cheat will cheat- this isn't a looks matter. Imo you have to work on your insecurities, if not it is you yourself who will ultimately be ending the relationship anyway- through your very own actions.

33,"As someone who graduated from university some years back, I can't stress enough the importance of having a good mentor. I wasn't from NUS, but my mentor was. You see, my mentor was the longtime CEO of the company I work in and he was a Jack Welch-type figure here. Suffice to say, many of our company's businesses were built up by him.

I was not his original protege. It was another person. Let's name him X. X was originally the COO to my mentor and was slated to take over when my mentor retires. However, X was caught dabbling in some backdoor transaction. My mentor then ousted X and made me his heir-apparent. After some time, my mentor retired and I took over as CEO. My time finally came, or so I thought.

Not long after I took over as CEO, X managed to return to the board of directors by convincing some shareholders to support him. However, I once again found X dabbling in yet another backdoor transaction, so I ousted him from the company again. I also tried to form some joint ventures with our smaller but more nimble competitor for synergies and got a foreign conglomerate to invest in our company. This must have incensed my mentor for he hated our smaller competitor. I am unsure how it happened but some company money somehow landed in my personal bank account. You don't look at the gift horse in the mouth, so I decided to spend the money to pamper my wife instead of on myself.

On the pretext that I somehow lined my pockets with company money, my mentor is now conspiring with X to oust me at the next shareholders' meeting. My wife is also not helping as she keeps wanting to advise me and repeatedly emphasises that I am the CEO with the power to snuff out this conspiracy asap. It's vexing and I now regret having treated my mentor with gratitude. To all you young ones, please open your eyes wide and clear when following someone as a mentor.

At first I thought he was perfect for me, our values and future goals aligned well, and we have similar things we liked to do as well, which made it easy to talk and hang out. But the more we are together, the more I feel that we are incompatible after all. 

Though he does treat me well overall, I feel like he chose me for the sake of finding someone he could settle down with, instead of a partner he actually loves. I have asked him directly about this, which he neither confirmed nor denied, but gave a very roundabout answer which leads me to believe it is true. I know some people are okay with that and that's fine, but personally, a rs where you don't love your partner isn't quite for me. This made me super sad at first, but slowly that sadness is turning into annoyance somehow. We also tend to have a lot of misunderstanding when we talk about day to day stuff (I've never had such issue when communicating with any of my friends, or even any of the guys I used to date, but somehow we often have miscomms) , which is starting to get on my nerves sometimes. 

What makes breaking up difficult is that we have met each others families (which I now regret introducing him so early) and that he doesn't treat me badly per se. Should I just hold on and try for this or is there no point?

54,"Sorry, long post ahead.

I'm tired of feeling lonely. I don't really have any clique I belong to nor have I had a close friend, for as long as I could remember. 

In primary school, I was constantly bullied. Nobody really liked me, or at least I felt that way. All I could remember was having lunch alone because no one wanted to have lunch with me. Maybe I could also tell from the fact that my class photo during Primary 6 had two versions: one with everyone visibly seen, that was given to me, and another without me in it, given to everyone else in the class.

In secondary school, I've decided to not let my past affect me and tried to make new friends. Sure, I've made casual friends but none I felt connected to. I never get invited to hang out with friends after school and when I was the one doing the invite, everyone suddenly became busy.

In poly, I've had groups of friends that I hang with during classes, but I've always felt like the outside. It was obvious that my friends had their inside jokes and stories. I could still remember the day I felt heartbroken after finding out that we had 2 WhatsApp groups, one with me and another without. That was probably the first time I started to wonder if there's anything wrong with me all this while. Am I annoying? Am I boring? Am I unlikeable? 

NUS days were when things started to feel exponentially worse. I didn't join camps as I was still in NS during that time. So, when I started my first week in NUS, everyone I saw was already in a clique of their own. Maybe it was the anxiety in me or my past experience with people, but I did not dare to approach anyone in class. I'm always sitting alone in lectures and tutorial classes. In between classes, I have my meals in canteen by myself, watching students walk by. At the end of the day, I'm just on the MRT on the way home. Sure, I've interacted with others during group projects, but the interactions stop there. After my last exam paper of every semester, I would watch people talking about going out to celebrate and all I did was just going home and celebrating by myself. I remembered 'celebrating' on my own after my first semester by eating alone at a restaurant. I also remembered crying myself to sleep that night. 

Having been in my first job for about 6 months, I've never felt lonelier. Sure, I'm friends with some of my colleagues but like my previous phases in life, I've felt that the level of friendship is imbalanced. I'm always trying so hard to be close to them, but I know they don't feel as close. Maybe I'm too clingy. Maybe I'm trying too hard that it scares them away. My current routine is just going to work and going home and the cycle repeats. No telegram/WhatsApp messages. No random conversations with friends. No chats with family members at home (We're not very close). I do make the initiative to meet up with friends sometimes, but it rarely happens. 

I’ve tried out new activities/hobbies to distract myself, but the loneliness has recently felt overwhelming. I wanted to try getting to know new people through meetup groups, but I'm so afraid to do so now. 26 years of loneliness has made me feel that I'm terrible at friendships. Every new person I meet is going to be a friend for that phase of my life and just leave afterwards. I try so hard not to have that mentality with every new person I meet but that has always been end result. The weird thing is that a lot of people I've met mentioned things like ""You're so friendly"", ""Why are you so nice?"", ""You're such an easy person to talk to"" but now I'm wondering if all these are just white lies. Maybe they're just statements to cover up for something terrible about me? I'll never know because we don't talk anymore.

I guess the reason why I'm bringing this up recently is because I'm starting to notice changes to myself. I've been getting much more exhausted and unmotivated with more things in life. I tend to stutter whenever I speak now, and my command of language is becoming pretty bad. I know I need help. As I don't have close friends to talk to, I wanted to share it here just to let someone know. Anyone.

I'm tired of feeling lonely. To those I’ve met before, I'm sorry if I was a terrible person to be friends with. To everyone else, please give me a chance.

55,"Does anyone else think it’s becoming more and more challenging to live and communicate with parents as one grows older?
I’ve been quarrelling a lot with my mother lately and it feels so emotionally draining. Probably a part of it is my problem as I’ve been facing a lot of stress at work lately and it’s affecting my mood when i’m at home with my family. But I guess she can be very unreasonable at times too. Let me give some examples to illustrate.
She’s a clean freak bordering on OCD. Every day when I come home from work, instead of asking about how my day went, she’ll nag about how my cleaning is not up to standard, things in my room are not where they’re supposed to be, some of my clothes not ironed immediately after washing, the floor is perpetually dusty...and many more of such trivial stuff. Well, I certainly would do a better job if I’m a full time housekeeper, but I’m not! It’s hard for me just to have peace and quiet after a long day at work.
She’s been a very authoritative parent since I was young and it doesn’t change now that I’m a working adult. She’ll dictate what time I should go to bed and wake up, take my meals and shower. And openly voice her displeasure if I don’t obey or try to reason with her. Sometimes she even makes comments about my outfit and won’t stop until I change to something she prefers. Aren’t all these too much now that I’m all grown up?
At home I totally have no privacy. She’ll open my cupboard and drawers as and when she pleases, and sometimes discards things that she deem not useful without asking for my permission. She’ll judge me on the stuff I have / bought (e.g “I found .... in your drawer, you bought yourself ah? Or someone gave you? Gosh, it’s so ugly.”). Don’t understand why she must do such things, sigh. 
The worst thing is that she nags at me endlessly for being single and not proactively looking for a bf. She’ll keep hinting at how many of her friends have become grandmas, and sometimes when she’s unwell or in bad mood she’ll loudly exclaim, “Aiya wanna die also cannot die in peace, my daughter still not married,” making me feel bad like I’m such a burden in her life :( Well, the reason I’m single now is that I used to get cheated on by my long term bf 2 yrs ago and I’m still living with the trauma until now, so I feel very deeply hurt when she says such things...
I do not despise my mother in any way, deep down I still love and respect her. Just that at times I got really frustrated and in desperate need for some space, autonomy and privacy now that I’m a working adult. And I wish she won’t keep forcing me to find a bf when I’m not ready.
Any suggestions on how to deal with such a parent will be much appreciated. Unfortunately moving out is not an option as I’m not earning much and don’t think I can afford the rent.

I am really still a virgin girl. I sleep with teddy bears and dolls in my bed. I never got hugged to sleep. I never hugged a living,breathing human being to sleep. I never cuddled with anybody under a cosy blanket. My life is always super simple, I just go to school study, graduate, and work in an office (of course I’m not saying where I found employment as this is strictly anonymous) and I never check anyone’s text messages but my own. 

Is this why (not sure why, that’s why I’m asking, it’s open to discussion really!) I have “no feelings”? 

I feel nothing. Nothing! 

Other girls with sexual encounters already are extremely different from me. They naturally bawl their eyes out at sad romantic movies, while I can’t understand what romance is. They just feel touched enough to cry whenever something sad/moving happens between the man and woman on film. All these complex emotions.......while I’m trying my best to feel what it’s like to be even loved in the first place??? 

I watched as those with proper boyfriends check on their texts to make sure they aren’t cheating/texting their exes? But I don’t have a single shred of love in my life, so I don’t get why people can get so paranoid? Some even worry about their boyfriend not texting back in a minute (?!) and I’m like.....sometimes my sister doesn’t reply for the whole day and I’m like okay with it? 

But I don’t like myself this way. I desperately Want to change. I want to stop being someone with no feelings. I want to experience love too. 

I am on dating apps but no stranger ever asked me to even meet for a one night stand. I also go clubbing but Nobody asked me to go home with them after clubbing. 

Hypothetically speaking, if let’s say I begin to go on one night stands and actually have some form of skinship, I will also experience what love and romance are right? When it comes to songs and movies, will  I also feel so touched that I cry? 

I really never cried at a single song or movie before. What can I do about this?

59,"Sorry in advance: long post to which I'm tearing to...I dont even know why but it's just a rush of past feelings. 

I've been with my boyfriend for about 6 years now. We have been good but the beginning was pretty hard...I thought I got better but the insecurities are coming back. 
*
A little background: He is verrryy good looking - albeit singaporean, people would often ask if he is local (don't know why the heck singaporeans don't think singaporean guys can be good looking) and compliment his looks. 
I'm average I would say, but definitely not model look material. But also, I had no qualms over his above average looks or this attention. Partly because I thought I was very secure (based on my past relationships) and thought this would be the same. He also chased me for quite a long period as I was initially not keen in a rhsp. 

Although, sometimes it stung a little - when we went out, people would compliment his looks. When we go to family gatherings, people would again compliment his looks. I get the compliments but sometimes I feel it's just for the sake of. And guys are not the only ones who would chase attached girls...I've had other girls try to squeeze their way into our relationship to get his attention (attempt to initiate physical contact in a sexual manner, text daily etc).

But I always reminded myself that we both have our strengths, I'm the brain of the relationship and have had charted a successful pathway for myself (I've helped him build his intelligence appetite largely too). But no one really sees that. Cause yes..looks win. 

And in the beginning of our relationship, he did give in to the attention from girls (reply their messages, flirt back) because it was new to him (coming from a boys school) and so I turned from being a super secure girl to a pretty insecure one. We had huge fights...and since then, I've always had this tiny insecurity streak in me. I let it go through lots of talk with him (he has drawn boundaries and have been loyal) and self reflection but I always have this doubt that he has a upper hand, and can, and MAY cheat. 

Presently...

He started working (he has always worked in a male dominated env) and not surprisingly, the attention has begun and girls have began throwing themselves at him. He used to be pretty naive & assumed this actions (from obviously interested girls) were not to lead him on but I'm a girl and I know. He has been telling me what they've been trying to do and his responses have been kept to a friendly manner but I just cant seem to trust him. He knows he is good looking and I'm afraid the attention gets to his head again and he starts to flirt back. I do feel disgusted at myself for being so insecure....but I'm so tired. 

I sometimes wish I wasn't dating such a good looking person because it makes feel like shit about myself and I feel that I'm not strong enough to deal with the shit that comes with it. All the thoughts and what ifs...should I just end it? 

Has anyone had a similar experience? How do you deal with it? I'm really hoping to salvage this relationship before my insecurities build again...because I foresee this to be a long term issue.

I was working part-time at a bubble tea store when this incident happened.

There was this customer who ordered bubble tea and requested for lesser sugar for his bubble tea. I made him a cup of bubble tea with 80% sugar. 

After taking a sip, he complaint to the senior staff that he requested for lesser sugar, but I didn't reduce the sugar level enough. His definition of lesser is 50%

Fortunately, the senior staff didn't blame me for it. It could be possible that that senior staff was a nice guy(definitely one of the reasons) or my senior staff felt that it wasn't my fault.

Do you all think it was my fault? I felt that the customer was partially at fault for using the vague word ""lesser"" instead telling me more clearly that he actually wanted 50% or half sugar.

I brought you to meet my friends because i want you to feel assured that i wanted a future with you. How i wished we had more chance to have double dates. I took time out to meet you even though i was so tired and not feeling well. How many times did i crash in my bed the moment i settled down at home and yet i sounded so energetic in my texts? How many times do you know i was unwell and stressing to get myself well again so that we could meet as agreed? How many times did i thank you because i was afraid you would think that I'm taking you for granted. 

But how many times did you appreciate what i did for you? How many times did you encourage me when i felt like giving up.

All these because I want you to feel loved. But I didn't know what i need to do to make you happy. So i tried every possible ways i could think of. 
How many times did i reach out to you to communicate with me. All you did was to crack some jokes or change the topic to ignore my question. How much i wish to know more of your world and what you have been through - the good the bad and the things you did - the good and the bad. 

We both lost in this relationship. We lost to communication. 

And then it came to me that the best way to make you happy is to end this, no matter how much i didn't want to. I need to set you free. 

Maybe you were also disappointed in me in some way. But that i will never know. I'm sorry. I love you.

92,"What are your thoughts about a 100% inheritance tax regime, or in the alternative, that inheritance should be capped at a certain amount (e.g. $100,000)? 

1. Reducing Income Inequality
The first and most obvious consequence is the reduction of income inequality in the country. The rising income inequality has caused much unhappiness not just in Singapore but many countries around the world. In fact, one of the reasons for the civil unrest in Hong Kong was that there was a huge disparity in income between the classes of people where the few rich individuals hold much of the country’s wealth. With inheritance tax, the rich can no longer pass on their wealth to their offspring and this allows the country to redistribute the wealth in the country. While this may seem unfair to the ultra-rich, perhaps the welfare of the masses should take precedent over the interests of the ultra-rich who have already enjoyed their wealthy lives.  

2. Promoting meritocracy and encouraging hard work
The idea of meritocracy is that people are rewarded for their hard work, talent, efforts etc., rather than wealth or social class. The offspring of ultra-high net worth individuals would, upon the demise of their parents, inherit millions (if not billions) without accomplishing anything in life. This is unfair to those who slog all their lives but not accumulate even 1% of the inherited wealth and it is purely a game of luck – whether you are born in a rich or poor family. As everyone starts off from a fresh sheet of paper, people (including those from wealthy families) are motivated to work hard so that they can be rewarded in life. 

3. Allowing the state to fund for local universities
With the money collected from inheritance, the state can provide free university education to every Singaporean (like some European countries). This allows everyone to compete equally with the same level of education, further promoting meritocracy in the country. Currently, those who are less fortunate are unable to pursue further education due to the costs of education (a degree in local universities costs $25k to $50k).

4. Removal of other taxes like income tax and property tax 
The inheritance tax (which taxes the dead) can possibly replace the current income tax and property tax (which taxes the living). This is also the reason why inheritance tax has been dubbed the “fairest tax”. With the removal of living taxes, people can spend all the money that they have earned on the things they want. 

Potential arguments and counterarguments:
1. People can evade this by through gifts before they die – this can be resolved via gift tax.
2. People should be entitled to leave what they have saved to their offspring – this is a fair point but in exchange for giving up the inheritance the state provides free university education to every citizen to ensure that they can be self-sufficient. 
3. People can spend all their money before they die, leaving the state with no money – the state can still obtain its funds via GST (more revenue from GST as consumption increases). This also promotes the country’s economy through an increase in aggregate demand.
4. There is no point in putting money in CPF – the purpose of CPF is to ensure that citizens are self-sufficient after their retirement, rather than for the sake of passing the money down to their offspring. In any case, it may form part of the limit on the amount of inheritance as mentioned at the beginning. 


tldr: there are many benefits accruing from an inheritance tax regime, such as reduction in income inequality, promoting meritocracy, free university education, removal of living taxes etc. would you support inheritance tax?

93,"hey so I am a female year 3 student in nus. Although I have a small group of good friends from JC and high school I really do treasure a lot, I don't have a lot of friends in uni to hang out with and it has been like this since I was a freshman. Sometimes it is difficult to hang with my closer friends because of school and some of them are in relationships too. I used to have a boyfriend who has graduated from nus, but we broke up. So my question is, how do people cope with loneliness? Sometimes I feel so alone, I will just sit in my bed and cry. Sometimes it even brings my focus away from my academics. It is kinda hard at times too seeing others in happy and committed relationships, because I do crave the intimacy and commitment that comes with relationships. Some guys showed interest in me but I wasn't really into any of them and being with someone solely to fill this void isn't a great idea. I tried looking for friends online but we just didn't really hit it off. I have been attempting to work on myself - travelling overseas alone, working out, reading and planning my study schedule for this semester. Yet everyday I still fall asleep and wake up with this emptiness in my heart. The only times I don't feel this way is when I am having fun with my close friends, on vacation with my family or when I had my ex with me. How do people lead fulfilling single lives without feeling like they have to wait for people to hang with them or a boyfriend they can love to come along?

100,"Sex before or after marriage, why does it even matter? 

If one takes a scroll through the comment sections of posts with the word “virgin” or “virginity” inside, the common consensus of those commenting are “its the 21st century why are you being so narrow minded”, or “go to IMH and seek help la”. The idea of pre-marital sex is oftentimes ridiculed on this platform, albeit sometimes there are neutral parties who rightfully so, asks the OP to “respect the partner’s wishes”.

Here is what i think about this issue, and if you frankly don’t care, feel free to scroll past this post. Firstly, I fully agree that virginity is a social construct, and deeming females as impure just because they engage in pre-marital sex is a ridiculous notion. However, I strongly believe that if someone wishes to date a virgin, or subscribe to the idea of post marital sex, their concerns and requirements should be seen as valid and acceptable, and not subject to ridicule as seen in the recent posts. 

As mentioned earlier, virginity is a social construct where our perspective on it is shaped by our education, experiences, peers, school, family and most importantly, oneself. So why are we trying to put people down with differing opinions and legitimate concerns? Why are we not more accepting of the differing ideas and moral values of other people? While i strongly disagree that pre-marital sex makes one impure or immoral, I find it shocking that people are labelling OP’s with differing opinions as “lonely and virgin forever”, or “crazy go to IMH la”.

And to those OP’s who are trying to convince their partners to change their mindset, please do so in a respectful manner. Like I have mentioned earlier, one’s perspective on virginity is based on a multitude of factors, and just because you are horny does not mean that she’s crazy or too strict. Please support your partner fully through this transition if that is really what you want, or respect each other’s wishes and wait.

108,"#74972 Apologies for an equally long post. Readers please ignore rambling from somewhat old graduates.  

To the unappreciated peer, given you have worked 7.5 years and 2 jobs or more, I assumed that you would have learnt that's just life. So I'm not sure what type of answers that you are seeking.  Anyway I have worked exactly the same no. of years and jobs as you, although I have probably benefited from favoritism instead of suffered from it in both firms.  Some thoughts off my mind.

-Your way of doing work/thinking sound a bit overly focused on KPIs or being too robotic? Being too much of a robot can peeve your boss, so maybe you should rework and reduce your one-way speaking sessions. Networking may help in overall career progression, but it is beyond those 1-1 sessions. I have never really paid too much attention to it though.  

-The way towards promotion and career goal is less structured , it is not like playing a game. It is not a case of talk to people > find quests > complete quests > earned experience > level up. Don't be too obsessed with the ""how to"". Your way of interacting with people, the work you do (if it is good) and etc will naturally form the foundation of your career progression. 

-Your method of being hard to replace is wrong. Unnecessary overtime (e.g. standby during public holidays), and doing too many saikang will simply sap your energy and do not count towards your employee value. You're a hardworking and perhaps somewhat important employee, but not A-team / inner circle. We also have a long working life ahead of us, and official retirement age will keep getting extended. Bro, take a chill pill.

-Saikang / special projects's importance may increase at higher level, but its real value is really as an office politics (OP) tool such as proving value to CEO, proving value over other departments. I did some and still gives my best since it is still BAU and everyone has to do some saikang. But I have never been too ardent to use it to get into the right people's good books. I don't deny that it is a good way to get promotion, but the OP road is too overpowering for me.  

-Never neglect your real work over saikang, do a few if you have to or inevitable. Being good in your real work may not be the most important consideration in promotion in some organisations. But thankfully, this approach is good enough for me in both firms. In addition, the skills/knowledge built from real work are the transferable skill sets. The winning sensation you get from gaming the OP is not transferable. But if you do intend to stay within the firm for life, you probably will have to invest some skill points into OP..

-Homegrown is obviously important, but being non-homegrown will not be a limiting factor except in organisations which being pure-blood vampires are important as a firm culture. Private organisations are generally better. Are you given sufficient opportunities, are you given proper work? Make use of what you have. 

-Human relationship is complicated. Frequency, personalities and etc play a part. You can't be best buddies with all the quest givers unlike in a game. 

-Quit if you have to or it is too extreme. If you are a quality employee and thus feeling unappreciated for good reasons, lack of appreciation is a small issue. Don't brood over it too much. Happiness > everything.

I thought we were progressing pretty well, chatting and meeting up so often, always sharing about our days and complaining about our problems. I'm sure you already know I like you, I've been explicit. But your responses are so mixed it's giving me hope only to constantly pull them away again. I know you try to be friendly to everyone, but many of your actions to me are different and could mean so much more. Of course I have wool over my eyes. 

Then I realised you had the ""habit"" of sometimes replying halfway, and sometimes not even checking our chat even though you're always online. I was blindly infatuated and just ignored it once, twice, many times. But communication is my love language, I felt that I was putting in all the effort maintaining the conversations.

I'm sure you didn't notice, but I've started to pull back, to reread our conversations and realise that most of the time it's just me initiating, you only doing so rarely. Days without replying even though you read the msg, then replying like it's nothing. Or replying on another app. 


I kept painting a picture to my friends that hey maybe you are the one. But now I have to take care of myself first. I really love you, but chat after chat you're just not putting in as much effort in conversations as I hope you would. 

Maybe it's time I move on. You don't owe me anything anyway, since we didn't go official. Have I already fell to the friendzone without even knowing? I hate that you feel bad for ignoring people, even those you friendzoned, yet you ignore me then replying like nothing happened.

I didn’t recognised the guy at first until I asked him if I knew him. He mentioned his name and introduced the girl besides him as his gf, suddenly the world dark for a while. He’s a guy from the same jc as me and he was my best friend. The fact that I forgot about him bcoz something had happened during college time. We were in the same water polo team and went for quite a number of tournaments. To make it fast forward, we were about to go on our own path, I ended up in NUS while he went to oversea to study.

Few days before he fly, he stayed at my home, had a few drinks, talked a lot on sports and out of nowhere, we ended up staring at each other. It was the time where I do realised he is such a fine guy, perhaps the most good looking guy I had ever seen that time. The fact that I never had a feelings to any guys but I don’t even know why he came into me. The basorexic feelings killing me, staring at his luscious lips, moving away my sight immediately after.

Out of sudden, his hand pulling my neck and brought my face near to his, ended up kissing each other. His lips so soft that I don’t even want to cut the kiss. We ended up cuddled on my bed while he was kissing me hardly. I never knew that the raging hormone of this young guy so strong. Maybe because we were drunk at that time but the fact that I able to remember each moment until now, I don’t think I am. We never talked about that night since then and we ended up losing in contact after.

Back to present, I was immersed in those memories until he called me by my name and asked me whether I am okay. I am okay after all these years without him. He asked me why I never in contact with him all these while and I don’t even know how to answer it. ‘It is good to see you, it has been a while’. It was an awkward short conversation, he was the one who is excited and I am blunt as always. We never talked about past time as I don’t want to think about it anymore. The fact that he is having a gf now, it is time for him to be happy. 

I ended up ordered my drink and sat somewhere else. He and his gf sat quite far from my table. Suddenly, a waiter came to me and handed a plate of croissant. I never ordered it but the waiter told me that the guy in white shirt ordered for me, He is my friend from earlier on and I looked at him from far, he looked at me and gave me a good smile.

118,"I'm the OP of #74946, the one asking for ways to counteract workplace favouritism.

To provide abit more context (I really want to solve this issue I guess):

- No, my boss and Person A are not sleeping together FOR SURE. They are the same gender, both got their own families with children. 

- I've actually been with the firm for 5 years already. Person A has been with the firm for 6.5 years. For a mere 1.5year difference, I don't think the ROI matters that much. In fact, I was at my previous firm for 2.5 years and being with my current firm double the number of years speak volumes about my willingness to stay and stick around. To allay my boss' distrust, I've mentioned multiple times that I won't leave and I'm also bonded (the firm pays for all my upgrading qualifications, which I've continuously been taking for the past 5 years to better prep myself while Person A didn't) as a sign of my commitment. 

- And yes, I talk to my boss whether it's work-wise or personal-wise or career-wise. I have multiple projects with my boss. My boss knows my ultimate career goal - communicated it across several times, knows I'm working hard towards it and I will personally schedule time to talk about career progression, my views on the team (I already lead one), how we can do better, and just general catch up on life - I do notice that these sessions seem to be abit one-sided though, like it's coming alot more from my own proactiveness and initiative. Of course Person A does it too, but the boss always seem more receptive (like in a better mood after coming back from these coffee sessions with Person A).

- I've also tried being ""hard to replace"" like how one commenter mentioned - I put my hand up most frequently, do the projects that no one wants to do, standby during public holidays, help out with business development and things generally to be done outside of work hours (otherwise known as saikang lol), help out whenever the team is busy, and my juniors have given me glowing reviews year after year. These are things that Person A does not have. 

It has come to a point where I feel that I've tried hard and things are stagnated, for reasons beyond my comprehension and control. I'm really unsure what else I have to do to appease my boss, and sometimes I feel like a slave/taken for a ride. 

Tts why I feel that at the end of the day, nothing I've done will satisfy my boss, and nothing I do moving forward will. I'm not sure if anybody here has ever been in my shoes and managed to turn things around, if so, would really love to hear from u. Oh and thanks for reading, oops another long post.

Really want to warn (prospective) students: don't do PhD in NUS Chemistry. Don't do undergraduate Chemistry in NUS too. If they don't care about their higher level students, they definitely won't care about undergraduates. Just avoid Chemistry department for the sake of your sanity and mental health.

We became close quickly and share our problems with each other. I was quite interested in her, until she revealed that she actually has a boyfriend in NS. She keeps sending me mixed signals, such as asking me out, taking selfies together, going out for movies as if I were her boyfriend. I think she is unconsciously using me as a substitute since her boyfriend is busy in NS. I don't want to get in the way of their relationship, doesn't feel right to me but sometimes I hope they would breakup.

129,"How do u tell whether a boss is practicing favouritism in the workplace and how do u counteract that?

Headsup, this is quite a long post ahead. 

I am an executive working in a global firm. There are also 4 other executives (ie same rank), and we are all quite similar in terms of educational background, with 1 - 2 yrs difference in age. The skillsets we have are also broadly the same, but  because we work on different projects, there are some differences in the kind of exposure and experience we had.

I've noticed that my boss is particularly nice to one of the executives (let's just call the person A). Now don't get me wrong, my boss is generally friendly and will smile/talk to others in a calm manner, not like those horrible bosses u see in movies.

By acts of niceness I mean: by giving A opportunities to speak up, only asking for A's views in meetings, letting A run the bigger projects most of the time, following up with A when A comes back from holidays and asking A whether A feels overwhelmed, need more staffing resources etc etc.

Even though it feels like my boss sometimes 'wakes up' and treats the other executives better as well (like asking if we also need resources or spends effort coaching us), I can't help but feel that boss prefers A based on the number of times that boss is nice to A. I am guessing that it is because the only difference between the rest of us and A is that - A is homegrown ie has started career in this firm and stayed on throughout. A is not the most experienced (in terms of number of years working in this line) amongst us. This 'loyal' trait is very similar to my boss' own background - staying in one firm throughout, while the rest of us started our careers elsewhere before moving to the present firm. Plus because there was a period of time when we had massive turnover, it seems to me that the boss is afraid of people leaving and therefore feels that only homegrown employees are loyal will stay long and can be groomed.

If this continues, I'm concerned that when it comes to promotions, pay rise and general career progression, the boss will favour A too, since A gets the best exposure, best resources and best learning experience and naturally would perform better. Is this considered favouritism in such situations, and what can I do for myself and my career? Prof Ben, any wise words?

It was sort of our honeymoon period and he had to enlist recently. While I'm feeling a sudden sense of emptiness during this transition phase, I believe he is having a tougher time inside. With the limited texting we have, I am a bit lost on what can I do or say to encourage and support him throughout. I kind of realised there's nothing much I can do to help.

Furthermore, I am not expecting him to spend all of his book-out time with me as he will probably be tired, need to rest, get some me-time or spend it with his friends or family. Hence, I'm thinking of just having a shorter, non-strenuous date like a simple bonding over meal, but will this get mundane overtime?

Any advice on how to cope with this transition is very much appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Vegan options are few. Expensive/atas-looking options so many. I think I can speak for the majority of us when I say that we really dont need so many weird (or the other extreme: repetitive) concepts to open on campus. We need honest vendors who are good, reliable, and relatively affordable.

Furthermore, some smart person decides that phd supervisor's approval is needed before one can bid for mods.

138,"I've been dating this girl for about half a year. She's smart, kind, funny, pretty and mature. Overall, she's a down-to-earth and easygoing person. What I like most about her is she's very supportive and understanding. She doesn't expect much from me and she gives me the freedom to do whatever I want. 

The thing is she's pretty laid back, unmotivated and always jokes about her dreams of being a 'taitai'. She puts in minimal effort into her job and dislikes anything that requires effort e.g. working, doing housework, exercising, travelling, shopping, etc. 

But she puts in a lot of effort into our relationship. She would cook meals for me, make handmade gifts for me, listen to me rant about my work and save up to buy me all the things I like. 

I'm amazed by the crazy amount of effort she puts into making me happy. But sometimes I have doubts whether she's doing all these because she loves me or because I can give her the life she dreams of. 

I like to shower her with gifts and take her to a nice meal. I also discussed with her that I can afford for the both of us if she wants to be a stay home mom and that money won't be an issue at all. 

Last week, I introduced her to my family. We went to eat Haidilao and throughout the meal, she kept cooking the meat and veg for me and my family. My parents even had to remind her to eat more because she wasn't really eating. She kept smiling and laughing while trying to hold a conversation with my family. 

I was quite shocked that she was way more friendly and helpful than usual at the dinner. It seems like she was trying very hard to impress me and my family. Which pushes me to doubt her even more. 

How to know if a person truly loves you? I feel touched by the things she does for me but I also wonder if she would still love me if I am not as successful and unable to provide for her. Am I too cynical?

Was reading every comment. Yeah I know it's pretty cringy and seemed unreal, but yes, what I described really was the situation. I do agree on the meet first, and yes, it will be public place like a normal meetup. 

One of the comment mentioned it might be game banter; game banter was with A, not B. B goes out of the way to remember and be concerned on little things I mentioned. He does it on his own accord, on the basis I had rejected him a couple of times previously. This was what touched me and I wasn't sure how to feel.

To clarify things, most of the comments seem to have mistaken my PoV. I have no intentions or whatsoever to come in between A and his wife. My only concern here is that I might be short-changing B and only liked B's care but not him as a person (Because I liked A previously). So it was more of a Do-I-give-both-of-us-a-chance situation or like one of the comment mentioned, since I wasn't physically-attracted from photo, he don't really deserve the lesser me.

My girlfriend doesnt like me hanging out with a friend of mine mainly cause she sees him as shady (capable of cheating on his girlfriend and stuff like that) and has been overbearing whenever I hang out with him with constant calls just to check that I'm not doing anything shady as well. Shes firm about me not hanging out with him but I do fight for my rights cause hes one of my guys.
As such I've lied to her on a couple of occasions when I went out drinking with him and other friends but told her I was at home sleeping. 
However I have previously explained that whatever his morals may be regarding cheating or anything in that regard, doesnt compromise my own. He can ask me out to places with other girls and I've never made the decision to cheat on her both emotionally and physically.
As a result of this, she now constantly demands my live location and video calls me to check up on me that I am where I said I would be. This happens even when I'm with other (non shady) friends in her opinion. 
My problem is that I know she genuinely cares for me, but her paranoia is driving me pretty nuts, and I feel like I cant keep up if she keeps doing nonsense like check up on me, demanding to look at my messages and perform random interrogations when I'm with her. I want to give her that sense of trust but I cant give in to her demand of me letting go of a friend just cause she thinks he has shaky morals.

Last semester, I had four finals. I remember I studied till very late and I snack a lot. Like literally a lot. I swear I ate a house full of chips, cookies and some sugary candies. I was so hungry while studying in UTown. I stay in a hall by the way. So what happened was that I had a bad stomachache. I couldn’t unload my faeces naturally. It feels like entering the JB custom - always jammed. The night before my first paper, I did not shit. I hold my shit throughout the examination as I was so stressed and worried for my paper. I silently farted and I think it affected the people around me so badly that they were complaining to the invigilators. I even saw the guy beside me almost vomited by giving an awful expression. It hurts me so bad that my farts are making people around me uncomfortable. I tried my best to hold them but I couldn’t. I kept letting waves of smelly farts during the whole duration of the examination. As a result, some of the people around me did not complete their paper and submitted half-answered paper. I glanced and I saw. I was so remorseful about this. I observed the same trend for the other three papers. I told my best friend after this. She told me it was not my intention and I shouldn’t feel bad about it. As a shy girl always, I don’t know what to do.

167,"As a girl, who would you rather choose? A good-looking guy from Business with straight A, who still has time to do sports every evening at the field and has a car? He could easily be the perfect husband and the two of us could have a very bright future together.

Or some unremarkable artist guy from some local art school who seems gloomy, awkward, definitely not good-looking and with less chances of finding a high paying career (unlike the former). However he creates beautiful comic book drawings that the inner nerd in me yearns to sit down with him and talk about our shared interests.

I prefer the former but he does not watch a lot of movies, listens to different kinds of music or interested in any pop culture like me. The latter he’s very interesting as a person, but hates sports and prefer unhealthy living plus he’s below average in looks. I need some advice so I would not choose the wrong person.

If the guy/girl wants sex but his/her partner doesn't want to (e.g. want to wait till after marriage), he/she can either accept the partner's decision and still be together or break up if he/she can't accept the partner's decision. Go and do more comprehension exercises la.

169,"Legit question. Do girls get intimidated if a guy is ""too perfect""? 

The girl I like says she feels insecurities that ""I'm out of her league"" and that ""I may leave her"" for better girls. She says she feels average and there's no reason for me to like her. 

But I do. I find her attractive in her own way, but love is a funny thing and I find it hard to put it in words. I was taken aback and stunned, I didn't know what to say.  I struggled to give her a reply. I felt like it made her even more insecure that I gave her a general reply. 

How do I make her feel comfortable and trust that I'll not leave her? I feel like she's waiting for me to say something. 

Guys, what would you have said if a girl said something like this? 

Girls, what do you expect from a guy if you were in her shoes?

All this while, while reading confessions I noticed that her comments were not only harsh but more often than not, unnecessary. You come from a place of condescension... and it’s very clear. Maybe you genuinely want to help because of this bank of life experience you have, and you probably know you’re above average looking and therefore would get more support likes-wise and so yes it emboldens you to comment freely. HOWEVER, take caution and be kind, you’re still young, and you may not have as much going as you think. You are entitled to your opinion, but you have to drop this mindset that you always hold the right view lol.

171,"Hi everyone so I’ve been dating my gf for almost 2 years already and it’s been going smoothly but in the early stages of dating she told me she had sex before with 2 other guys and me being a virgin at the time felt a bit jealous because they were other guys who had seen her naked and it makes me fee uncomfortable and uneasy at times. Maybe I was under the impression that “If I’m a virgin, then I’ll go look for a virgin too and we’ll lose it together” but it didn’t turn out like that. Everytime I have these thoughts and I bring it up to her she thinks that I’m shaming her for her past so I have kept these uncomfortableness to myself I just want to know if this is normal to feel like this? What can I do? I really need help.

Usually his comments are posted on confessions about r/s and advising others on their love problems. Occasionally flaunting how well he treats his girlfriend and how he maintain his r/s with her.  But y’all know his profile is fake one anot? 

He literally using two accounts, one as the girlfriend (operating it himself/herself) and one as the boyfriend (operating himself/herself too) And the two accounts always tags each other on different post etc etc and it’s quite active de leh. For example he post a status, saying how cute his gf is. His gf will reply to that post wor. But actually both is same person, he talking to himself only. Actually hor, the photos he using for the guy profile and girl profile is this couple from china. He still happy happy everyday say his girlfriend very pretty woh. You all know who? 

The real couple of those photo he use was literally in china the whole time in december, but he stole their photo and reposted it using the ‘girlfriend’ fb account to say she went paris leh! Paris in where? Singapore ah? Since he doing this kind of thing to himself probably at home in singapore. 

That day he also commented on a mothership post saying his gf pretty, i exposed him and ask him why he using other people photo and having literal split personality by replying to himself using two account, he straight delete comment bro. You all got any idea is who?? ;)

175,"Ang moh student here. I want to share a little story... I went to FairPrice today to buy some groceries as the trip has been long overdue. The store appeared to be very busy, as it was after work hours for most people. Once I was done shopping, I got to the tills and jumped between several tills to try and beat the crowds. At the last till I waited, it seemed to take forever, so I became a bit inpatient and at the same time annoyed, that it was taking such a long time. I honestly couldn’t understand why it was taking so long when the other queues appeared to be moving faster. As I got closer to the till, I saw an auntie behind that was scanning the products and bagging them for the customer in front.  She appeared to be older than 60 years old and although it seemed like she was doing everything very slowly, I could tell that she was trying to rush and do it as fast as she could. I instantly felt extremely bad for getting a bit annoyed and wondering why the check-out couldn’t be faster. After  having a good look at her, I looked around and realised that most of the staff members appear to be elders but that doesn’t stop them from doing a fantastic job. My heart clenched at the realisation that people of this age have to still continue working. It made me really, really upset, but at the same time angry, as I see posts on here about people asking whether they should give some money to their parents. 

My mum also works at an unqualified job and this really hit close to home, as I could picture her in this situation since she is alone and has no savings. The point I’m making: please take care of your parents and for god’s sake, give these people a well deserved break by providing a state pension like any western country. If this country has the money to pay every boy to go to the army for a year and a half, why doesn’t it have money to provide state pension?

176,"A few weeks ago I went out with a guy I met on a dating app. We chatted for a week before meeting for the first time. We had coffee at a cafe and watched a movie after that. Towards the end of the movie, he suddenly touched my boobs. I was stunned but remained calm. 

I questioned him after the movie and he said he couldn't resist it because my boobs are so big. WTF? I told him I'm not feeling well and went home straightaway. I felt so angry and stupid. Like why did I go out with this scumbag. 

I decided to avenge myself because well, I am young and foolish and immature. I created a fake account and tried to find his profile. Using my fake account, I approached him on the app and asked him on a date. He lives in Punggol so I purposely asked him to meet outside a shop in a shopping mall in Jurong while I sit down at a nearby cafe with my bestfriend, enjoying my cup of coffee and watching him like a stalker.

I told him I will be late and asked him to wait for me. So he foolishly waited for 30 minutes. He then texted me again and asked me where I was. So I lied to him that I'm having diarrhoea and stuck in the toilet at home. So he waited for another 30 minutes. It was so entertaining to watch him stand outside a shop and constantly check his phone for messages from a person who would never show up.

My friend and I decided that we had enough fun so I texted him that I have to bail on him because something came up. I then deleted my fake account right away. The look on his face when he saw the message. Priceless. 

Guys and girls, beware of people you meet on dating apps. Try to meet at crowded places and avoid dark or secluded places. Be safe or end up becoming a pyscho like me ;)

178,"I refer to #74741 about the dude who has a gf with low-sex drive. I see many comments bashing the dude about how he does not respect her and how he needs to control himself. I think this post would have gotten a much more different reaction had the gender roles been switched.

I don't think the dude is wrong in thinking that they may be incompatible in the future. Sex is by and large a huge part of a relationship, and it is important when you want to go long term with your partner. Just because you prioritise sex does not mean you cannot control your urges - you just need to find someone who can communicate with you on the same level on this issue.

So here's my advice - if the issue (whether it be sex, religion, career or family) is high up on your list of things you consider important in a relationship, don't settle for less. Find someone who can see eye-to-eye with you on the important matters, because if you close one eye on them near the beginning of your relationship, these are the things that can cause a divide when the going gets tough. 

Communicate and make a decision. Don't settle just because you have committed time or money into a relationship. If it is that important to you, you will be able to find someone who can agree with you on it. 

TLDR: just because you love someone, does not mean that you let go of what is important to you.

So I find it unsettling that companies are applauded for stopping to give away straws or plastic bags. I mean aren't they the ones benefitting the most out of this. 

First, I believe companies could reduce some cost from this campaign(I know the amount is insignificant but money is money). Second, they could gain some PR exposure out of this. I am not saying that I disagree with the campaign but they are the ones offering those things in the first place as some form of ""complimentary service"" to the customer, so technically omitting those ""complimentary service"" (and not giving away alternative in place of this) only benefit their side.

If these companies would say like they would donate the money that they could have used for getting those straws or plastic bag then that is something that could be applauded but I have never heard something like this before. So I guess the whole stuff more like PR campaign?

It's quite obvious that she no longer has interest in this friendship/relationship for whatever reason. The question is are you affected enough to want to confront her about it? I'm assuming that if you are troubled enough to pen down your worries and post it here, you probably want a proper reason from her and perhaps closure.

It doesn't have to be weird : you could just ask her if something is bothering her lately and if not, why does it feel that she is ignoring you. If she answers you directly - CONGRATS OP!! If she doesn't, then it's really up to you to decide if you want to push her for your answers.

It seemed mutual. I thought we had a thing but it turns out she just completely ghosted me during the vacation. 

We were so close during the semester. I don't understand why she ghosted me. She seemed very genuine during the semester. Not like the kind of girl with a motive. 

But right now when I try to talk to her she'll seem cold and uninterested. We used to talk every day. Now she's not initiating convos and when I do, she'll give me one word replies. She seems like she doesn't want this anymore.

Sometimes it makes me feel like I'm just being annoying and I trying to talk to her is just pestering her. It feels stupid trying to talk to her when she doesn't want to talk. I don't know what happened or if it's something I did wrong. 

Right now, I don't know how to continue this 'relationship'. It's hard to continue when the other person is making it feel 'one-way' even tho it used not be. And it's hard to let her know how I feel or ask her directly since we are not exactly boyfriend girlfriend.

What should I do? How should I continue treating her? How do I get things to be like the way it used to? Should I continue helping her if she approaches me for homework help again? idk if im being used or if it's just a misunderstanding. I still like her a lot

I'm a regular participant here. Sometimes really cuz I have nothing better to do on commutes because mobile games don't appeal to me.

But of late I find toxic comments and trolling to be the norm, even on posts where OP was obviously in distress and needed some kind of emotional support, encouragement, or just some advice.

""It's the internet"" you say. My faith in democracy died in 2016 with Trump and Brexit winning in the polls, and again with Boris Johnson winning in 2019. I think the internet remains the last unmolested vestige of unadulterated democracy, and yet again democracy has proven to me that it's not worth saving.

It saddens me to see democracy behind the cloak of anonymity so rotten to the core that we don't even have the basic human decency to be at least minimally civilised.

What's sadder is that we're supposed to be the cream of the crop, the exemplar of humanity. Or maybe just at the very least, not this very cesspool of toxicity. Surely that's not too much to ask!

He appears to hide things really well.. Never seen him openly messaging on  whatsapp. There is a few occasions when he on his phone, its showing a text which a girl has sent.. It was too fasr for me to catch futher glimpse of the message.

He don't seem like the sort (studious kind of guy) whom will play with girls or am I underestimating his ability?

Sometimes he plans dates on the day itself. If he wants to genuinely ask me out, he would have plan a day before at the very least? Or it is normal? 

He always avoids answering directly to my questions as well... 

I recently also found out that he has been hanging out with a group of girls which he has never spoken to me before. He has never mentioned to me before when I asked him how was his day and what he did for the day. When i questioned him, he says he never thought that it is something he would need to report to me. He says it is after project group works where they will hangout after.

I will get mad everytime but after he dismisses my thoughts, I will let it go. Am I living in denial? Is he cheating?

201,"@ The OP of #74787 :
Honestly, it sounds like the girl has lost interest in you. Either that, or she’s the type of girl (I’d know well, being one myself) who likes the chase. When you meet someone new, they are completely foreign and mysterious to you. It’s thrilling and exciting to talk to them. However, after a while, they become familiar to you and the excitement is gone. This is especially so if she had realised on some level that you already have feelings for her. 

My advice to you: Stop texting her and being at her beck and call. Don’t initiate any conversations or plans with her, but don’t completely ice her out if she makes a move on you. Simply put, only talk to her if she’s the one who talks to you first. Maybe get to know some other girls or at least make yourself look busy. Good luck!

I was always punctual, never committed any mistake, never taken leave or MC. I took pride in my work. I even enjoyed doing what I do. However, I always fail my probation, mostly because I'm not suitable for the job or I'm not good enough. I'm so upset I don't even feel like finding a job anymore. I just keep a lookout every now and then. Now I just spend my time on hobbies, housework and classes to pick up some skills.

I count myself lucky because my parents don't expect much from me. They turned down my offer to give them allowance but I still do it every month. They don't know I have been jobless for some time now. My parents divorced when I was younger and then my mom remarried so we seldom meet. My dad's job requires a lot of travelling so I don't get to see him much.

The only person who knows I'm jobless is my fiance. We're getting married next year. He has always been there for me for the past seven years. Although he's a super smart guy who earns five digit a month, he's very humble and down to earth. Our dates were mostly watching movies and eating at food courts.

He came from a broken family that struggled with poverty so he's very thankful for my support over the years, like buying him meals, clothes and necessities when we were students. Now that I'm jobless, he would always tell me not to worry about anything and assure me that he will take care of me.

The problem now is he would always insist on paying for all my expenses. He would also insist on giving me 20% of his pay every month. I always tell him I have a lot of savings and don't need his money but he would still transfer me his money. He also gave me a supplementary card and asked me to use it freely.

I feel super touched by the things he's done for me and I'm really thankful for having him in my life but I'm just wondering if it's wrong to take his money and whether it's okay to take a long break from work. More importantly, will my parents be okay with what I'm doing? Should I tell them the truth?

However lately, she started getting paranoid about lying after seeing some of her cousins’ relationships wrecked because of lying. She even demanded that whoever caught lying in our relationship will be fined by the other person. To reassure her, I agreed.

Then for some ridiculous reasons, she started fining me a few times for “lying”. The most ridiculous fine was when I blurted out during an argument that she spent more time meeting her good guy friends than meeting me. She said I was lying because I didn’t take into account the other time she spent thinking about me but choosing to compare only the time physically meeting. 

I was incensed and demanded that she give me a breakdown on how much time she spent thinking about her good guy friends compared to that spent thinking about me. At this point she said she can give me the breakdown, but she counter-questioned me about my intentions for asking and implied that I don’t trust her even though she always has my back blah blah blah. She still refuses to give the breakdown. 

Should I get out of this relationship? I know I probably still have value on the dating market because some other girl has persistently pursued me (but she has money management issues). But after all, my gf and I have been together for some time and we are familiar with each other.

208,"I see many people recommending volunteering to meet new people etc. But honestly I personally cannot fathom how people can like, voluntarily do volunteer work (if that makes sense), because my volunteering experience in school from CIP has totally made these activities feel repulsive. Being forced to go for these CIP activities and having a quota to reach is already bad enough, but what makes it worse is the actual volunteering experience. For example, in old folks' homes and nursing homes, you have to somehow interact with all these old and sick people; the extreme awkwardness is one thing, but another thing is that you know that their physical suffering is definitely not going to be reduced by simply having volunteers there and it just makes you feel so helpless. Then there's the kind of volunteering that is just saikang, like cleaning stuff and house painting. For house painting, I had a personal experience where the person whose house we were painting clearly wanted us to stop and kept telling us nicely that the painting looks ok and we have painted enough. It clearly feels like we are just wrecking her house and looking at our slipshod paint job (cos we aren't professional painters after all) only emphasises this feeling.

Just that one key area I am concerned about is that the technical skills I am learning at work are probably the ones I have already learnt in school. So a word of advice from everyone, is it normal for your work to be relatively like what I have done in school already? Or is this a sign I should be getting a new job to learn more stuff?

212,"Hi, I need some advice on my relationship. I feel like breaking up with my girlfriend. My girlfriend and I have been together for a little over six months. Before we got attached, everything was sweet and lovely. However, once we got together, I felt that I am being controlled and watched. 

Anything that I am doing, Anywhere that I am going, Where am I currently, Who I am with, I have to report it to her. Things get worst when she does not approve of the activities that I am doing. She does not like me playing mahjong cause her father was an addict, and shes afraid of me being one. Note here, I have only played mahjong as a fun and chill game. Not gamble. We ended up fighting because of that. 

Going to the gym can be difficult as she thinks that I will look at all the females there when I am exercising. She does not like me hanging out with girls (even girls that are attached), for fear that I might betray her. Sometimes, I am only hanging out with guys, and she isn’t happy about it. I have never cheated on her, and I only have eyes for her. When we talk about this topic, she claims that she is sensitive and insecure, but can’t she just trust me? 

I’m always paying for her share and buying her gifts. Why? As a china national, she claims that the guy must give gifts to the female every now and then as it is a “china thing.” Heck, I even had to buy a phone for her. My poor wallet.

There are many other more situations but I hope to keep this post short. I really do love her, but her insecurities and sensitivity are making our relationship difficult. Having fights everyday, it is really tiring. Help.

214,"Dear Prof Ben and NUSWhispers community,

TLDR; Girl I like seemed to like me back during school term. Ghosted me during vacation. I don't think she's the kind that would use me but who knows. I want to continue whatever we had. Might be awkward if I want but she doesn't. I'm lost... How should I treat her or go about this tactfully? Even just as friends? 

There's this girl that I really like and have been helping her for homework during the semester. We were very close. She was not rejecting my romantic advances, and sometimes even reciprocating. It seemed mutual. I thought we had a thing but it turns out she just completely ghosted me during the vacation. 

We were so close during the semester. I don't understand why she ghosted me. But maybe something happened or maybe she's just not in the mood? To be fair it could have been something I did that made her decide I don't want this guy. Looking back I realise I haven't really showed her feel loved in the way she wanted despite her hints. Maybe I should be understanding and give her the benefit of doubt. She seemed very genuine during the semester. Not like the kind of girl with a motive. 

But right now when I try to talk to her she'll seem cold and uninterested. We used to talk every day. Now she's not initiating convos and when I do, she'll give me one word replies. She seems like she doesn't want this anymore.

Sometimes it makes me feel like I'm just being annoying and I trying to talk to her is just pestering her. It feels stupid trying to talk to her when she doesn't want to talk. I don't know what happened or if it's something I did wrong. 

There'll prob be a lot of comments telling me to 'ditch her, u just got used' and everything but please don't. 

I still want this relationship (or friendship) and I treasure her as a person. I like her a lot. and there's the possibility that she's just going through something. I just don't want to assume that this is over cause it might not be. 

Right now, I don't know how to continue this 'relationship'. It's hard to continue when the other person is making it feel 'one-way' even tho it used not be. And it's hard to let her know how I feel or ask her directly since we are not exactly boyfriend girlfriend. I just hope that this is a misunderstanding and it'll all work out eventually. What should I do? How should I continue treating her? How do I get things to be like the way it used to

216,"22 Male here.
I broke up a few months ago with my girlfriend of 6 months. It was me who broke it off knowing she wasn't the right person for me in the long run (it started getting too serious too soon). Her bestfriend somehow got into middle of this and confessed his love for her. I tried to give her space to figure things out but eventually decided that it wasn't worth it and broke up with her.
It was an ugly breakup even though I tried to keep it very straightforward. 
We blocked each other almost everywhere. However, now I know for a fact that both of them are together and it boils my blood. 
They jumped into the relationship just right after we broke up even though she used to tell me she never looked at him that way and never imagined being together with him. 
I would have been fine with it if it was someone else but knowing that she is with the guy who was somewhat a reason for our breakup makes me really mad. I keep getting these wild thoughts to ruin their relationship in some way or the other. 
I feel guilty for feeling that way. I thought I had moved on but the fact that it still bothers me knowing they are together, sleeping together says otherwise.
Obviously it must have been very easy for her to move on jumping from one relationship to other but it has been somewhat hard for me. 
I'm well surrounded with loving friends and family. Also I keep myself busy for most days with work. But the nights are the hardest. 

I keep switching to another IG account I created where I am following her to check her and that guy's post or stories. I know I should delete that account and try to move on but I just can't get myself to do it. 

Can someone share some advice. I really want to move on and leave both of them in the past.

223,"#74749:  

TLDR: Try to fix first but please leave if it doesn't work out.

I agree that the past generation tend to stay in relationships longer and the rate of divorce these days is definitely higher in comparison. But keep in mind that people might stay in relationships for different reasons back then. For eg, I've a few uncles who are substance abusers (alcohol, smoking, you name it) and honestly the wives are only staying because they are housewives and will lose all they have if they leave. So yes couples stay with each other longer but are they really happy? This is probably a question that only they can answer. 

What's the point of writing this? The point is that I'm seeing way too many instances whereby couples stay in relationships because of fb/ig posts about how you should ""never stop trying"" and ""stick through it all because your partner is worth more than that"". Broken relationships end up dragging for months and even years before the eventual break and by then both parties are worn out and there's no longer any affection left - only resentment. So then when outsiders lament that ""it's a pity that such a long-term relationship ended just like that"" the fact is that it has ended a long time ago. Of course there are those who on the other hand give up too easily but we need to realise that both groups are equally problematic.  

Like you said, we are all work in progress and sometimes we really are oblivious to the pain that we are causing to our partners. To this, I raise having better communication and healthy arguments instead of the focus on fixing. The obsession with fixing hints that everything can indeed be mended which is untrue because sometimes, you really can't fix what's already broken.

226,"Hi, I need some advice. I’ve been using Tinder for some time now but I’ve never had the courage to meet up with any of the guys that asked me out. I will always try to avoid meeting up or just reject them even after talking to them for a few months. I have this fear of awkwardness or just me looking weird and feeling very self-conscious. I am an evergreen and I’ve never experienced how it feels like to be dating so there are temptations to meet up with one but then I’ll fall back into the fear and reject them and after a while they just get tired of me and stop talking. This has been going on for about a year. Then I stopped using Tinder for a year and I downloaded it again recently. So I matched with this guy that looked pretty cute and he asked me out but we didn’t talk much and I don’t know much about him. But he’s cute and I’ve seen his Instagram and he types in a cute way too. I don’t know if I should meet up with him? Sometimes I feel shallow for using the app because it’s all about looks, and I’m someone that treasures friendship so if things don’t work out I’ll feel sad and empty for a while and I don’t know if I’m ready for those. But then I’m also like why not just try right, but I’ll look in the mirror and see how ugly I am and feel like no one’s gonna accept that T.T But then I also want to try to date :( I’ve thought of just deleting the app and focus on myself and not care about wanting to date but the thoughts come back sometimes. I honestly really prefer the old school way of dating, like starting from knowing each other in real life, to friends, to close friends and then like each other and progress but there’s no one around me that’s available. I don’t know what I should do. I’m 20 by the way.

But in the past, what our parents or grandparents learnt is how to fix it, rather than just throw it away and 'buy' a new relationship. If you have been approaching it wrong, it shouldn't be 'you don't deserve him or her', but 'let's work and see how you can change'. We are all work in progress, and the same goes for our partners.

Last month I held a christmas party at my place and invited some friends over. We had dinner, did gift exchange and played some drinking games. Three friends (one guy and two girls) decided to crash at my place since my parents were overseas. 

While the rest had gone home, the four of us continued with the games. We got so drunk that we fell asleep on the floor and couch. I woke up in the middle of the night to pee and then went back to my room. 

I saw that one of the girls was sitting on my bed, drunk texting on her phone, looking troubled. I asked her why she looks so sad. She then told me about her problems at home and that she was going through a difficult time in her life. 

I tried to listen to her and give her some advice. She asked me if she could hug me. So I let her hug me and told her that I will sleep in the living room. But she begged me to not leave her alone. So I sat on the edge of the bed. 

She then asked me if I could lie down beside her for awhile. So I did. She suddenly got up and sat on me. She started kissing me and then taking off my shorts and underwear. She then forced herself on me. I didn't resist although I didn't enjoy it. 

I guess I wanted it because I was deprived for a long time. 3 years to be exact. I met my gf a year after I broke up with my ex and we have been together for 2 years. 

We have stable careers and our rs has been great. But she would always turn me down whenever I suggest something intimate. She says she doesn't want any 'accident' to happen as she has no intention of getting married in the next 3 to 5 years. 

I respect her wishes so I would just back off whenever she turns me down. But I've always craved for more than just hugs and kisses. I know I have made a terrible mistake and I feel so miserable now. I have apologised to that friend of mine and have been trying to avoid her ever since that day.

Firstly, the job isn't related to my studies (science related background). Being a contract worker who wanted a conversion to a permanent position, I worked hard everyday. My superior and colleagues acknowledged and appreciated the effort that I have put in at work. The good working environment and friendly colleagues are some of the good factors that I will missed if I were to leave my current job for another job that is related to my studies.

However, the huge workload that I faced everyday is something that I dreaded. I have to OT till late at night often and though the salary was not too bad, I felt tired easily. I told myself that burnout cannot be happening to me since I am only less than a year in my current role, and I adjusted to my role like within 1 month easily, but the truth is, working at my role isn't something a lot of people will find it easy to adjust to due to its atypical working hours (start late, end even later).

I have another 6 months to go before my contract is up for renewal. I  do worry about my job security as when cutting down of budget is required, contract workers like me are going to be the first to go. My dream of continuing as a permanent staff to enjoy better job security and benefits maybe vanished. 

Pros of continuing at my current role that I have foresee: higher pay if I continue, good working environment, able to learn more things related to the industry, use the free time away from work to do my own stuff

Cons of continuing at my current role : Not able to apply whatever I have learnt from my studies (I have wanted to work in a science related environment such as lab analyst), body clock screwed up completely (shift work), regular office hours may be something that I prefer(?)

241,"TLDR: should I be accepting a persistent guy whose looks I'm not attracted to, but his care and concern is what touched me? but important thing to bear in mind is that I have rejected him before. but he somehow touched me overtime, and he kept persisting.

Here's a super long story (I warned, I posted TLDR right at the start). Just a little background story. I'm a girl, evergreen, never been in a r/s, and this story consist of two guys. And all these interaction with them are of online context. Before you groan and do the ""omg get out there"" stuff, I do get out there, but like most other stories had recurred, it's not as easy as you think. It's hard for us working adults, and I'm shy on top of being an introvert as well.

Guy A is someone I know through an online game. He's smart, witty, and charismatic. You must be wondering how I conclude that. Former two being his replies to others, even when people try to put him down his response are always calm and above them, with a tinge of sarcasm that immediately put the hostile opponent down. Charismatic, he's a leader in our game and people look up to him. One thing about him though, because he has so much to handle, he typically showed no interest to most people.

I liked A but here's the bomb, A is married. So I have never expressed anything out of the slightest. I invested alot, though. I can drop my schedules if he need me; Even if I'm tired I made myself do it cos he need it; I send him bday packages (overseas yea) for two years now. Oversea gifts are expensive due to postage/shipping but I do it anyway. Love is blind, or so I thought it was. I can't even exactly pinpoint why I liked him. I guess I liked someone who is kinda ""cold"". Makes me have the protective instinct and feel that everyone have a good in them that will show when showed warmth.

I started a new game with A and that's where we know B from. B is pretty high flier in it, everyone is in awe of him. B knew me through A, and had joked asking if I wanted to join his ""harem"", I said no flat out since I still like A. However, from then, B made it a mission to win me over. He had told me after that he had never been rejected before and it stings, he want to revenge by making fall for him. Despite our whole guild including him know I tend towards A because I always showed I like A in banters and all. So I had never treated B serious, cos I dislike being played and I felt he wasn't serious about, it was just an ""achievement"" thing for him.

I subsequently rejected him a few more times when he asked (staggered of course, not at once). Oh, and this game has marriage, whenever he ask me I reject, he marry one, but they never last long lol. Because he marry them in name but was never with them, he's always hanging around me. The funny thing is, this ""mission"" of his never cease even after more than 6 months. And eventually he confessed that he like me and maybe beyond. And it happened only after awhile, since initially it wasn't so. 

Something I failed to mention, is that A personality got more and more worse overtime. I mean, I knew he was this way, but since I liked him I always made excuse for his behaviour and allow him to degrade me. But the existence of B made me realize how badly I was treated (and I had continue to allow it after all this while). B was always there for me, interested to know my thoughts, my feelings (and that's what matters to me), and never degrades me the way A does. A is what you call a typical narcissist. When he was in fault he will twist it to my fault, it's never his fault. I usually just say sorry and accept it. He never says sorry. 

B often ask why I allow A to be such a d!ck to myself. Because it's apparent in the way A talk to me, and I often laugh it off or bicker back, which everyone see it as playful banter. Sometimes it is, but really, I felt terribly sad sometimes. I began to talk more to B rather than A, and I love the way I am treated as someone important, or at least, a human being. But that's the thing, I like the way I was treated, but I wasn't attracted to his looks (I know how he looks like but he doesn't know how I look like yet). He, however, always constantly tell me he like/love me. So I was conflicted whether to bring it further. I didn't want to short-change him or anything, like whether do I really like him or it's just his care and concern that I like.

This post is too long in fact, I can go on and on about it since I kept this bottled up, my friends dk about this. Sorry for this long post. I actually deliberated for 2 weeks whether I want advice from others, and that it's too complicated to type out in details, but decide to in the end, since I would be meeting him in less than a month time for the first time, and it's pretty nerves-wrecking. I'm not sure anyone has ever been in such situation, anyone can relate? Or anyone with more past experiences/interactions, would appreciate some advice if possible :( 

TLDR: should I be accepting a persistent guy whose looks I'm not attracted to, but his care and concern is what touched me? but important thing to bear in mind is that I have rejected him before. but he somehow touched me overtime, and he kept persisting.

254,"Hi #74635, I understand how you feel. Some years ago, I also had two suitors. The first guy is husband material. The second guy is more like boyfriend material.

I saw that both had their own merits and struggled for a very long time to make a decision. Both were very serious in me and I had feelings for both.

Eventually I chose the husband material guy because he was like so perfect. We dated for awhile and everything was great. But whenever he brings up topics on marriage, I would feel uneasy. Then I realised that I don't love him. I only liked the idea of dating a perfect guy. So I broke up with him. 

After breaking up, the boyfriend material guy continued to woo me. I got moved by his efforts and decided to date him. He's a very smart and interesting guy but after some time, I found out that we were incompatible. So I broke up with him.

In the end, I gave up on both guys because I realised I've never loved any of them. If I had loved the husband material guy, I wouldn't have been so scared of marrying him. If I had loved the boyfriend material guy, I wouldn't have given up on him so easily. But most importantly, if I had loved anyone of them, I wouldn't have struggled to make a decision. 

Some time later, the same situation happened again, two suitors at the same time. Both were equally sincere and eligible. But somehow I was very sure who I want to be with and who I want to remain friends with. The moment one of them confessed, I quickly rejected. The other one that I didn't reject is now my fiance. 

I guess if you love someone, you won't even consider dating another person. And you can see yourself spending your life with this person and you can't imagine losing him. 

If you can't decide who to choose, you probably don't love anyone of them and shouldn't choose any of them. You should choose the person whom you should love most - yourself. Choose to love yourself first. Love yourself enough to work on yourself, be the best version of yourself. 

Love yourself enough to not want to settle for a guy who is not enough for you. Husband material, so what? No matter how perfect this person is, he will never be enough if you don't love him. If he can't make you forget about other guys then he's not the one for you.

He does things for me like send me home, listen to my problems if I have any and makes time for me despite being very busy. He shows me what he is doing usually so I will rule out the possibility that he is cheating. Anyway he seems very emotionally distant. For example, when I am down he doesn’t pay attention unless I ask for it, if I’m sick he does not do anything other than send me a message, and he only makes time for me because I asked for it or listen to my problems only if I ask for it. So basically he only does things if I ask for it... and when he meet ups with me he is not excited for it. Every single time I talk to him about this, he will say that he is already putting in effort like send me back (which is actually because it’s on the way) but due to that I will not comment further because it is true that he sent me back. Is it normal to be emotionally distant but yet still like a person? We have been dating for around 8 months, could this be the reason? He also admitted being a not so emotional person, do such people exists? Can someone please explain what does this mean? Please do not be mean haha I’m genuinely asking.

263,"Yesterday, I dreamt of a guy that was going out with me. I was really happy, really really happy. But I woke up. I realised it was all a dream. I sat on my bed, looking back at how far I've come.

In primary school, people called me all sorts of names e.g. ahgua, guniang, sissy etc just because of my more feminine moves. I brushed all of that off because I know all their opinions were not important as I am who I am. 

As I start to mature, I started to realise I am interested in both male and female. Whenever I am walking on the streets, I would be checking people from both genders out. I would be stealing a glance at them and thinking how good would it be if I could also get a partner just like them, be in love etc. 

As I grow up in a conservative family, I am unable to voice out or to vent my frustrations at people, not even my friends. I have never told anyone about my sexual preferences. Even I, as the owner of this body, denied the fact that I am actually a bisexual. I cheated myself into believing that I am straight, and this constant suppression of desires had myself depressed and really introverted during my teenage years. However, deep down I know I am actually a bisexual. I would then cry myself into sleep, wondering why am I different from what the society perceived a male should like.  

As I enter poly, I met more people. I see people from all walks of life, be it straight, bisexual, homosexual etc. And I remember it was one fine day, on my way to school, a thought came across my mind. If I intend to keep my sexual preference as a secret forever, and if I continue to deny the fact that I am a bisexual, isn't it very pathetic as you don't even recognise and acknowledge yourself for who you really are? Because if you don't even accept for who you are, how are you expecting other people to accept who you are too should you tell them about your sexual preferences in the future? From then on, I start to accept myself for who I am and I am happier and contented with life since.

Although I still don't have a partner as of now to adore me, at least I appreciate who I am, and I love myself more as compared to the past. 

I just wanted to share my story. I hope to let everyone knows that there is this group of people in LGBT society who are still suffering internally. Not because of how you think of them, but how they think of themselves. Just because society sets the standards and all of us believes in it, this group of people just follow blindly and thought the standards was ""right"", thinking that the outliers (like them) were ""wrong"". Truth is, society isn't always right. Only if we could all think deeper, be a little compassionate and stand from a different viewpoint. Maybe, just maybe, the world would be a nicer place.

267,"Would love to hear your opinions/ advice for this issue. I have been crushing on this guy hard since two years ago. We were from the same CCA in JC and we got pretty close (people assumed we were together). I felt that he liked me too back then, but probably didn't ask me out as it was a bad timing: A levels coming up, and he's going to be in the Army while I'm in uni. We still keep in touch and meet up a few times a year.

I've tried to move on, but even after meeting so many people in uni, he's still the only one I will consider as a bf. He is joining NUS next sem, and he said he'd join the same CCA as me again! The problem is that he doesn't seem that interested in me anymore. Recently he had been treating me as a senior, like he is more polite than he was before, and our conversations are mostly about uni life. I tried being friendlier but he sort of put up a ""junior/ senior barrier""? What is going on?? We're the same age so I really don't understand why he's being like that. We also meet up less often now, even though he has more free time. He's still single and has complained to me before about how hard it is to meet new people to find a potential gf. 

I don't want to confess out of the blue as that would probably put him on the spot, as he doesn't ""see me as a girl"" now. How do I let him at least consider me as an option? I've been dressing up nicely when we go out, we would sort of flirt over text but he thinks I'm joking and he'd flirt back jokingly as well. I know I'm quite deep in the friendzone here, but what can I do? I wouldn't mind confessing out of the blue, even risking our friendship. My crush on him is really draining, and has been preventing me from potentially finding a bf. I just wish to have a closure to this, and I want to give it a shot.

269,"I recently met this guy on cmb about 3 weeks ago. We have been texting to and fro everyday, though not actively - about <10 messages daily. Thus far, our convo is centred mostly on our daily lives and some random stuff, which is ok. But recently, I realized that the convo is focusing more on me only (as in he would ask me about stuff and I would answer, and this goes on and on).

He admitted that he is an introvert and a very slow texter (takes many hours to reply) - which I'm completely fine with and I choose to believe his words.

But I'm just wondering if he is at least a little interested in me (hence he still keeps the convo going even with the not-so-active/delayed responses), or am I like just a side option to him (maybe as a chat buddy)? Thus far, I have a relatively positive impression of him, and it seems like he is quite honest and upright (general impression I get through texts). Do you guys see a future in this relationship? Or is it still too early to tell? If yes, what should I do to continue this? If not, then maybe I should just stop the conversation once and for all.

I've always had a general impression that ppl on dating sites show their preferences quite quickly (like they will stop the convo if they are not interested), but this is something different so I'm unsure what to do.

Honest opinions much appreciated, thanks!

So I met this person T during one of the exchange briefings and we agreed to rent a house in Melbourne together. He wanted this expensive apartment with 1 big (1 double bed) and 1 small bedroom (1 single bed). I was a bit reluctant but agreed anyway. At first we agreed to split the money equally without deciding who stays in which room. However at the back of my head I was thinking about the difference in bedroom sizes as there’s a huge difference. 

So I decided to discuss with him about who stays in which room. He wanted the big bedroom but I told him we are paying the same amount and the one staying in the bigger room should pay more. He said that I’m calculative and taking advantage of him. Then I asked if he would be ok if I got the bigger room instead and paying the same amount. He begun to scold me about how he didn’t want to stay with me, I should be grateful to him, how we already agreed to pay the same amount etc (but not who stays in which room).

I've met people who used me, played me, and being overly desperate beings (too nice to me),  yet still feel like I couldn't find anyone better than my ex. But I didn't wanna patch back because I felt like we were toxic and I became the worst version of me. 

We both had quite a bad temper and low tolerance in general. Whenever one flared, we would ended up quarreling. I don't see myself growing to be a better person in terms of patience. And I really want a patient person who will not flare up over minor things, and will influence me to be more patient as well.  

However, it made me more wary of love, such that I would want to be more understanding towards my next partner, address whatever issues we have as a mature adult, and help each other grow into the best version of ourselves.

Instead of cutting him out, I just felt like doing the same back to him. I know it's awful and unhealthy to live this way, but is it normal to feel so angry getting played? I know it probably won't hurt him if I do back the same but I just want him to feel played at some point too.

289,"Hi I need some advice here. I have broken up with my first gf of 4 years and on rare times, I still find myself thinking about her even though we had broken up for about 2 years now and I have had 2 relationships since then (all lasted about 3-4 months). She was the first for everything (kiss, holding hands, meeting my parents, sex, we even went to see a house tgt) and the first woman that I ever thought of marrying and she has been with me through my most difficult times (NS, JC, and university). 

I will give you a little backstory before asking for the actual advice so bear with me. 

I got into a relationship pretty late at about 20 years old. The love we got for each other was pure. So pure that it is almost selfless. Our honeymoon period lasted all the way until I had to leave overseas for a work trip of 1 year. We were madly in love so we thought we could pull through but we ended breaking up because we were bad at communicating when I was overseas and time difference and distance just made everything a lot harder to rectify. I wanted to work things out when I am back but I think she already made the decision long ago and was dead set on breaking up with me and I couldn't change her mind. 

This left a dent in my heart. She being my first love and lasting for 4 years to the point that we were planning our marriage crushed me. I became so much more wary of love. I dated 2 other girls after her in the past two years and the feeling was so different. 

The first girl that I dated after my ex made me realise that I am less selfless and more wary in love. She was a nice girl but we were both fresh out of a long 4 years relationship which was kinda a recipe for disaster. Needless to say, we didn't work out. 

The second girl that I dated crushed my self-esteem. Her ex was a really rich guy and she is one who enjoys an expensive gift. She is not a gold digger because she buys me equally expensive gifts. it's just that her lifestyle was hard to keep up. Her parents also kinda picked on my background/ status which made me questioned my self-worth. 

All these failures in the relationship made me feel like maybe It's my own problems. Maybe I am not worthy of love. idk. 

I want to ask advice from someone who maybe had a similar experience - breaking up with someone they love for 4 years or more. How did you recover from that? I find myself unable to give the same kind of selfless and unconditional love similar to the one that I gave my first and it worries me. How can I love selflessly again?

304,"For all the CS freshmen wondering if they should go for CS2040S, here's my 2 cents: You should take CS2040S and CS2030. If you think your workload is too high, delay CS2100 first then take in next sem under Prof Uncle Soo (an amazing lecturer). 
CS2105 now requires CS2040S, so your situation is different from your seniors. For your seniors, they could take CS2040S, CS2105, CS2106 (<- these are core mods btw), and other non-core modules like CS2107 in Y2S1, so delaying CS2040S doesn't really hurt progression of CS modules.  Now, you guys have one less module to take in Y2S1 so I wouldn't delay CS2040S if I were you, cos you'll need CS2040S for CS2103T too.
Btw, CS2030 and CS2040S are both in Java. So your workload is technically lessened by taking both mods together (profit).
Some of your seniors delayed CS2040S because Prof Harold (another awesome lecturer) teaches more topics and teaches them really well in Sem 1. This year though, the Profs are equally fantastic for CS2040S in Sem 2, so I'd simply take CS2040S without a second thought. I think most of your seniors would agree. 
Anyway, this is just some info to help u make your judgement, seniors pls add in if I missed out anything

I kind of struggle to find link to what mechanical engineering students do in the working world. I chose engineering in poly because I thought that, that was the course that I will do most well. (I did pretty well in EEE too, as I was in common engineering program)
I like both EEE and mechanical engineering on theory, I don't find it to a torture to study it, it's not that I have no interest in it but I kind of don't understand what I will do in the future and if I should study this course.. Idk how to phase it.. 

My understanding is that many people don't really work in the same field? (I find quite irony and I also shouldn't aim for that because wouldn't that be a waste of time but also, I realised that we also study other module and etc.. So it doesn't make sense to be constraint to one industry just because we are mechanical engineering. I alao seem to have the perception that mechanical engineering is like an absolete course? (no offence).

On the curiosity side, I wonder why so many mechanical engineering and EEE students are accepted as compare to other course?

It has almost been a year since i first saw you. I've always looked forward to seeing you around. Whenever our eyes inadvertently met, i couldn't help but to look away, being the helplessly shy person i am when it comes to you.

It has almost been a year and yet we seem no more than strangers; no more than the familiar face we see every time without significance. Of course, how else could it be? Every ounce of my courage drained away upon seeing you. I've missed countless opportunities to approach you, for fear that you won't feel the same. Sometimes my friends are around and i couldn't pick up the courage at all. 

It has almost been a year and yet i still become flustered when our eyes met. Work is starting for me and i'm afraid i won't be able to see you again. There's no time left and i don't want to miss anymore chances. In this new year, i pray that i will have the courage to approach you, just once without fear even if it is bound to fail.

334,"Long post ahead. Just needed to rant and seek some advice.
I have this girlfriend clique from long ago. We’ve been together for more than a decade already.  I sincerely missed those days when all of us were still single ladies, where we would often arrange meetups for dinner and would treasure each others company. 

Now the problem comes when over the years, with each girlfriend finally finding a partner, I realised that all their attitude started to change. Now, don’t get me wrong, I am not jealous or anything, in fact I am truly happy for my friends who finally found a soulmate. From the bottom of my heart. Really. But what truly irks me is that the ones who are attached starts to slowly drift away from the clique, and often doing things that neglect the feelings of their girlfriends. Eg the clique has forever been planning to go for a short trip; to batam lets say, cos we havent had a chance to do so since we’ve been together. Then this one girlfriend can say “huh no $”, only to fly off to Japan with her boyfriend couple of months later. 

Then, there’s this other girlfriend. Before any of us dated, the clique has never emphasized so much on budget whenever we meet for dinner and to celebrate each others birthday. We just eat whatever we wanted to, cos what’s most important were the company we had back then. Now, whenever we do plan a dinner date/mini birthday celebration, people be like “budget please”.  Whats worse, when you see their insta story and they be like dining like queens with their boyfriends every other day (or sometimes every day). When its the clique’s turn to meet up once every 2/3 months, it becomes a budgeted affair. So now what, your decade long girlfriends become your budgeted friends already lah. Can eat good food with boyfriend all the time, but girlfriends not worth the time and penny to eat good food with?? Plus, we always plan a month or two ahead the birthday or dinner date, and people always gives excuses of being busy and all, it’s so darn hard to fix a date that everyone can make it. 

And then, every night (i swear) after work she’s having dinner with  her boyfriend  -.-  as seen from her insta story. THIS i cannot understand. 

To fellow girls, is this common in girl cliques or is it just mine. Why the need for double-standard, is it that difficult to prioritize both clique and boyfriend without upsetting either parties? Or is it that a decade long friendship means nothing to them anymore once they had a partner. Ain’t it like like burning bridges with friends who truly stood by their side since the beginning, long before that boyfriend of theirs existed??? To that, I always feel very sad and disappointed with these girlfriends. Is it right for me to go tell them out about their behaviour??

Was fed up and asked the security only to my dismay that nothing was return to the security. After rationalizing, I suspect that someone might have stolen it.

340,"Hi, 

There’s this guy who got me a present for Christmas (jewellery), which was really sweet. We just hanged out but I didn’t get him anything, and I’m feeling that I should have been more thoughtful. Since also, vday is coming, so I am thinking of getting him something this time.

But it is really hard to find gifts for guys... Would appreciate if I could get some suggestions? Maybe around $50? Ok to be less, also ok to stretch a bit more.

So guys, if you could help, what would be a nice present to receive from a girl? 

He is sporty and speaks very well. (No cooking or staying at his place, please. Chocolates might be a bit cliche...)

Some context: We are colleagues and recently expressed that we like each other but for personal reasons we are not together and will not be. He says he will continue to care for me so I really want to thank him for everything and let him know that I appreciate him :)

He's in his late twenties, tall, good looking, smart, witty, has a great career. He would text me throughout the day despite his busy schedules.

One day he asked me if I would like to go out with him but I rejected him. He tried to convince me that I should go out with him. He said he likes me and can tell that I like him too, which is actually true. I like him because he's a good listener and he makes time for me and we like talking to each other alot. But I don't know why I felt like this is too good to be true? I'm just an average girl but he's so perfect. Is it stupid of me to not want to go out with someone so perfect? I still cannot believe that he likes me. I feel like even if we start dating, things won't last because he's just too good for me. But I feel really sad for rejecting him and ignoring him ever since. Sigh.. what should I do? Is there anyone out there who is scared of being with someone too perfect??

I've always had this deep interest in engineering. From young I would build many LEGO sets and have many imaginary adventures with my brother. As I grew older, however, I realized that I am unable to apply this imagination to my engineering course here at NUS. I have consulted my older sister about this many times, but she always blames it on my inability to let go of my idealistic ways from the past, plus she's too busy with her boyfriend to care. All throughout my teenage years I've thought I could make the world a better place with my inventions, but I guess the Tri-State area will never accept me for who I am.

My gf later found out about it and was livid! She said that it was very disrespectful and that I should have asked or informed her first. I didn't think that was necessary because 1) I knew she wouldn't go, 2) she knew all of them and 3) it was no different from hanging out outside. I was just leveraging on a free venue to save costs.

Ever since I got a bf and he pointed it out I've been feeling like I should get rid of it but the treatment and surgeries are expensive and I honestly do not know what to do

In Y1, I fell in love with the beaches here in SG (especially Sentosa), and I had two friends who were siblings (brother and sister) who always accompanied me to the beach. The carefree times playing in the water are times I look back fondly upon. These friends also defended me when I was targeted unfairly by a jealous student who said that he had to beat me at all my modules (I really didn't understand his deal but ok).

In Y2, I met this tough girl who was uncompromising but loyal, yet she also had a difficult past in terms of her parents being overprotective over her. She helped me in one particularly difficult Geography Module that I had to take. This was also the period where I started to develop feelings for one of the siblings, though I was too afraid to tell her.

In Y3, The jealous student turned out to be misunderstood the whole time as it was actually his father who set him on this wrong path. He had a deep interest in cooking, and I learnt a lot of good recipes from him (he also taught me dancing).

Finally in Y4, I was able to graduate with a decent CAP and defeat the Firelord when the comet came.

Also, he can't get ""it"" up.. so we have never done much in the bedroom even after a few overseas trips and staycations together. Should I keep trying or should I give up?

In the past, she never complains much, never whines about having to work night shifts to make financial ends meet. It was super difficult to see her in school, because she was always busy with work or had to stay at home to recover from her frequent sickness. Every time we meet up, she will always have a smile on her face as she gently encourage me to look on the brighter side whenever i rant to her about my trivial problems.

I have know this girl, A, since university days, and besides her less than ideal (would say around 4/10) face and figure, she has a great personality.

When we go out for dinner, she doesn't mind eating at the same place even though we have eaten at the same place just a couple of weeks ago. She knew that I fancied a K-Pop girl group and when she went overseas for vacation, she helped to purchase a merchandise of that girl group, and I was very surprised and touched by her action. 

She had a carefree outlook towards things in general, and shares  characteristics as me (sharing about books that we read, learning new things together, visiting libraries and bookstores, travel etc).
Despite her busy work schedule and colleagues who are not that good, she doesn't complain too much about work and takes things in her stride.

Recently, I have even picked up a new sport (tennis) that was foreign to me, and she was so patient in teaching me the basics of it. I truly enjoyed the time spent with her, and can't wait to see her again soon for more tennis. The thing is, when I went home, many different thoughts linger in my mind, and one of it was to advancing the friendship to a further relationship with her, while another opposing thought was that since she looked like what people would called as 'dinobu' , I myself have qualms about going further with her.

Sad to say, when I looked at the female friends around me who are single, I am ashamed to say that because of the high requirements that I have, (skinny and tall, great personality, caring etc), I am still single. It's going to be the end of 2019, and my mum would harp on the fact that people of my age (25)are already becoming parents. I would not want to get into a relationship just because of peer pressure, but seeing people around me are in relationships made me felt worse, and social media made it worse.

I am thankful that A is there to provide a supportive ear for me when I need it, such as career choice, assignment support back in university and so on. She would be someone whom I would say fits the bill of someone worth marrying because of her values and personality, but I am still having doubts about myself.

I don't have time to do part time to occupy myself so I find that on days I'm not out/overseas I'm just nua-ing at home.

Long story short- i met a guy who constantly gave me mixed signals. He has a broken childhood as well, his dad was a pilot and wasnt there for him growing up and even sent him away to live with his uncle. We fought a lot (even crashed a transport together). he always keep asking for my hand but i always rejected him. 

Recently i vanquished my grandfather and the boy ghosted me for good. I got so pissed that i went away and took up his uncle's surname to spite him. 

Now all i need is advice on how to retrieve my lightsabre from the hole i dug with my mind.

If you marry at 40s, there is plenty of time for you to enjoy and you’ll be much more financially stable and matured. Unlike girls, guys also don’t have a biological clock.

My dad was close to being a multi-millionaire only 2 years back until fate threw itself at him and his organization got acquired in a ruthless takeover. Needless to say, nearly everyone got laid off and him, being noble in his ways, was left last man standing in sg offices and revolted against his staff being laid off. As a result, he lost his job and decided to start his own venture. It has been almost 2 years since and he's gone ALL IN into his business, selling the properties, assets and whatnot. We were close to selling the fucking car this year. Why he lost all the money and hasn't made any back is a whole different fuckery for a diff time. (Pisses me off) There are leads into investments from VCs etc but as of this moment, nothing is confirmed.
It's a very tough time for my family since obv we all depend on it. And when it comes to me, I'm still doing my bachelors and doing part-time gigs to make my walkaround money and it fucking enrages me to my bones that I'm unable to do much for his business financially. (He needs major funding obv). I help him out in my own little ways as much as I can (its a tech startup) and I have even offered to pitch to VCs for him but he's the kinda dad who trusts all over his own kin. (Mixing business & family is always a bad idea). We're gonna go bust soon if we do not get funded soon and all of this is fucking with my head. I'm always angry & aggressive, taking it out on other ppl and I'm worried I'll lose my shit soon.
I have tried just being into my own shit and letting him handle his business, but he's a noble man and a bad businessman. He's too nice and people including his employeed take advantage of him. 
I'm worried. If anyone out there resonates with all this, please go ahead and share. I'm slowly losing my  shit.

393,"Hi guys, I'm currently in a ldr; my girlfriend doing her preU studies in London, while I'm a y2 student from NUS. We have been together for 4 years and this ldr thing has begun in Sept 2019. Both of us has gotten used to it, researched lots of info to get us mentally prepared on this journey so we are still going strong.

The only problem lies our dog (we have adopted on our 1st anniversary). For the past 3 years, he lives with my girlfriend (I was in NS then - also a reason why we adopted the dog, so that she will not feel too lonely when I'm in camp), so both of them have a very close relationship, while I would drop by her house to spend time with them every weekends. But due to her studies, he is currently living with me and has been whining every night ever since. He is also not as active as before as he is always curled up at the corner of my room, and isolates himself from other dogs (my cousins brought their dogs over a couple of times and he didn't bother interacting with them). Although I have put them through facetime, he always avoids her. We have talked about this problem, but came to a conclusion that it's impossible for my her to fly back due to her curriculum - a 1 semester per year sort of thing, so she can only comeback around June. Hence, we are rather lost and are really sorry for bringing sadness into his life, despite promising to give him the opposite when we first adopted him. We don't know how to help him and it's rather saddening to see him like this. I have heard of therapies but does it actually work?

Today I witnessed it first hand. NUS chinese male business student here doing internship at a tech company. My Senior manager needed my help today, he said he wanted to send some food. Anyway it’s friday and most of our colleagues are on leave anyway since it’s the festive season

So we ended up at a restaurant where we took packet food for like 300 pax and here i thought it was for a company lunch or something. We ended up at a mosque where he dropped 100 and then he went to another mosque for another 100 before ending up at an orphanage for the remaining food. He says anyone at the mosque can have it for their lunch. And then my Senior manager had lunch with me and got me a grab back to office before him going for Friday prayers himself! So he got back and we had a little chat, and he actually shared that he’s where he never imagined he would be at. He said he never imagined he would have a 5 digit salary and he says that, even before when he Just started working with a 3K starting salary, he tries to give part of his money for the poor or for a good cause because he had nothing to begin with. Hardship in the past kinda story.

 In Uni he used to give free tuition and volunteered every summer break to paint poor people’s house at poor estate. And he said that nobody becomes poorer from giving. Wow I’m seriously amazed, and i’m pretty sure there are many people like these out there! Seriously it made me think bout all the time i want another NMDs or Ultraboost when i already have enough and there are people out there who’s this nice. I’m starting to look at things really differently now.

In contrast i had a senior who just got a $4.4K monthly job told our group of friends that she called the HR to cancel her CDC $5 monthly contribution. Mehhh

At 2pm he suggested catching a movie, but when we checked out GV, there was nothing we fancied. Then he suggested that we Netflix at his place (a few bus stops away from the mall we were at).
We watched 2 movies from 3-7pm, then abit nua so we ordered Grabfood. After dinner, we caught another show from 8-10pm. Throughout the 3 movies, we were together under the blanket on his single bed. It was cozy and it did not feel awkward, felt super comfy to be very honest. At 10++ we had enough of movies and proceeded to lie down and cuddle. 
Things got heated and we went to 3rd base really quickly after making out. However after around 1hr(?) for some reason he was clearly very hesitant and said something like this ""I have been hard for very long and I really want to do it with you. But I think it is better to wait till we are together, not now when things are still ambiguous. Idw to take advantage of you."" 
Woah I was quite taken aback. Though it was indeed anti-climax, and a little traditional, but I guess it shows that he is someone with self-control and serious about this? Not sure... any thoughts guys?

405,"In addition to the “target CAP” method when using SU options, which is what I use, I would also like to add that the popular belief that SU makes your base weaker is building on the “Scarcity Mindset“. It’s stressful and unnecessary.

In reality, a grade below your target honours class will pull your CAP down as much as an equivalent grade above the target class pulling your CAP up, regardless whether you use SU or not. For example, if you aim for Second Upper (4.0), getting a B is going to pull you down as much as a A- is going to pull you up, regardless of your base. Do the math if you don’t believe me.

In any given sem, it’s not like you are only taking one module whereby one bad grade is totally irreversible, most likely you have other mods to balance it out and you still can achieve your target. Live with the Abundance Mindset and be happy. 

Happy 2020 everyone.

Sometimes, I attempt to catch my fart when it comes out, and hold that space of air and quickly place it near his nose so that he gets the full smelly impact.

I guess, we are two lucky souls who managed to find each other on the same weird wavelength. I can see how to other people, they would find our behaviour awfully weird though.

413,"Dear The Man

You saw my weakness and took my silence to your advantage. You viciously forced yourself on me. I remember those big hands of yours, groping my private parts and slipping your dirty hands into my panties. 

I cried hard and helplessly the first time. I hid myself. I called up someone. I couldn't talk. I could only sob. I hung up on them. 

It happened again. I tried avoiding you. You wouldn't stop. I wasn't brave enough to do or say anything immediately. I felt shame and fear. I had so much on my mind, so much reservations, concerns. I tolerated. I gave you the benefit of doubt. I talked with you, time and again. I tried rationalizing with you. I became numbed, then triggered. Now, I questioned my lack of rationality back then. 

Dear The Ones I Spoke Up To

One day, it broke. I broke. I said it out to someone else. I told you. That day, I regret the most. If only, I continued tolerating. If only if only. The hurt wouldn't be this deep, so deep now. 

I spoke up. I wasn't suicidal then, I was desperate for the wrongs to end. But now, I think, I may be so. Because of the aftermath, the re-traumatization, and the additional pain I could had avoided if I did not speak up. The look of disdain on the faces of those I so trusted to speak out to. The horror you put me through. Now, I wake up each day, dreadful, and pained. I go to sleep, wishing my eyes never open again. The nightmares are a constant struggle I fight against every night.

I felt my body was tainted. But now, I feel my body, my heart, my mind, my soul, my everything is way beyond just tainted. I feel inferior and small. I was exposed, I was put through re-humiliation by the ones I so trusted, I was lied to, I was betrayed, misunderstood, and abandoned. I tried forgetting. I couldn't. I tried to trust again. But I am so terrified. Could I ever trust again? Could I survive through this? 

I have been honest, and I will continue to be so. I wanted to live. I wanted to be a blessing. I wanted to survive through and to forge a future I envisioned for myself. But now, I want to give up. Purity is important to me. My body is no longer pure, my life is no longer pure. I no longer know what I am fighting for. My life? What about my life is worth living for now? 

My dear family

Sorry. I am sorry you did not know about all these that have been happening to me. Sorry that I did not share. I felt shame, I felt fear. I did not want to pain you with these, and all the more I do not want to do so now. Please understand me, why I am doing this. I want you to be happy. I know all parents want their children to be happy, too. I want you to know that, I am happy to be your daughter. Sorry that I did not show it enough. I have been drained. And sometimes, it's just hard to keep up with happiness. 

You saw through 20 over years of my life. You saw how hard I've fought for what I wanted. I was so bad in my studies I was mocked at when I was young. And so, I worked hard in my studies, for my grades, for the scholarships. I juggled my studies and work and tutoring. Once, I juggled multiple jobs in a single period. Tough, but you saw it, I never complained. And I genuinely was happy. I looked forward to meals with you. I wanted to see you smile, hear you laugh. I wanted you to be happy. I wanted a successful life, I wanted to be the daughter you could be proud of. I was proud of my achievements, and at the same time, cherished the simplicity of our lives. 

There were times I was down, times when I felt defeated and drained. But these were the moments when I bounced back up, higher. I had moments of sadness and failures, but I never let them keep me down for long. I knew what I wanted. I had my ambitions, my aspirations, my dreams and goals. I knew your expectations of me, and I knew the expectations I had for myself. 

However, this one setback has kept me down for way too long. You questioned, too. I've been doing a lot of things out of the norm recently, doing things for myself, things I normally don't. All just because I was fighting hard to keep my will to live. Fighting hard to see beyond the current suffering and pain, to see again the gift of life. But they aren't helping. And I know I can't sustain anymore. I know I can't spend anymore money on myself just to try to keep myself alive; our finances are tight. 

Now, I just want to be selfish. What will happen to you if I were to do what I want to do now? Probably heartbroken, and more traumatized than I ever am now. Will you understand me? Could I ever forgive myself? That plunge sometimes is so tempting. I just want to say that, please know that I love you, I really do. Sorry that I've never said it. 

My dear friends

If this gets posted, if you read this, and you are my friend, and if you suspect this to be me, please reach out to me. I yearned to have someone with me during this period of my life. I don't even know who I am addressing this to, because I have been so busy studying and working hard my life. I don't spend much time with anyone, other than my family. Do I really have friends, friends who will know this is me, and will be willing to reach out to me? I just know I don't want to be alone. It has been a way too lonely and frightening journey. 

Since that day, I only wish someone would hold my hands and walk me through the darkest days of my life, till I see light. But I am still struggling my way alone in this valley of darkness. Lost, drained, and hopeless. 

Dear Self

Sorry that I failed you this time.

I went to the Dean's office the next day to speak to the vice dean and she said they considered all such cases if they can pull up any module grade before releasing the final grade. She told me if I needed the second upper for future masters, they are happy to write a letter of recommendation. I left disappointed. Subsequently I managed to get into banking and it was a tough time as it was aftermath of Lehman.

The only impact the second lower had on my first job was $200 lower on my starting salary. I managed to jump to other bigger banks and got promoted a few times. I am in a higher position than my peers who scored better than me in school. Banking is cut throat industry where one has to work smart and grades doesn't matter anymore. it's performance but I have to say SMU graduates are more vocal and NUS grad are more competent technically which is our disadvantage as in the corporate world, if you can speak better, management will take notice of you more. 

it's more important to have fun in your uni days and go for an exchange if you can. memories cannot be bought. No hurry to come out to work as you have the whole lifetime to work.

417,"This is kinda a response to the recent posts about loner people

I'm a loner too, and somewhat socially awkward. Although according to my peers/people I meet it's the cute/funny kinda of awkward so I don't really know what to make of that. 

Personally, I don't have issues talking to people. When I want to, I can converse no problem, but most of the time I choose not to socialise. And for me there's a simple reason behind it

Everyone has a limited amount of attention to give, or in my own words: ""forks"" to give (I'm substituting the original word to make it more family friendly). Everyone is born with a different number of them, and everyone chooses to distribute them differently. Assuming someone has 20 forks, her/she may choose to give 10 people 1 fork each, and 2 people 5 forks each. Another person might only have 10 forks, and chooses to give 5 to one person, and keep 5 for himself/herself. 

Some people (like me) are the second type. We have no problem socialising when we need/want to, but we choose not to, because we want to save our limited time and attention for those who really matter. Not saying that it's bad to distribute your forks too widely, it's just how everyone chose to live their lives. Also not saying that every loner is the second type of person. Some might genuinely have issues giving out their forks even if they want or need to. 

Hope this helps people understand what loners (at least some of us) are thinking.

419,"Hi. I have been working for about 3 years after graduation, and I can really sense the growing generation gap in Singapore. You don't feel it much interacting in school, where we tend to respect and treat each other as equals. (Would suck if your circle of friends don't) But when you step into society, there are some really serious dysfunction in action.

(Disclaimer, I don't mean that all from the older generation are like that, but enough of them to ruin your experience in society and question your faith in humanity)

It begins with the parents. Asking for help with technology. At first, they seem reasonable and I don't mind helping. But then they start bugging you at the most inopportune moment, when you're writing an email, when you're are rushing for a work deadline. Followed by the ""I have raised you for 20 years, and you can't even help me with just this 1 small thing?"" Even though this is the 20th time I have guided them to download photos from their phone, or to escape the digital tv menu screen.

It doesn't get any better at work. How a finance/IT manager manage to even survive at their job without decent Excel skills elude me. How they just assume fresh grads would be better than them at Excel reeks of intentional helplessness. Especially when none of us ever learnt it in school. Fine, I get it that we're more IT savvy than the older generation. But darn it, this is your world too. Learn to explore it!

All this just erodes your willingness to help others. Because by rewarding such behaviour, they'll just bother you more frequently. Not only would you be giving yourself more work, you'll eventually be doing work that is rightfully theirs. At least this is still tolerable for those who appreciate your efforts, but...

Enter those senior members of the company/community who look down upon anyone of a lower position. They won't even bother to hide the disdain they feel towards you. The more discreet of them would spread gossip about you. But you may happen to encounter that self-respecting kind who would literally shove you aside to exert dominance or demand respect.

And it doesn't help that these people usually surround themselves with yesmen. Perhaps the long term results of the organisational structure or culture. The more benign ones would just close their eyes to abuse of authority, complicit in their silence. Then there are those who would take every opportunity to flaunt devotion to their superiors, treating any utterances as words of wisdom. And when you want to chime in to the conversation, they would tell you off for disrespecting your elders. 

Sigh... it is just so demoralising working with such people. I am truly sympathetic to the Ok Boomer movement.

424,"I know some post asking about SU are from trolls, but for those freshmen who don't know which mod they should SU, this is a rough guide for you
To determine what to SU, Look at your CAP
5.0 - 4.25: B+ and below
4.24 - 3.75: B and below
3.74 - 3.25: B- and below
3.24 - 2.75: C+ and below
2.74 - 2.5: D and below. Though if you think that you wouldn't get more than 2 C+ for mods that can be SU-ed next sem, then SU C+ as well.
This is just my opinion though and there's more consideration to be made, such as your desired honors, deviation of grades or how well you will do next sem. However, if you don't want to think too much into it, then I feel that this is a pretty good guide to go with.

Merry Xmas and have a good break!

425,"In modern days, majority of the people always enjoy what they are doing as they have the similar kind of feelings towards each other, be it songs, things, attitude, behavior etc. But what about the people who do things differently? These are the people who are labelled as weird, odd, negative, stupid, eye-sickening etc. Take myself as an example. 

I am a 19 years old guy, which falls under the “weird/minority” category. People rarely wants to make friends with me as I do not fall under the “majority” standards. Most of them treats me as the odd one out, a fellow where stuff that I do naturally is under bad and aggressive in their eyes. This is just one of the few reasons, there is a lot more which I am not going to list it down. 

Life is unfair for those that are categorized under “weird/minority” category. Majority of the people will strike us down if we wanted to do something like playing a heavy metal playlist. Most of them will just turn off your music and listen to theirs instead, but you have no choice but to give in to them just because that they fall under the majority category. Sometimes I wonder, why can’t the majority give in to the minority and let them do what they want for a few times. It might be good. Sometimes even majority can be bad, but they will just set it a side and if the same situation goes for the minorities, they get blamed, abused, ignored, laughed at. 

Let’s have a scenario. I was in a party of 12, they were playing music loudly. Initially a song of Nirvana came out, I told them not to skip it as I love these kinds of songs and it’s rare to hear it in a party too, Majority of them were like “stupid kind of taste, loud and aggressive music is bad, shit music”. And they just skipped the song and put up their own Electronic kinds of songs. Sadly, I couldn’t do anything about it because I’m always in the minority side of life. After the incident, I felt really left out and decided to go to a corner to enter my own world of fantasy as I know that no one is going to enjoy the stuff that I’m enjoying. Majority of them were really hyped and delighted with their music where as it is the opposite for me.

Sometimes we as the minority will feel that no one can understand us, hence this is where mental health starts to crumble. Depression and Anxiety will start to kick in. All we want is to be acknowledged by majority of the people, where people can acknowledge us and without being judged. For those who fall into the same category as me, which is under the minority, life is unfair for us, am I right? 

Of course, being treated this way improves our survival mental thinking, we are more independent than the majority as we minorities will feel ominous most of the time, hence building a wall and keeping everything to ourselves. Also, minority tend to be kinder as they must always give in to the majority and we are probably used to it, but kindness would have to draw a limit too to balance it out, if not, we are taken advantaged of basically.

For those who feel that you guys fall under minorities, you guys are real strong, I know that it will be tiring but we would have to fight on. And for the majorities, please give in to us sometimes. Would appreciate it a lot.

On one hand he kept apologizing and saying he dont wanna lose me. Yet on the other hand he's still out there telling everyone he's single for v long and playing with girls.

I have seen people with 10 years and above or less than 3 years leaving their respective firms as they were done with learning or had enough experience to have a more challenging career. But the key is the jump must be to a ideal firm that can provide platform to perform, which then leads to higher salary and better remuneration package.

I'm in the exact spot as you, except that I'm a male. Dating apps aren't the right place (girls just want to meet me for flings, when I'm looking for something serious).

There's kind of no way to help, friends and even those online will just tell you to wait for the right one to come. But will they ever come?

I would say, just expand your social circle, I've been trying my best to do that, and started to know more people of the opposite gender. You'll start to know what to look for soon. I found that I prefer girls who are more mature and know what they want to do with life (unfortunately, most of these girls are attached).

This is a message from one of your CS1010S students this sem(1). I would just like to say that you are my idol. I have only ever attended one of your physical lectures (the final one when you came to the 10am class) and from then I could see why so many students admire you, due to either your intellect or humorous yet still serious presentation. Besides that, your comments on NUSWhispers is also something that I find hilarious and insightful at the same time.

Albeit the fact that CS1010S was (to me at least) a pretty hellish mod which caused me a lot of trauma and war flashbacks, the way it was delivered was still pretty fun and enjoyable for some reason. Additionally, this mod has helped me forge several close friendships due to the mutual suffering :"") so it is surely an unforgettable mod (and perhaps the best mod this sem?).

Initially, I thought that you were just a savage and killer prof who would roast a student for every mistake they made, but after seeing how you actually advise students on NUSWhispers or in real life regarding anything ranging from school advice to relationship advice, I can see that my first impression was false. So, I would like to just thank you for creating CS1010S, teaching us there, and being you :)

437,"For all the worried freshies out there, here's some advice my senior gave me on whether or not you should S/U your modules. It helped me decide and I hope it helps you, all the best & happy holidays!

1) If you score A+, A, or A-, please don't S/U that module. You'll need those grades to pull up your CAP.
2) If you score F, please just S/U (U) that module. You will have to retake the module or substitute with another module in another semester regardless and letting the F grade stand will affect your CAP. Drastically.
3) If you score C+ or C, you should S/U (S) that module. Those are probably the worst passing grades you are going to get.

4) If you score D+ or D, Take note that if you do S/U (U) that module, you will need to overload another semester to retake that module (or substitute with another module). The good thing is that this U grade will not affect your CAP now. However, if you decide to keep the grade, then you will not need to overload for this module but it will affect your CAP (D+ and D give 1.5 and 1.0 respectively). So it is really your choice here of whether to rid a bad grade and overload later, or really push urself harder for the other modules. 

5) Finally, if you score B+, B, B-, aha this is really difficult, and there is no one-size-fits-all answer. It really depends on what is your target CAP at the end of your 4 years. For example, if you intend to get 2nd Lower (3.50 - 3.99), then you should keep the B+ (4.0) and S/U (S) the B- (3.0). Surprisingly, it makes no difference to the Honours Class whether you keep or S/U (S) the B (3.5). This gives you a ""safety net"" to play with. If you intend to get 2nd Lower but are scared to drop to 3rd Class (3.20 - 3.49), then keep the B. If you think you have some chance to push to 2nd Upper (4.00 - 4.49), then S/U (S) the B.

6) One more thing! Contrary to popular belief, your overall CAP is weighted per module (or MCs to be more precise), not per semester. If you get 5.00 this sem (by S/U-ing all except your only A) and 4.00 next sem (e.g. getting B+ for every module), your overall CAP after 2 semesters is NOT 4.50 but will be lesser (probably 4.17). This shows that the CAP is calculated based on the modules, not based on the semester. So don't think you'll have a free ride by S/U-ing everything except your only A, because you will suffer in the later semesters.

tl;dr: S/U all C's and F's. Keep all A's. As for B's, ask yourself what CAP you want to achieve. If u aiming for 1st class, SU all B+ and below. If aiming for 2nd upper, SU all B and below, keep ur B+
In case anyone finds this useful ????

Is it something to do with the local culture? Is sex seen as a taboo here? I grew up with the mindset that sex is a very normal human thing to do, I mean isn't it something everyone enjoys with our genetic disposition. The age of consent in my country is 15 and people start doing it from a young age, I am very surprised to experience a culture where people who are around 20 and in university are still afraid to discuss these topics.

I’m a Yr4 Accounting senior and my first sem in biz was dismal. 2B+and 2C+, by calculation it’s a third class. Spent the next few days in shock.

The subsequent compulsory accounting mods against very smart, driven students (most of which have been in elite schools their whole lives) saw about the same results. These peeps scored at least 5-6 distinctions in A levels at that time so the competition was really tough.

Managed to pull to a second lower by end of Y2 but always felt inadequate- never knew anyone below Cap4 (either that or some people were lying) but gradually as I cleared my compulsory mods and explored modules outside my faculty and more towards my interest like languages and philo, I found myself putting much less effort for much better grades. Consistently got 2-3As which pulled my Y3S2 Cap to a 3.9.

With FYP this sem was just nice CAP4.0. When I received my SMS (usually I can’t sleep the day before) I literally cried

Basically, it’s entirely possible for someone to jump 2 classes with the right determination, right module choices with just the right friends and company to push you to succeed.

For context, I secured my job in September, having interviewed in August, and since then school for me has just been running through the motions. I never put in a shift in project work nor did I fight for class participation as I have done previously, never bothered or interested in my modules - after all, they were unrelated to my job. 

As expected, the results confirmed my honours class. I felt a distinct sense of emptiness. What have I been fighting for all these time. Jobs? Nah, most employers only need minimum second class uppers. To the juniors worrying about their CAP in your junior years, my advice is to chill out and immerse your self in personal growth, learning and employment experiences that are relevant to you because these are what employers will query in the interview. 

Yes, it is possible to increase your CAP, and it is normal to start off poorly, given the noise you face as a freshman in the first year and you are still finding direction and footing in school. I pulled up my CAP from a floor of 4.17 in my first semester to secure first class, but it does require some commitment and tenacity

463,"Dear all,
I am a Y1 Computer Engineering student, and have received my results like everyone one day back. Sadly, i got a D for one of my core module, CS1010. This is also a prerequisite for my upcoming module, CS2040C, and subsequently CS2040C will be a prerequisite for many of my other modules. Thus, I am not sure if I can SU my CS1010 such that I can still graduate on time/not mess up my schedule. FYI, here is our recommended CEG schedule given to us at the start of the semester. To CEG seniors/profs/anyone who is reading this, much help is appreciated! Thank you and Merry Christmas!

Me and my ex boyfriend (both alumni bunch) broke off almost two years ago and we were from different racial and ethnic backgrounds (I am a chinese and he is Indian). The reason why we broke off is due to our familial and cultural differences. Basically my parents did not want me marrying or being in a relationship with a non chinese guy and his family did not want him marrying a non Indian girl either. We came to a mutual understanding and broke off the relationship because of the familial differences and needs.

I'm not sure if it's too late to even get back together now. I just want to put it out there, since I have witnessed many posts about couples going through cultural differences on this page.... that if you are facing any cultural/racial/religious differences in your relationship which your family does not approve of or could be an impediment...please fight for it if you truly value it...because it may pay off in the longer run.

If you recall I wrote a post about how getting stared at is rude and people seemed to think that staring at is socially acceptable. (people thought I was wrong for being upset) 

Today this incident happened at Clementi Mall. An aunty “tsk” at a teenage boy and he got upset (entitled aunty who obviously don’t know how to respect people) The boy hurled vulgarities and got slapped by the aunty’s daughter, and the boy of course was gonna fight back. The boy definitely wasn’t wrong, he didn’t start it and didn’t deserve to get slapped by the daughter for HER MOTHERS actions 

This is EXACTLY why I said Singaporean’s need to use their brains and learn what being socially aware means. A lot of Singaporean’s have no Social Awareness and a lot of these Aunties think they’re damn entitled because they “built Singapore” 

Lampah backside lah. Learn to respect people. Don’t stare at people and don’t tsk at people. 
One day someone who is uneducated and doesn’t know what being socially aware means, would get beat up for either staring // tsking at another person. 

Please learn to respect others, and if you got nothing good to say, don’t say.

Admittedly, I've been rather fortunate over the past two and a half years when it comes to my results in NUS. I have gotten either As or A*s for all my modules thus far, and not had to use a single SU. This has allowed me to maintain an outstanding CAP of 5. However, from the results that were just released this morning, I got an A- for one of my level 1000 UE modules.

I am faced with this dilemma - should I use my SU so that I can maintain my CAP at 5.0 and not let my CAP drop to 4.9? However doing so would leave a S grade in my transcript that is really ugly. 

Alternatively, I could keep my A- grade, but that would cause my CAP to drop to 4.9 which is equally ugly on my transcript.

Can someone advice me? Thanks!

Add this with my 2 years of NS and its been 6 years since I actually talk or interact properly with any girls. 

Recently, I met a girl friend of mine one-on-one to pass her some lights that she told me she needed for Christmas. I offered to travel to her place since I was free that day. When I reached her place, she had made lunch for me and invited me to chill around. I found the gesture really sweet and at that moment, for the first time, I thought she looked really cute and sweet (I have no idea why I never noticed this despite knowing her for 7 years already). 

we had lunch and ice cream for desert (it was sorbet and i wasn't really a fan) and then we just sat on her sofa and chit chatted for around an hour. 
sorry to disappoint any readers but no we didn't do anything, but ever since that day which was around a week ago, I keep thinking about her even though I've been trying to block it out. 

I can't tell if this counts as cheating and if its because because I am very inexperienced with girls and fell into infatuation easily but I've been feeling really guilty to my girlfriend and trying to spend more time with her since its the holidays now as well.

Their conversations were so flirty, definitely not between two normal friends. My boyfriend and I went to watch Star Wars with my family last Saturday.

I cannot continue living in the past forever. It took me so much effort to rebuild my life. I almost destroyed my life in 2018 when you decided not to give us a second chance. Fortunately, my boss gave me a chance to redeem myself. 
I wonder if you know how badly I wish I am the guy in the alternate universe who continued fighting for the relationship back then and is now happily married to you.

I felt annoyed and had to relocate elsewhere. I have been studying in PC Commons for semesters and ppl usually study there silently.

I feel like I'll disappoint the person I meet, so I'd rather meet people in real life. I'm also not someone who is easily attracted to someone by appearance. My attractions usually develop after getting to know someone, so I worry I pass up on people who aren't immediately attractive but I would have liked.

524,"I'm not sure if I should break up with my boyfriend of 7 years. We were together since we were in Secondary 3. You would just look at me and smile at me in class!!! Urghhhh. Sometimes, we would even eat lunch together, or hang out and chill at Lot 1 after school. Even though we were in different CCAs, we still managed to spend time with each other. We hid our relationship from our parents cause we knew they were against our relationship. Only our schoolmates and probably teachers knew about us and everyone thought that we were so cute together. They even thought that our relationship would last.

Then came JC. Both of us agreed to enter the same JC and went on to SAJC together. We took different combinations and only had same lecture and tutorials for Maths, Chemistry and Physics.  Still remember the time you bought me an exam welfare pack before A levels to wish me all the best! That's super cute and I super adore you. We had more arguments than usual especially in JC, but I don't blame you since both of us are feeling the pressure to do well in JC and go to a good school together in NUS. Eventually we managed to get through it and graduate from SAJC together. 

You got a higher score than me for A levels and you went to Business and Accountancy while I settled for Mechanical engineering. Due to the difference in courses, we spent less time together as our timetables clashed and it's not feasible to just walk to each other's school just to meet up for lunch. You usually spend your time with your clique instead of meeting me to go home together. How I wish both of us were staying on campus so that we can meet up more often. It's like things changed ever since we entered university. You claimed that you were busy on weekends trying to finish up your tutorials and understanding the lecture but half the time your Instagram stories show that you are outside with your clique! Because of this we started arguing and we started to talk less. 

We haven't talked for about a week and I'm not sure what to do. Should I message him first and talk to him and clear the doubts, and try to be understanding towards him? I mean it's the holidays, we all know that there is no work to do during the holidays but he hasn't been talking to me much ever since the end of the examinations.

But anyway, it's the end of Year 1 Sem 1 for both of us. Results are coming out real soon and I hope that you read this message and score really well, as it's your dream to get a GPA of at least 4.5!!

Hope things will go back to the things they were, especially the times when we were in NS where we usually meet up on the weekends to talk and chill :)

For MA1511 I scored full marks for the assignments and attendance portion (35%) for finals (65%) I could only confidently do one question, the rest were just drips and drabs of workings with no solutions. 

For MA1512, which I am most nervous about, the quiz (20%) which I did and compared with my friends answers so hopefully fingers crossed I can at least pass. Finals (80%) was a bloodbath. There was no one question I could say that I did confidently, half of my attempts ended in me not being able to continue on, the other half ended up with weird answers that even I myself could not believe would be true but it was the best that I could do. I did do the past year papers but this years paper to me was a whole new level of not even knowing what formula or method to even start with. 

In addition, I'd like to ask for some advice on whether I should SU and remod if I get a D grade for core mods. Is it worth it to remod them for the sake of not crashing one's CAP or should I take the D and work harder to raise my CAP in future? (and would it be impossible to raise my CAP to second upper which i heard during orientation is the average for engin)

526,"Hi OP of #73996, I hope you reconsider breaking up with that loner ex-boyfriend of yours. I was just like you and I felt really bad for being like that.

My first boyfriend was also like a loner. He rarely went out with friends. He would only text me and his family and school mates only when necessary. He would spend most of his time studying, gaming and going out with me. I thought he was so weird and broke up with him. 

After that I happened to meet someone who's very different. Someone who would always hang out with friends, family, relatives. He was always texting people, attending events and gatherings and helping people with their chores. I was just a tiny part of his life and so I broke up with him. 

Eventually I met someone who is also like a loner. He does almost everything alone. Studying, shopping, eating, etc. He doesn't have many friends, just one or two that he sees a few times a year. He doesn't have many hobbies. He only likes reading books and watching tv.

I thought he was weird too. He doesn't go out with friends, he doesn't use any form of social media. He actually likes being alone. He thinks going out with people can be tiring so he politely rejects people from time to time. 

But he likes being with me alot. As we started working, we would travel to work together every morning, have breakfast every weekend, watch netflix on saturday nights. Ever since we started working, time has become so scarce. He has to work late every day. Work is highly stressful for him so he cherishes our weekend together. 

Eventually I became just like him. Working late nights and feeling too tired to do anything at all. Sometimes I dread outings and gatherings. My house became my favourite place to hang out. I don't feel like going out, don't feel like seeing anyone. I just need someone who makes me feel like I can totally be myself, someone who has seen me at my worst and still loves me no less. And that someone is that loner boyfriend of mine. 

He doesn't really want to hang out with people but he wants to hang out with me. I guess there's no better way of saying how special you are to someone. I don't care if he's weird or I've become weird because of him. If weird means being all comfortable and relaxed then I would gladly choose to be weird.

He just like to let everyone breath in his smoke. I wonder if he's just extremely selfish or he's a sadist who wants everyone to suffer with him? The fact that my brother and I have childhood asthma didn't even budge him in stopping smoking in front of us. 
 
The worst part is that he's smoking contraband cigarettes which smells like poison. Life at home became hell ever since he started smoking contraband cigarettes from his room, with his windows closed, door opened, with his fan blowing the smoke out into the whole house. That time, I didn't have a room of my own and literally felt like dying whenever he snaps the lighter. During my A level year, it's just so depressing that after a hectic day, what welcomes you back home is the smell of smoke. Hence I dreaded going home and tried to stay in school until late night. 

He started smoking that trash since around 2015 and I wonder why the smuggler still hasn't been caught, even though I keep seeing news of contraband cigarettes being found at immigration customs. I actually tried filing a report in the SG customs app as a man used to come to our house regularly to sell those cigarettes wrapped in newspaper to my dad. However, I think my efforts were futile...

Now, I have my own room and can avoid the smoke more but the whole house is still smelly because of him, so I'm looking forward to moving out into my own house. Nonetheless, I'm still worried about my family's health since we are living in an environment like Indonesia with the forest fire... My mum and I wear a mask at home but my stubborn younger brother doesn't...

She suspects that I am in a relationship with another girl when in reality there is none going on or gets frustrated with me for some random reason that she comes up with. Few weeks ago we were hanging out in town and I was on my phone, she suddenly decides to pull the phone out of my hand and throw it directly at my face(which hit my jaw quite hard by the way). When I questioned her about it she just walked away without saying anything. She is reluctant to have a conversation with me and have even let her search through my phone to let her see that I am not cheating on her. However she still does not seem convinced. She has also been giving me random slaps and punches for no reason while I am over at her place(she does not live with her family), and I have stopped meeting her in private areas because of this for the past few months. But she seems to be doing this in public spaces as well in a less obvious manner. It never used to be like this during the first year of our dating and getting to know each other in uni. It was a really memorable and great time that we shared in the past. We have both graduated and are in pretty decent jobs with some financial stability. Is this some sort of mental illness that this sociopath can get help for or should I just break this damn nightmare of a relationship this is turning into? But I am also afraid to break this relationship off at this point because our social circle of friends have become very intertwined...basically my friends are also her friends vice versa... and she we also go to the same church almost every week which makes things even worst. Our friends have no clue what is going on and they assume that we are a happy couple. How do I break this off without damaging my current social circle of friends? Has any guy encountered similar situations like this before? Your insight can be really helpful...Mental illness is a serious problem these days ...

Faster tell me to do so....."" and I did as what she told me to.

533,"How do I deal with feeling that I'm never good enough?

I've always have this feeling that I'm underperforming, not good enough etc, even if the facts/my peers are telling me otherwise.

My peers are always telling me 
""Take a break, you've worked hard enough today.""
""You don't have to work constantly.""
""Rest, no need to be so stressed.""

But I just can't sit still when there's incomplete stuff to be done. I used to panic a lot before I submit my assignments, always paranoid that I might have made a huge mistake somewhere. 

It's not that I don't get validation for my work. I never scored less than a B+ for my tests and assignments. I have consistently maintained a 4.2-ish CAP for the past 4 years. During my internships, my coworkers and superiors have praised my work. But the thing is that I have somehow unintentionally conditioned myself to tune out these compliments/positive feedback. No matter how many times I receive the validation, it never ""calms"" me. I always feel like I'm not performing up to standards/expectations. I always feel like I'm below average. I can never list down my strengths and achievements easily, but have not problem listing down entire pages of my weaknesses and past mistakes. 

Right now, I have graduated. While attending a job interview a couple of weeks ago, the interviewers asked me to elaborate on my strengths, and I got totally stumped. Did manage to cook up something eventually, but I don't remember what I said, only that it wasn't completely coherent. To my surprise, I actually got the offer. Now that I'm 2 weeks into my first job, the paranoia is really driving me nuts. I am constantly worried about underperforming, and is seriously questioning why I got hired in the first place.  Even though it's not showing yet, I feel that it'll affect my performance in the long run.

This thing is hurting my interpersonal and romantic relationships as well. I was really close to this girl about a year back, and I'm very certain there's mutual attraction, and she's only waiting for me to pop the question/take action. However, at some point I started questioning what she saw in me, and feeling I'm not good enough for her. I started avoiding her even though she showed consistent concern and affection. Eventually I ghosted her and y'all can guess the rest.

How should I manage this paranoia? How do I effectively tell myself: ""Chill the fk out, you're doing fine.""? It's really driving me insane.

Although this article is old, the threat of scammers and hackers seeking your phone number for whatever purposes they have is still real. Just recently, a friend of mine got hacked on facebook. Apparently, another facebook friend of his who was already hacked, asked for his phone number for some 'Lazada gift cards competition' and he was subsequently hacked. 

The hacked account then goes on asking other facebook friends via messenger for their phone numbers for 'Lazada gift cards competition' etc, possibly in an attempt to hijack more accounts or perform other actions. The hacker also changed the email and log in info of the hacked person to give the person a harder time to recover the account.

Do contact your friends through other platforms to verify it is them before giving the (possibly) hackers your phone number! 

Meanwhile, if you get hacked, do remember to check your bank account too to ensure that no fraudulent charges has been made to your account!

Since our r/s had some sort of 'deadline', we had sex (the only time) but I noticed that it felt so uninspired.

I ve been wanting to ask this for a while now.

Looking back on having taken CS1101S last sem, and now looking ahead towards taking 2030/2040 next sem, I feel that I did not really learn much actual programming from the CS1101S module. While we did cover some key ideas like abstraction and recursion, I feel that we did not really learn much from the module as a lot of the time was more so spent being thrown a new tool and then left to sink or swim, trying to complete the ""mission"". 

It honestly felt more like an exercise in getting the feel for a new tool, ie the runes missions, then the graph thing, each and every week rather than actually introducing us to new ways of problem solving, through manipulating the ways we interact with the input data to solve the problems.

Why not instead introduce us to the key ideas of computational problem solving skills and at the same time, the appropriate data structures to use to solve such problems instead of separating the two into different modules?

Thanks!

550,"So I came to Singapore to do my national service and university although I wasn't really into studying. I've been told I look quite good so over the years I hooked up with a few pretty girls and we've been friends with benefits, meeting up every week or so. They are always so eager to show affection and to be honest I find them a little too clingy. I always treat them very well and since my family is pretty well-off, I pay for most of our outings and even the hotels when we didn't have any place.

Anyway, I try to show them that we are just casual friends (when they ask me about serious topics like what we are, I reply saying that we are still young and should discuss this in the future). But now, most of them are graduating and I feel like they are pressuring me to marry or propose to them. Two of them even asked me to meet their family during the next Chinese New Year and there's a real crazy one. Initially she started stalking me, but recently she even claimed that she's pregnant and wants me to go to the doctor with her. Obviously I ignored and blocked her number.

I'm genuinely perplexed, I understand that Chinese girls are more traditional in ""that"" aspect, but what are they even expecting from me?? To me it's just about mutual enjoyment, having a good time but apparently they don't feel the same way. I guess you can't even treat a girl nice without them catching some sort of feelings.

I'm not saying I am not open to a serious relationship, but I don't think they are worth spending more time on anymore.

Help. I'm confused?

Suddenly he said rather seriously “I’m not planning to get married anyway” I was rather shocked that he said that so I didn’t ask him to elaborate more about why he said that. 
He is single at the moment but he had an ex in the past (so I guess that he is straight and not gay)
But since he had said that I guess this is a sign for me to get over him.

Introvert, working adult, girl in her 20s~

Just want to get some opinion. Do you think it's weird or just wrong for a girl like me to have no social life? I only have that 1 or 2 friends that I go 'hey how are you' once in a blue moon, and goes to movies alone lol (yes I do)... Shopping alone... To be honest I'm embarrassed to admit to people I'm like this but if you ask me if I am comfortable, then yes, most of the time I am happy and content with my life but sometimes I do feel lonely and wishing I had some close friends to turn to or to go places with me that kind of thing.

I think I've seen a few similarish posts here so I'm writing here for advice too. We've been together for a while, soon to be two years, but I'm starting to take him seriously now and it kind of freaks me out that I don't really trust him and I feel like I should verbalize this to him but I'm not sure how I should do it. By not trusting him, I mean, I feel that he would be the kind of person who would abandon the family in time of need (e.g I get cancer! Our kids have ADHD! Or I lose my jobs ((I'm not working yet, still in uni but he is)). I also feel like he would be the kind of person who would leave the minute we have a major disagreement (everything has been smooth sailing so far, he's very chill and I'm very tolerant). I know it feels unfair to assume the worst of someone but how do I know that he's not going to flake out on me? We've been blessed enough to not be put through any major trials or tribulations but that does make me worry that he's not ""man enough"" to handle them when they inevitably come. 

He has this whole air of ""If you're not happy, leave."" Am I an asshole for feeling that he's not reliable at all?

A part of me feels that marrying a person like that is just asking for trouble even though he's been great in every other aspect so far - yet is asking for reassurance in this area bad? Even if I tell him this, what can he do to prove that he's going to stick around? Or what can I do to reassure myself?

I don’t blame him for that because I do hide things from him as well as I don’t want him to worry about me. But what makes me sad is that he shares almost everything with his friends. Recently he was texting a friend (a girl) while going on a date with me. I peeped at his phone and saw that they were chatting very happily away. This triggered memories of the days when we used to joke with each other before we officially dated- our messages were full of funny things. He used to text me almost daily to ask me about my day. Unlike now- we barely communicate, perhaps only when we meet up. Thus, on the day when I caught him talking to the girl, I suddenly lost my temper with him. The girl whom he has been talking to is also from his major, naturally they will have many common topics. Whenever my bf talks to me about those technical terms from his major, I (from a different major) will just listen without understanding anything. Sometimes I feel neglected and sad but I always put on a happy face in front of him. He is a smart guy- sometimes I feel I’m too stupid for him, and I’m not good enough.  I’m not asking for his attention 24 hours a day, just a word of concern from him each day is enough to light up my day.

As a 25 year old guy, I expect you to have some people around you. Relatives, cousins, friends, someone! I'm an introvert too but I find him extreme. He works out by himself everyday, watches football, plays FIFA. I've asked him to at least watch football at a coffeeshop so you are around people, find some football fans online so you can talk to people. He can go weeks without anyone other than me and his fam talking to him. I couldn't stand it. I broke up.

How did he manage to get a gf then? He had so much time on his hands that he was always there for me, every impromptu lunch, every text at whatever time, he replied, he showed up.

Now, I'm moving on with my life but I'm worried for him. He refuses to change himself, he says he likes stability and is working on himself. But you won't grow just by being alone. You grow by talking, sharing, giving and being surrounded by people.

I asked him, ""Have you felt happy in the recent few years?""
He replied, ""No. I feel peaceful and that's enough for me.""

587,"There is something which I would love to get off my chest and rant about, not a troll post here, I would love to get some advice comments about this. No hateful comments here please :(  Sorry for my not-so-fluent english. 

Long rant ahead.. 

Story 1:

My bf (25y) and I (19y) have been together for close to 3 years. However, something that he have done recently made me doubt our rsl. 

One day when he came home from work he was 'not being the usual him' and was talking to me 'in a very nice way' (?) I knew him for 4 years so I could tell if he was hiding from me something/ did something guilty. Immediately i felt something was wrong. I know its wrong to check his phone without asking for his permission first but i just cant hold back my curiousness anymore. 

Long story short i checked his phone when he is not around and caught him sexting another gaming girl. My heart was literally aching and I teared up when I saw the conversation. Well based on the conversation on this gaming app i saw, he asked the girl for 'pics', but the girl apparently said she was too tired. The short conversation ended just right there, but before that there were afew phone calls made between them, so this could have happen long time ago without me knowing.

This has happened before, not sexting but cheesy way of talking to other girls online. Trust me, I have confronted him countless times and we 'had that talk before'. I ended up giving myself another chance/hope to forgive him and that it would not happen again. However, i thought that this has gone too far. 

I apologised to him first for looking at his phone without his permission, then confronted him about it and he said he was not hiding it from me (he had password on his phone and i unlocked it to check). He thought it was ok to sext with me knowing? He said he is not hiding anything as he said IT IS SIMILAR TO WATCHING P**N ONLINE ?!? LIKE HOW??! He said as long he's not showing any of his pictures to the other party it does not count as sext?!?! CAN SOMEONE PLEASE ENLIGHTEN ON THIS?!? Am i right or his right on this?!? Instead of showing any remorse, he kinda said that it is normal??!? to do it ??! Obviously i was pissed off and ignore him when he tried to coaxed me the entire night. He asked me if I still want him or not and I said Idk. 

Long story short, I still forgive him the next day because he promised me that he would not do it again. Am I being too nice to forgive him?  He cried and told me he would change and he wants to marry and have a family with me next time... we have spend so much time together and I do not want to leave him as well :( On the other hand, I kinda felt that I was being guilt trip to forgive him... 

Now Im lying on the bed while typing this, doubting my whole rsl with him every night, I am trying my best to trust him but I cry in bed silently at night with him beside me whenever I remembered what happen. I spend some nights at his house with him). I have never felt so self conscious and heart-broken after it happened :( 

Story 2: 

I guess many of you experienced the after-honeymoon period phase after a relationship. I felt like my relationship with him it getting more ""awkward"" as time passes by. We have lesser/nothing to talk about in real life/in text. Trust me I have suggested to go out to try new food/activities, but idk why but it just feels sooooo awkward to me. I feel like we are just sticking together just because we have no one else? I am feeling so tired in this relationship and i felt like we just so used to each other? Sometimes when i try to make conversations with him he just seems disinterested and gives me short reply. I love texting and I used to love texting him, ever since his reply have gotten cold, i have stopped. How i wish he would text me frequently :( 

Sigh I am getting so tired in this relationship, I have though of breaking up... I think me and him would be better off as friends? (I only have a few friends, and they are really busy with school/work, this is the reason why i was reluctant to break up with him, I was afraid to be alone). 

His family loves me so much, especially his mom who treats me so well, I can't bear to leave them :( 
To note, My bf does not mistreats me in anyway, he often buys me food i love and things i like for special occasions. I do the same to him too. 

Well I guess i will end my rant here.

Recently I had to go for an overseas programme where we were separated into groups. My group members are very nice and helpful people but for some reason, I can't bring myself to open up fully to them. Sometimes when we have conversations during breaks, they tend to be short and awkward. However, the rest of them were able to talk to one another comfortably and always seem to have endless conversations. This confuses me because I don't seem to have the rapport with my group but I don't have this problem when I'm talking to people from other groups whom I met during the trip as well. Throughout the trip, I felt left out from the group even though I have tried my best to participate and talk more to them. At the end of the trip, my group have organised a few outings. So far, I have given excuses not to join them because the thought of me being so awkward with them and being unable to talk much to them makes me dread the idea of going. 

They are organising an upcoming staycation which I want to go. However, I'm not sure if I should join them because I seriously think I'm not going to enjoy myself fully if I'm being so awkward with them.

For some reason that I cannot recall, I know that it never snows in Singapore. Instead, you get the occasional hailstorms. Do you Singaporeans carry special umbrellas for this? For example umbrellas made of kevlar which are so strong that  it can withstand the force of the hailstorm. How cold can it get in winter in Singapore? (I’d really appreciate if you can give me the temperature in fahrenheit)

I heard from some of my friends that Singapore is somewhat related to China in some way. Is swimming from Singapore to China a popular activity and if so which beach is popular for that? Is changi beach one of them? It appears to me from Google Maps that Changi beach is relatively closer to China that other beaches in Singapore. Roughly how far do I have to swim? (Again, a distance in feet is much appreciated :)

Last question:  I heard that you guys speak Singlish in Singapore instead of English.  You see, every time I go to a foreign country which speaks a foreign language, I always use Google translate. Makes my life so much easier with Google doing the translation. However, I am unable to find a language called Singlish on Google translate.  Can anyone help me with that?  Thanks mann in advance!

To OP's bf (not sure if you will read this post) / to interracial couples who face the same issue :

You need to figure out what you really want at the end of the day. If you want to be her life partner, fight for it then. Sometimes you need to learn to compromise in life, in exchange for lifetime happiness. 

If you are in her shoes, would you choose to convert out just for her? Please think from her position too. She has been living in non halal way for decades and you are now expecting her to convert. Please be fair to her. Since you can accept her being non chinese in the first, why cant you accept her for being non muslim? I believe you would not want to lose her because of religion, right? I understand that this is tough but be brave enough to find the life you want and courageous enough to chase it. If you lose her now, i do not know when you can meet someone you love and someone who love you back.

I was in your position before and i chose to respect my chinese wife' decision for not converting. We are now living happily for 6 years. At home, everything is halal. However, i respect her for eating non halal food when we are outside the house. As for my child, he follows my surname and is a free thinker. We will let him to choose his own religion when he grows up. All religions are the same. It teaches us to be a better person and to respect others.

So recently I started making bunch of new friends(mainly guys due to my nature) and I started hanging up with them in terms of like just play video games and chit chat.

So after awhile My boyfriend started getting so pissed because I started spending significant less time with him and he wants me to stop spending so much time with them. okay, fair, so I tried to squeeze some time for him and instead of playing with my friends and messaging them as often. I cut down a little and started to commit more and gave him a little bit more time but when I gave him more time he just wants even more. 

I just feel really stressed. Why can’t I just play with my friends more? Why can’t he be understanding? Sometime I just feel so controlled and stressful. 

Ik it’s unfair for him that I spend more time with other guys but it’s mainly messaging and sometime video games only and because of that.. sometime he asked what am I doing. I will just lied to him and say I’m doing nothing Or YouTube just because idw him to feel jealous. Am I wrong? What am I suppose to do?

My boyfriend and I are(?) together for a little over one year. We were doing well and all but I have never been able to tell him the things that I disliked about him; especially his behaviour and the way the treats me. But recently, I kinda snapped and dropped him a huge bomb of things that I have disliked about him. He took it quite negatively(he claims that I am tired of him???) and tbh I was hoping he would take the initiative to change his behaviour(he always scold me and rely on me on the the daily basis, literally. Felt more like his maid than his gf) because I really love him alot. But he said he refused to change because that is the way he is and he like himself that way. I was hoping that I was enough for him to change.. I am his first girlfriend and there are definitely many times where I felt love and appreciation from him. I tried to be an understanding girlfriend. Maybe my expectations were too high? Oh and he misunderstood that I am getting tired of him because I said that I was tired of his behaviour and the way he treats me. And he never ever admit his own mistakes, it is always me who apologised first. Moreover, he really sometimes give others bad impression of me because of the things he say about me in front of other people. If I were to tell him about his mistake, he would retaliate and push the blame to me instead. But nonetheless, he is pretty selfish and self centered at times but he have never failed to show me love in his own ways until recently. Honestly as I type this confession, I feel like he is a pretty shitty boyfriend but everyone is not perfect. I am sure I am not a perfect girlfriend either. 

Anyhow, as I've said he took things negatively, we 'broke up'. I was a sore loser and I couldn't let him go because he is really my partner and lover. I begged and cried for one more chance. Somehow I got that chance, but recently he told me that he is unsure of his feelings for me ever since that day I took my stuffs back and walked out of the house. So we decided to take a break and I want to give him some time(since he said that he needs time to get hold of his feelings for me again). 

I don't think it was wrong of me to express my feelings but it took a negative turn in our relationship. Do you guys think there is still a chance of rekindling our bond? I really don't want to stress him but I really miss him and the way we were last time. Is there any way that I can make him feel better? I feel sad and it really hurt me when he said he is unable to tell whether he still have feelings for me.. even I can't feel the love anymore. Any advice, please? No trollers please :(

I allowed my jealousy to engulf me and forced her to delete the pictured she had with her deceased ex. It was all kept in a folder on her Macbook. But she didn't, she started tearing up and apologising to me for not being able to fufil my wish instead. At that moment, as much as I pity her, I just can't control my anger and walked off.

Honestly, I don't know why am I so jealous about this no longer existent guy, but it just irks me that she constantly avoids things that she used to love. According to her sister and her friends, she used to love playing the guitar, eating prawn mee, watching volleyball matches, riding a bicycle etc. All of these were her hobbies that she used to do with her deceased ex and she doesn't do it now, as it simply reminds her of him. I know it is very heartbreaking for someone you'd loved to die in an accident and suddenly, you lost him in a blink of an eye, but I guess the devil inside me made me so harsh towards her and I'm so guilty.

Just yesterday, she texted me and I was rather happy because we haven't been texting for a week since that incident. However, it was a break up text. She dumped me. I know it's my fault but in the text, she kept apologising and taking all the blame. She mentioned that she isn't good enough for me and wished me atb.

To me, the prawn tail shells, paper at the bottom of the steamed baos, and pandas leaves all taste exotic to me. I respect this is your culture, and that’s why I try to go with the flow and try my best to enjoy the taste of these three things.

622,"Sorry for the incoming rant but I have a few questions regarding the online-dating landscape in singapore. For some context, I'm a male NUS student and recently I've been trying out the online-dating apps since it is the holidays. As the matches come in, I observe that singaporean girls that use these apps don't seem to be interested in dating at all. They either lead you into a never ending session of small talk or they do not even intend on meeting anyone in real life. 

In terms of chatting online, most either give uninterested vibes/short replies (even when we are matched) or are somehow blind/unresponsive to my carefully crafted/decent open ended questions (not hard questions at all). When it comes to meeting up in real life, they simply refuse to do so (when the point of dating apps is to arrange a date to not only learn about the other person in real life but to see if there is chemistry).  

While I agree that my view is bias, especially after wasting days of small talk, I feel that I am not understanding something about singaporean girls. Do singaporean girls go on dating-apps to boost their ego or are they simply just a tough nut to crack? What are the usual norms in online dating? In the mean time, the only nut I can crack is my own.

629,"As I was on my way home today, I was suddenly reminded of a failed relationship that happened years ago. 

I was young at 18 and I met him. We were so attracted to each other almost instantly. MSN was a thing that time, and we could chat for hours literally every single day. He asked me to be his girlfriend on Christmas Day and I said yes. This was despite knowing that he will be leaving the country in a year; he will be moving overseas and I am most definitely not. There were ups and downs throughout the relationship; it was not a healthy one. We were too young to know how to handle conflicts, and too immature to understand commitment. Among the things we talked about, we said that we would marry each other. At that time, it felt like he was ‘the one’, and he felt the same way too. Time wasn’t the kindest, we grew apart along with the physical distance. In the second year of the LDR, he told me one night that he was falling for someone else.. As immature as I was, I screamed. I was livid. I was heartbroken. Nothing could be done to rewind that moment, or mend that was already broken. I did all that stupid things: hung up on him then tried calling back, only to have my calls rejected; spammed him with lots of messages and received no replies; go from “f u” to a miserable apology... He blocked me eventually and through those days of silence, it was a chance to thoroughly examine myself. I learnt that there is no right or wrong in a breakup; relationship is a dance which takes two to tango. Anyone has the right to leave. He gave me a closure eventually, which I’m grateful for. He returned, we talked, and parted ways “officially”. As I re-look at an old diary, I’m surprised that today is exactly the 6th year since we parted. Perhaps this explains that weird feeling that I get today. 

To the brokenhearted, the rebuilding phase may be long and trying. It took me a full year before I was actually happy again. Do what you need to do, and I hope that you will find the way and the will to move onwards. Happy holidays.

631,"Just want to seek out some relationship advice here because I am afraid of messing up. Here goes.

I am currently a full-time student due to graduate within a year. I met my current (China) girlfriend 7 months ago and we have our ups and downs. We do enjoy each other's company and she seems to love me a lot.While I am her first boyfriend, she is not my first. She confessed to me after a few dates and we have been together since. The thing is, as much as I feel the need to care for her and look after her wellbeing, I do not feel a strong feeling of love to her nor anyone else, including my parents. I also do not feel strong emotions such as sadness. Is there such thing as being devoid of emotion ? I have been hurt deeply by a past relationship before, wondering if that could be the catalyst for the void? I tend to be very straightforward and tend not to be mindful of her feelings at times. However, I do apologise to her when I am in the wrong and attempt to make up for it by coaxing her with food. We also have different values but we try not to force them on each other. I see a future with her but I am afraid that the lack of 'love' for her may ruin everything.

1. I do want to be with her and spend my life with her but will such issues cause future problems between us, breaking the relationship?

We have quarrelled before such as why do I not do romantic things for her, post our pictures on social media (I have introduced her to my circle of friends and family), and a few other things along the lines of romanticism. Our sex life isn't that great because we do not engage in foreplay as she dislikes it. However, she frequently tries to initiate sex. 

2. Will this mismatch between us (love / sex life) cause problems in the future even though we are enjoying each other's company now?

She graduated recently and have started looking for a job. She intends to stay here with me but if she is unable to find a job here, she will return home. However, she does not believe in LDR and would rather that we break up if that becomes reality. I have assured her that even if we are in a LDR, we can make it work (video calls, travelling etc). The outlook doesn't seem optimistic to us, but I do not want the relationship to break apart because of uncontrollable factors.

3. Should I give up my 'freedom' to be with her in China or is there another way out?

I have a close colleague turned friend whom I have been talking to rather frequently since early this year. We have been out on a few occasions for dinner/meet up as well and also been overseas together for short trips. 

Initially, I did not have any feelings for; but overtime, I have started to realise that I might have developed some feelings (although I’m not entirely certain)- as I do find myself upset when he doesn’t text me for the day and missing him being around me. I myself would not really initiate any conversation as it’s just not me. We are no longer colleagues now but still keep in close contact. 

He has otherwise yet to show any signs that he would like to progress this friendship further. On the other hand, we don’t really talk about relationship issues. However on one occasion, I had briefly mentioned that I did not feel ready for one. 

Do you think it is right if I talked to him about this issue? I’m afraid that it might ruin our friendship and that I might just be the one overthinking? Is it normal for a guy to be so close to a girl? I feel like it is causing me to fall deeper by being so close to me. I’m afraid and confused.

I think your mindset is great, and there is definitely nothing weird or wrong about you.
However, as someone who also recently graduated and started working, and focuses abit more on the money aspect of the job, allow me to shed some light on to why some of us might behave so.
I graduated with close to 50k in student loan, with ~5% interest compounded monthly. Granted, i had to take up student loan because as a foreigner school fees is so much more expensive, but i know of local friends who cant afford the school fees after subsidies and have to pick up loan too.
My parents are retiring in 5 more years, and i still have 3 younger siblings who may have to depend on me to attend university.
Also, since i stay by myself, i also need to earn enough to cover my monthly rent.
Granted, my situation may be unique, not everyone is a foreigner or have younger siblings who may depend on them financially. However, my point is that while I thank God that you are fortunate enough to not bear responsibility for anyone aside your yourself and your dog, consider that many are less fortunate and the financial burden they bear may include more than that of themselves. Of course, nobody should be ashamed of their privilege, but it is well to be aware of it :)

Sucks to be you then. Your crush not doing anything bad must have made it harder for you to move on. 

Similarly, I confessed to my ex-close friend about 2 months after she's got cheated on. Less than a month after her break up, we got into a few arguments (as friends). Mainly due to me advising against her going onto dating apps so soon. On hindsight, someone this emotionally unstable and unappreciative of friendship really didn't deserve any help (she'd blocked me for a week just because I advised her to read some r/s books instead of going onto dating app). 

But the main story of this confession was that she didn't just reject me. She discussed her decision, at length, with another friend in our clique. That friend, whom I don't converse more than 3 days worth of words in a year, took this whole event as a laughing stock. Worse still, 
on that day after she'd rejected me, she proceeded in and said something along the line that I should get my closure by asking about why I was rejected. So, we basically went by a few hours of walking with me explaining which qualities of hers that I had fallen for. 

Anyway, OP of 73876, just be thankful. This is how emotion abuse is like. Some people can really exploit you thoroughly, squeezing every patience and Goodwill out of you for her own 感觉自我良好. For ending, I removed her from every aspect of my life, physically/digitally/etc. Ain't no time for this kind of toxic in my life.

I was really excited at first and we were having such a good time and everything until one of them asked me if I’m straight. I said I’m bi and made nothing of it, but then he whispered something to his friend and told me that she was interested in me. Next thing I know, the girl is grinding on me like mad and trying to put her hands in my pants to touch ku ku jiao. I even told her that I have a boyfriend in Singapore, but she wouldn’t leave me alone and I felt bad for rejecting her ????????????‍♂️.

I saw the messages between my gf of 3 years and another guy, 
pop up on her laptop.
All the juicy detail,
all the 'massages' 
that they give each other. 
The love confessions 
front and back at each other,
Like lovebirds, who have found each other.
All that, over the weekends. 
No wonder, why she never came home. 
After our last arguments, and off she went.
All my messages,
became double blue ticks.

Today,

My heart is shattered,
to a thousand pieces.
My chest tightened, pushing out all the air in my lungs.
My clenched fists, looking for something to smash.
My persistent coughing, which had lasted for a few days
suddenly healed. As if there is another pain
Excruciating pain. That nothing can match.

I want to scream, but out came nothing.
I want to cry, but no tears flowing.
All that lies within,
is now, 
emptyness.

Today,

I have realised. 
Love is blind,

And nothing lasts forever.
3 years went by,
blood, joy, sweat, tears.
""Let's travel around the world together""
she said.

But I think, With whatever sanity I have left,
to reckon.
There is a silver lining in every sad story.
She may have found true love.
While I, starting every thing
all over again.

So, an incident broke the camel's back and nearly made E and I fall out, all because her boyfriend was being socially dense. Said boyfriend apologised for his actions in that incident but the apology sounded like ""I do not find myself in the wrong but I am apologising for the sake of apologising & E asked me to do so."" 
That attempt in apology diminished any form of reconciliation; I blue-ticked his apology. E also wanted me and her boyfriend to be netural towards each other. Furthermore, the friends in that circles also said that I should forgive him. 
I can't do it because the revelation of his prejudice and his apology was anything but sincere and thoughful. I felt hurt, knowing that I was treated differently from E's other friends since the very beginning and was uncertain if I should forgive him for the sake of the camaraderie of the social circle. Deciding to prioritise E's happiness in her marriage life over my decade-long friendship with her, I decided to avoid putting her in social situations where she had to choose between her boyfriend and me, because I knew she would be stressed having to pick between the both of us. However, that further strained the friendship and both of us were apparently suffering because she knew what I was doing about it, according to a friend. Said friend also said that the boyfriend ""wanted to make amends but OP was not letting him to."" It has been a year since the incident happened.
The question is: was I being unreasonable for not forgiving her boyfriend? Was I wrong to prioritize E's happiness with him over our decade-long friendship?

So basically last Saturday I went to confront one of the “guy friends” of hers which I assume he likes her. 
I’m unsure how to explain this but when u saw a guy you can just tell that he actually likes your girl as a friend or with motives just by the way he looks at her. You just can tell. (Victim herself probably couldn’t and keep coming up with lies and well idk or she just love the attention of guys.)

Anyway I confronted him despite my girlfriend previously keeps claiming they just “friends” and he have no motives. Guess what? I was right he told me in the face that he likes my girlfriend and his willing to break his current gf to be with her. YEAH break his “current gf” to be with “my gf.” I almost punch the guy in the face seriously cannot take this anymore.. but fine at least I have an answer now that I was right all the way.

Anw Sunday I manage to get my gf out for HTHT again but face to face this time round instead of calls or messages. And I told her all this so basically she was shocked as she doesn’t believe me because she think boy girl friendship exist. (Totally fine they do, just rarely or I think so)

Anyway after telling her all this she somehow still doubt me and think that I'm making it up.
So yeah I did what guys should do instead of continuing be in this pain I broke up with her. (Really wish I recorded the freaking convo to confront her making her speechless)

Well at least now i no longer have to suffer this pain of neglecting, under prioritised  and heartache.

Thanks y’all for support.

The weather is so cold in Singapore these few days, yet the water coolers around the school are still dispensing ice cold water. Isn’t this a blatant waste of electricity? We should just turn all the power sources off. Even better if it can be kept off till the end of next semester. And I haven’t got to the aircon being blasted at full speed in rooms where few students are using during this vacation.

After all, Singapore water is drinkable from the tap, we don’t need any filter machine or boiled water in order to drink the water. Just turn the water cooler off, we can still get drinkable water.

I am an incoming exchange student from the UK. I know that Singapore is a very developed country, but there is something that I have been unable to wrap my head around. I have a question about the drinking water supply in Singapore.

I heard that Singapore uses waste water (a.k.a. “s**t water”) as one of its source of water supply. May I know if nus is located in one of the districts which uses this waste water? If the answer is yes then I’ll make sure I buy bottled water every day I’m here. 

Additionally, may I know how do you use these waste water for your daily needs? Specifically at which step of the water do you withdraw waste water from to shower, wash clothes etc? For example, if I want to obtain water to shower, should I scoop water out from the toilet reservoir, toilet bowl, or pipes beneath the sink?

Thank you in advance, and I look forward to seeing all of you in Singapore!

NUS should implement a ""chickenisation"" programme. Give a chicken to every student at the start of next semester. Teach every student how to raise a chicken and learn about discipline. At the same time wean them off their mobile phone addiction. If our neighbouring country can do something like that to their fourth grade students, why can't we?

I've had some eye candies that I stole a look at when I was in school, but that's about it. I know I will never be as good as others, in terms of looks, body, intelligence and charisma. I know I cannot be on par with others, the straight or the gay. 

This makes me believe I'm destined to be alone forever. Don't get me wrong, it's not that bad. I don't have to worry about other expenses but mine. I don't have to worry about fluctuating emotions or conflicts I see in my attached friends. Yet somehow, I sometimes feel a bit left out. 

When I'm a bit depressed or having a rough day, I thought of confiding to someone, to rant to someone and to tell someone what happened. To my family, sure I can do that, but sometimes they don't get what I'm going through. Parents will tend to compare how tenacious and strong they were in the past and compare themselves to us in an encouraging way, but it sometimes irks me to be compared to a generation not being faced with shifting changes and technological advancements almost everyday. Hard work like how it used to be in the past does not guarantee results already. It's different now and I feel exasperated trying to explain to my family what I am facing.

To friends, sure why not. They are my generation. Once or twice it's ok, but I sometimes get a feeling that they are bored or just disinterested in what I'm saying. They can provide a listening ear, but the lack of connection is still there.

I don't know how it feels go confide to a partner. I've heard many around me that when they have something they want to share, the first person they talk to is almost always their partner. They talk, laugh, cheer each other on. I feel that they are being loved and cherished, romantically of course. I sometimes yearn for this relationship, to find someone in the crowd that understands and cares for me. 

Yet somehow, I know I'm not good enough no matter how hard I try, and it's not just because of my sexual orientation, but because it's just me. Plain old me.

654,"Graduated 1 year ago. Feeling lost and confused now. Having quit my first job after a few months in it because of some internal matters that drove me semi crazy, I found myself working in a job now that demands high tolerance and patience. I know what many of you will say, that which job doesn't have its own problems. 

Mine is that I feel this job does not have prospects. It doesn't allow me to learn much. Sure the information is abundant and keeps changing every half year, but ultimately the whole cycle repeats itself. To be honest, my own patience is running thin in this job, having to deal with unreasonable people and demands from others. What seems like an obvious answer to me does not seem like one for the others, and I don't mean my colleagues, but the ones that we are providing service to. It's nothing technical at all, the people just need to be more independent, aware and abide to rules that's all. Yet somehow, they can't, and we come in to sort of clean up the mess.

But without the problems there won't be jobs for us right? I agree. But we still have to deal with a lot of backlog and spill overs even when we enter the March or April period, and it's the start of another cycle. And these issues have almost nothing to do with the problems that people come to us to resolve. Everyday we anticipate issues that are out of this world, unheard of and sometimes weird, even after being with us for so long people can still forget or commit the same mistakes. How do we become a tech savvy society when people cannot even search for stuff? It's not python or JavaScript, it's not MATLAB or Solidworks, it's just putting effort to familiarise with the online environment and know what to do.

Adding to this repetitive cycle of shit taking and blame shirking to us is the inability of our higher ups to know what is going on on the ground. They want more results, higher percentage, and tend to like quantitative rather than qualitative. And when we don't meet their expectations, they will comment like it's not part of their jobs to find out what is going on. Why is this service like this? Why are there so little cases resolved? Maybe it's because of the rules set in place? 

I feel out of place here. I feel that I'm not myself and I want to get out. But I can't.

Today I discovered a Facebook vlog page that shows the British vlogger trying to get free food and services by making lies, fake claims and so on. And it seemed to have worked everytime, everywhere, from getting free MacDonalds meal in the US to getting free entries to luxury hotels. So the comments are always divided between people condemning him and people who supports it. 

For me, I think what he is doing is no different than the Caucasian begpackers, basically trying to get food/lodging/services for free by offering nothing in return. While I was in Europe, I always explore the small towns including those non-touristy spots and it is difficult getting service even though I speak the local language (not very fluent but understandable), usually they brush you off by making you wait unnecessarily long or just simply saying they’re on their last order, yet you see people walking in.

662,"To #73850 and other eczema sufferers: (a long post ahead)

I'm suffering from eczema as well and can understand the mental and emotional turmoil. Sharing my experience since my last flare up was more than half a year ago and my condition has been stable except when I tried to be funny by eating foods I shouldn't be eating.

Please try not to apply steroid creams even when dermatologists tell you to because it only suppresses the symptoms and does not treat the underlying cause. However, when you first stop your steroid intake, you'll probably experience what they call Topical Steroid Withdrawal. It's a horrible experience but it'll be alright after you go through this phase. To lessen the pain when you bathe, do not use the typical bath shampoo but use bath oil. For me, I use Oatmeal Bath Oil from Derma**** by applying it before I wet my body with water. It does help to lessen the pain from the open wounds.

I was also told that we have flare ups because there is something wrong with the body, like our liver is overworked while detoxifying our body. So one of the best ways to counter this is to have a cleaner diet by trying to abstain or lower your intake of certain foods which can trigger your eczema. Certain foods include high histamine food, night shades, dairy and nuts. Also try to avoid preservatives and processed foods.

Finally, if possible, get supplies of antihistamines like Zyrtec from a polyclinic to help with the itch (cold presses help too). Very cliche to say to stop scratching.. but it's really a need to break the scratch itch cycle that I still cannot do.. Now that NSC is conducting a clinical trial for a new drug, I hope it helps all of us eczema sufferers. :)

The compensation for this role is pretty much the same as Software Engineers. Most of my peers have received around 4+ to 7k as fresh graduates. Despite the hype for CS and S.E., many other roles in Tech are much better in Singapore in terms of compensation, working hours and responsibility - UX roles being one of them.

I realise people misunderstood when I said stay with locals in a share house. I stayed with the British students of the local UK uni not Singaporean locals.

DONT STAY WITH SINGAPOREANS IN A PRIVATE APARTMENT!! 

That's what happened to the large group of Singaporeans who went to Sheffield uni and stayed together. It's more difficult to mix with the British students. You'll regret it. 


The Singaporean student who stayed on campus had other exchange students living next door. Tbh, it's fun to meet other intl students but they kinda stuck to their own clique from their home countries. Most are Erasmus students with 3-5 min coming from each European country. They all know each other.

Travelling to Europe because air tickets from London to other European countries are cheap? I stuck to UK, went to other cities in UK by train. But if you want to go around to Paris, Venice etc, yes, ticket is cheap. Who's gonna pay for the Airbnb, travelling within the city, food, sightseeing? Food is very expensive and you'd be so grateful for our foodcourts.

Studying full time in London? That's a lot of money and a great experience if you want to mix with intl students. But sticking to smaller cities like Manchester, Liverpool, Nottingham allow you to mingle with the average British person.

I stand by my statement. London is expensive. An exchange is a wonderful exposure and I hope those with less money go for exchange. It is possible to go for exchange to UK, just go to a smaller city.  Get the 4K bursary to pay for flight and accomodation for 5 months and your own personal savings to spend.

Then things got better when i realised the causal factors and adjusted my lifetstyle. Poor diet, lack of sleep and stress. You have to make sure you eat healthily and exercise.

Avoid Junk food, especially sugary stuff. They cause inflammation, which will make your body want to expel those nasty stuff expeditiously, through the largest organ of your body, the skin. Hence the rash.

Get enough sleep. Your body needs to rejuvenate and recover. Dont stress too much over stuff, health is more important. Exercise. All the best.

So this guy I met from dating app just held my hands while we were walking, and he didn’t say anything about asking me to me his Girlfriend. 

We had met up for dates for two months and there were good vibes between us. He mentioned previously he would like to bring the relationship as far as he could. 

My question is are we together now that he held my hands? I’m not sure how to ask him about our status and his commitment. From our last conversations, I inferred that he was looking for a serious relationship (so I don’t think think it’s a fling) and our values (like family and honesty) seemed to align. Yet, I would like to be sure by hearing it from him. I would like to ask him but I don’t want to give the impression that I’m pushing for a status. 

What does it mean when’s a guy holds your hands? He is pretty introverted and can be a man of few words, and never had a relationship before.

Hello! I was in a similar situation as you. The only difference is my mom won’t insult me but I did reach a point where even she agrees that I needed to do something about my tummy fats at 162cm 53kg.

At that time, I started dating as well. So I started spending money on slimming products, do core exercises (not knowing there is no such thing as spot reduction) and running sometimes. Slowly, I learn more and I know what to do. I’ve reached 46kg now.

I understand the mental and emotional struggle because I was being insulted at by my sis too :( She would say mean things to me and I was very affected sometimes. I was NOT fat. I am skinny fat. My arms and legs are slim but my tummy is fat. However, someone told me to view negative comments positively, try seeing the insult as a motivation to prove what you can achieve. At first I thought, that person doesn't understand me. It's not so easy to do it and I will not be happy to go on a diet and I don't like to exercise. But I keep reminding myself to be positive.

In a desperate attempt to slim down. I purchase a popular product called SoSlim from Fashion Shelter (@fashionshelter on Instagram). It's very expensive but I was desperate and no harm trying from so many positive reviews + it is locally approved. This product works, no dieting or exercising needed but process is slow. Results are evident but super slow. This is based on personal experience though. In 1 week, I lose 2cm around my waist and 1cm around my thigh.

Slowly, I incorporated some core exercises like leg raise, crunches and plank. I run once to twice per month and do 10-20 minutes hula hoop every night. I did cut down about 1 kg after doing this for about 1 month.

Later on, I read articles about dieting. It is true that 70% is on dieting and 30% on exercising. Yes, it's so frustrating to finally acknowledge this but I was determined to slim down (especially I want to wear nicer clothes and I found out that my bf likes slimmer girls, that doesn't mean you should slim down for other people, do it for yourself to look good feel good). I read about intermittent fasting, this is eating in a 8 hours window in a day. But I thought, 8 hours is too less for me so I try to eat within 10 hours window. My weight significantly dropped but I didn't keep track though. I tried caloric deficit too. Meaning, I consume lesser calories than what I burn or something like that. I'd make sure my calories intake in within 1200 per day and I used MyFitnessPal to keep track. Wasn't happy about counting calories all the time though..

WARNING: I ate lesser and tried to skip breakfast too. One day I ate too much at 10pm, the next day, I had a very bad episode of gastric pain and was admitted into the hospital. So don't eat tooooo full suddenly if you go on a diet.

While doing all these, I continued using SoSlim. I had manage to cut to 48kg in about 3 months. I tried going gym after that. My bf helped me a lot when I decided that I want to try weightlifting. Gym is intimidating for me but I overcame it and going with someone helps a lot too. I am currently doing a few of these in the gym: Romanian deadlift, glutes kickback, cable pull (not sure what this is called but I used this to target glutes), barbell squats, abs bench and the same core exercises. I went for a run once a week as well and my weight dropped to about 47.5kg and I was stuck at around that weight for some time (this is NORMAL).

As I start to gym, I started dieting as well. Sounds awful right? Indeed it is but not soooo bad. I stopped counting calories after knowing roughly how much I should consume a day. After the gastric episode, I eat breakfast now. A small bun or anything small is good. Lunch I'd eat normally and anything I want but LESS rice or noodle. Once 80% full, I'll stop. So when I dabao, I'll said LESSS rice / noodle. Make sure there is a meat, vegetable and something else. Dinner I'll go for mixed veg rice WITHOUT rice. Usually I'll order chicken, egg and vegetables. I hate vegetables but I'm forcing myself to eat along with something I like which is chicken and egg. No keto diet because I love rice. Lesser snacking on chips too. No fast food too (one per three months is okay). Lesser sweet drinks too but milo is my weakness XD I'd still snack and eat something sweet still though, like a treat for myself HAHA

Lastly, I was stuck at 47.5kg for some time so I tried taking Apple Cider Vinegar for a week. Didn't see significant drop but I stopped after 1 week and I can see my weight starting to drop again. After resting for 2 weeks, I started drinking for another week along with SoSlim, gym, and careful diet, I finally reached to where I am now at 46kg. I am actually already underweight. However, at this weight, my belly fat is still there. I can't wear tight dress without looking nice at my tummy area. My tummy is totally NOT flat at all. It is still flabby. I'm saying this not to discourage you but I want to emphasize that it takes a long time, give yourself a year. Don't give up! Sometimes it's okay to slack for a week but you have to continue. The reward is that I am able to wear tighter shorts/skirt hehehe

It's 1am so pardon my english XD PM me if you want to know more, I'm willing to help because I understand and I hope to motivate some girls out there! I took pictures of my tummy throughout my journey as well and the difference is significant. PM me too if you wanna see XD All girls out there, love yourself, love your body. Please take care even if you want to slim down to look good okies

679,"I've talked to a few of my male friends and they faced similar problems. I'm 22m, from SoC, currently on exchange in Europe. 

One of the things that local students sometimes ask is about my time in NS. I would talk about NS with fellow NS men as it was a common experience, and learning about other vocations is quite interesting. But I felt uncomfortable when the local students ask me questions about it. I couldn't use military jargon and acronyms, and had to keep explaining boring details that most Singaporeans would know about.  Why can't the locals understand that it's not fun to talk about our experience because it's just a one-sided explanation of how our nation's defence works? Talking about it with the local students felt like I was giving a lecture, so I regularly steer away from the topic. 

So because I don't like talking about it, I guess I gave a disinterested vibe whenever they ask about it. Most of them didn't take this too kindly and that's where the problems begin. Over lunch one day, I was with a group of 4 locals and another exchange student. The topic of military life came up, and I gave short responses when asked. The local students initially tried to squeeze more answers out of me, but I continued giving short responses so one of them snapped at me and said along the lines of ""Why are you so aloof when we ask you about your time in the military? Do you think you're better than us because you served?"". I was stunned, so I looked to the others in the group for affirmation, but they seemed to agree with what he said. No one stopped him or asked him to calm down, like they all felt the same way as he did.

Back in Singapore, people shared fun stories and it's okay to occasionally interrupt to ask questions if we get too technical, especially when girls are around. But even then, most Singaporean girls would know of the basics of NS. Why can't the locals understand that Singaporeans don't like to talk about NS unless we're sharing interesting stories? Was it wrong of me to be disinterested when the topic arises? I still answered their questions, I just didn't elaborate like they expected me to. What do you guys think?

680,"I saw a post earlier on dealing with severe eczema and i want to share my story as well. I also had eczema since i was born. I am not sure why but as i get older my eczema got worser. My skin is super thin and red, and although i try my best not to scratch, it is super difficult to fight against the itch. As my skin is so fragile, simply scratching it for a few seconds will cause the skin to tear, bleed and weep(production of clear fluid). My entire body is filled with scratch wounds making it hard for me to even perform normal daily activities. I dread bathing everyday as the pain is unbearable. Imagine bathing with knife cuts all over your body. Also, when u wake up, imagine seeing your entire bed filled with skin and blood. Sometimes even walking is painful as the skin will be pulled on. Even though eczema is not directly life threatening compared to other more serious  illness but it really causes a lot of pain both physically and emotionally. We are insecure when we go out due to our skin. When the skin condition is super bad it is so painful and uncomfortable that we cannot even leave the house. Eczema is also triggered by the sun, heat, sweat, dust and stress so we cannot participate in any outdoor activities as well. Because of my severe eczema  i did not participate in any orientation activities and other activities so i do not really have friends in uni. Due to the bad skin condition it also hard for me to approach others and be friends without being judged. Also, the medication we have to take have harmful side effects as well which just takes a huge toll on our health. All in all, severe eczema is a really painful medical condition to suffer from. It is not just a case of having itchy skin which many who do not have the condition perceive. Sometimes i wonder will the pain end when i die?
 
My eczema flared recently due to stress from all the projects submissions and finals. This makes me realize that health is actually more important than studies. There is no point having good grades if our health is terrible. With poor health we cannot even go on with our normal activities much less work.  Though we are caught in a rat race it would be good if we all can slow down and appreciate the finer things in life like our own health and family. 

To those suffering from eczema or other severe illnesses lets hope everything will be better soon and press on! :)

684,"This is a reply to UK sem exchange student in #73815 , just some more feedback for others planning to do an exchange in London. I've been studying in London for 1.5 sems (full-time there) now, not planning to start an argument but can't say I agree with everything OP said- so I'm sharing my different perspective so others going to the UK can choose and decide.

3. 'Don't be a scared Singaporean and stay in campus halls.. I stayed with 2 locals students.' : I think that staying in campus halls and interacting with intl students is really important if you want to experience the 'true London student life'. The richest part of London is its diversity. I'd say being 'scared' is actually staying in our comfort zone and staying with Singaporeans- on the flipside, stay on a campus accomodation, be BRAVE and interact with the intl students! You'd be surprised how much you learn about different cultures, which you CANNOT experience in SG (what's the fun in staying with Singaporeans when you've known them your whole life?)
4. Pick up cooking some basic things, invest in a frying pan and a boiler or a rice cooker. Big money saver. It's easy to start of with the basics such as boiling vegetables and frying chicken- if you can survive army food (guys), you can survive your own cooking :)
6. '6. Don't need to travel the entire Europe just because youre in the UK. Take your semester to immerse fully and enjoy the British life. London isn't the only place to visit.' : I strongly DISAGREE. Budget air tickets to European cities from London are even cheaper than train tickets from London to English cities! If you know how to find them. You'll be missing out on so much if you don't take advantage of prices like 20 pounds to Prague etc- it'll cost over 50 times more to fly from Singapore! I think OP seriously missed a trick here- check out the prices of EasyJet, RyanAir etc. There's a lot more to experience being in different cities with different languages rather than just travelling where everything is in English.
7. Unless you've lots of money, choose to do exchange outside of London. London is at least twice of other cities for everything. : I agree on the money, BUT I'd also argue London is much more exciting and there's lots more to do compared to other English cities. For me the you can do 3 times more things to do compared to most other English cities which are way quieter. British people living in other cities all see London as some sort of 'paradise' (Think Seoul for Koreans living in small cities) where they tend to gravitate there - if costs allows. I'd say in terms of VALUE per experience, London is actually higher - the richness of international culture and vibrancy from London isn't matched anywhere else in the UK (it doesn't even come close), and that is in itself invaluable.

Just my 2 cents, I agree different people may have different perspectives but it's always good to share so there isn't just a single 'right' view. Comments would be appreciated..

686,"To be honest, being an ex NUS student and working in the private education sector, the disparity between full time and part time students is very very big. The attitude and behaviour differ. Google was my best friend, and still is now. I remembered searching for information first and made sure I couldn't find anything, before sending out an email query. I made sure to submit assignments on time. I remembered knowing what to do, and checked my emails and ivle regularly for new information. 

For part time students, let's just say their preferred source of information is a phone call. I once asked my colleague, why do they call in first even before searching for information that is available online? Wouldn't that save them more time? My colleague just shook her head and said, take it in, keep calm and always think this way, they are part time students. Keep thinking, part time part time. 

So now I'm hypnotising and psychoing myself with this to not get too emotional when a call comes in every few minutes to ask about something that can be found online.

And this is not even counting how tough it is to make friends as it is. I'm feel like I'm putting in way more effort to keep in contact with people that I meet and get going with, to the extent that I'm the one starting every conversation (not too frequently so that it's not annoying). It wouldn't hurt to drop your friends a text once in a while to catch up would it? I've always prioritised friends over everything else, and would always go out of my way to make sure that the friendships last, such that even if there is an exam the next day, I'll set aside the day time for friends, and just not sleep in the night so that I can maintain both my studies and friendships.

695,"TL;DR: On exchange, friends take advantage of me and a few others because we choose peace over drama. Can't figure out if it is my problem or my friends are just being an ass. Would you all leave such toxicity behind and live your own life, or try to give in more even though you had tried your best to be understanding in unreasonable situations. Where is humanity? 

I am a NUS FASS student currently on exchange at the US with 12 other friends from NUS. A few friends of mine took advantage of me during this exchange trip because I tend to place others before myself. There are times I know two to three of them are taking advantage of me, yet I choose to not rebut just to maintain peace. However, I am beginning to burn out and feel that there is a problem with myself. 

When things need to be completed, I tend to be disciplined and stick to the timetable I have set for myself. Such as missing a few drinking sessions just to catch up on my work or apply for internships. Hence, this act of mine may be seen as ""not cool"". Also, ever since I got offered an internship position 2 months back, a close friend of mine who is on this exchange with me has been sarcastic and mean towards me. It just gets worse each day. 

Another guy A was discriminated by them due to the fact that they feel guy A is ""uninteresting"". However, this is really subjective and a few of us beg to differ.

Girl B then got ostracized after they feel that she is sensitive and uptight. 

Now, it is my turn because one of them made a false claim on me and I confronted her. In her defence, she said it was a 'joke'. However, how can someone be so petty over this small matter? Also, I thought we are all adult enough to talk it out. She refuses to speak to me and avoided me for weeks. 

It's always that few outspoken-extroverts that go on gossiping and ostracize people,  and the few intermediaries that choose to remain silent to maintain peace. Where is humanity? Why can't people just be kind?

702,"Hey #83772

Hi there, I decided to respond to your qn: what ruins a healthy long term relationship

Anonymously. Because I want to be truthful.

Truth is, a lot of “luck” is involved. Yes you read that right. 

I for one have a child and a loving wife. We are married for more than ten years. But there were so many times the stability which I built everything upon (condo, career, car, etc) was so easy to just recklessly abandon to my “luck” of attracting the attention of someone of the opposite sex I could only have dreamed of. 

Of course I will do no evil to destroy what good I have built for myself any my family. Yes I sound irresponsible to even mention it but it is that easy to ruin a long term relationship. Because it feels like “luck” than “misfortune”. 

How do you avoid this? You can’t. You simply have to possess a very rewarding relationship to the point it makes little “economical” sense to abandon your stable relationship. I find that treasuring a long term relationship is much harder than short ones because we take “today” for granted. Cannot have dinner today? Nvm tmr. Cannot go holiday this year? Nvm next yr. You will be around me wat. 

No no no. Never assume. 

One golden rule I learnt is that I should never look at a relationship based on months or years, but just today. Am I happy with the relationship? Am I contributing to the relationship? What can I do about it? But I never question if the other party is contributing to the relationship. Because if that is actually a question in your head, YOU GOT THE WRONG PERSON MATE. Really, you have no control over how much the other half contributes to the relationship. It is like an “inborn” thing that cannot be tutored or nagged into the brain. So naturally, this gives you a good hint on what to look for in a potential partner in a long term relationship: a person who is constantly finding ways to contribute to the relationship WITHOUT PROMPT from you. Seems rare to find such a person and if you do, it cannot be ruined right? WRONG. It is a lot easier to take for granted and even easier to ruin than an unrewarding relationship. Because we do take good things for granted. 

How easy it is to ruin a long term relationship even when both are deeply invested in the relationship? Here are some tried and tested tricks from my divorced friends:

A sacarstic tease here, a spurt of “bloody fool” or “lazy pig”, a wall of anger with a few “don’t even touch me” day here and there, a few rant of complaints doubting the loyalty of your better half spilled to mutual friends... the sort that you tell everyone except your other half, etc.... these can really build up over time and sometimes “luck” just checks in to see how you are- and becomes the hay that breaks the camel’s back. 

Let me tell you about this “luck”. I call it “luck” because that is exactly how it feels when you are at the maginot line of self-destruction. 

When you build yourself up like a fortress, you do “luckily” attract attention of the... sexual kind. It can come from varying sources but because they are “by chance” moments it is always easier to say no than to succumb to it. But really easier said than done when the initiating party gets bolstered by your confusion and advances steadily. I hate myself for letting my imagination run wild sometimes and I usually dive deeper into my work to stop the nonsense spilling into reality. I have also developed a wall of party tricks to avoid these disasters because I really value the loyalty of my wife and I believe she deserves nothing less. 

Some of my friends weren’t so lucky. So which sex more guilty one ah? is it husband or wife more? Nowadays sama-sama. How old are the relationships? Got kids involved, in primary schools. Terrible when you think, but really, in the eyes of the beholder, they were simply rationalizing a strode of “luck” that fell on their lap. 

I never even put money/debt or sudden health issue (e.g. car accident) or nasty relatives (the sibling who always come and spill trouble) into the equation and long term relationship is already so easy to ruin. 

So treat every relationship that comes to you as fragile as a wine glass. It will bring you happiness when the daily grind ends with a free flow of “wine” falling from the sky every night without fail (“wine” here refers to a satisfying happiness which stability brings at the end of the day). Those who have glass will fill it to the brim and sip over supper with their partner. 

But if you meet people that likes to smash your glass into pieces all the time? Well you just gotta find someone mature enough to enjoy a glass of wine every night, not a berzerker who smashes your life and hopefully he/she can be tamed someday to do this long term relationship thing. A few sips of this “free” wine really change your life and show you how beautiful life can be when savored in its simplest elements as a reflection of your memories.

Was trying to follow up with you over the years to rearrange a meet up with you. Previously when you did the survey for me, understand you are looking more into medical and retirement plans. Would you be available to meet for a short while this month for me to share with you on these areas?

Me: am i reading this wrong? Dec 2014?

Agent: Yes Dec 2014. You did a survey for me at Raffles Place, at that time you said you were working as a xxxxx in a xxxxx

Me: lunch on you if we meet. deal?

Agent: Sure no problem
Agent: would next weekday lunch be good for you?

Me: ok what kind of timing are you looking at... also before we meet and you may consider it a waste of your time and money, i'm not really looking for any plans
Me: so you can say no, if you feel that it would be a fruitless meeting

Agent: Oh do u want to look into the medical and retirement plans? Thought you are keen to find out more thus I dont mind meeting you

Me: i don't really have any idea what medical and retirement plans are. because to begin with i don't really have any insurance except the group insurance with AVIVA 
Me: so if you are asking me if i'm keen, i can't really say because i don't really have any idea what they are
Me: but to be frank, i don't have any inclination to buy any plans if that's what you are asking
Me: just being frank before having you treat me lunch

Agent: If you don't mind me asking, is there a reason why you do not know about medical and retirement plans? And more importantly, are you open to know about them? I'm okay to meet you if you have no intention of buying a plan, no obligation anyway ???? But if you feel that you are not open to listening or finding out about it, then maybe we can touch base again next time when you're keen.

Me: I don't understand your question. Why would you think I'll go find out about medical plans or retirement plans?

Agent: Oh when you did the survey for me, there were questions on medical, insurance, investments and retirement. You selected medical and retirement, thus I focus on these two. Previously trying to arrange with you to discuss on these areas. But then again, so many years already ????
Agent: No worries then. you have my number, you can call me anytime if you have any questions. Have a good week!

I was kinda in your phase a few years back haha. I had a few dates that ditched me because I was boring btw hahaha. But I think it’s the fact that we don’t vibe well lol.

For k-pop, if you’re willing to, I’m sure you can find fellow stans who are more than happy to make friends with you. 

Personally, I have a friend from back then that I still contact sometimes through k-pop. I also know of some people who became best friends through this ???? Since you like k-pop, you might also have a Twitter account. Maybe that’s where you can start. 

It’s a relatively smaller community these days (imo) but at least it should not be too far out from your comfort zone. For now, you can leverage on that to find friends of the same hobbies for now ????????????

Once you’re more comfortable, you can push yourself to other social situations ???? Such as Meet-Up (still be cautious!) or any activities in school that you might be interested ????

712,"<Warning: long post ahead about my childhood and grief>

In my childhood, I saw my aunt (my mother’s younger sister) as my second mother. My parents didn’t have much time for me as they both held demanding jobs, my father works in an MNC and my mother was in banking. Since I was 3 years old, I lived with my grandmother on the weekdays and I spent certain weekends with my aunt or she’d visit me at my grandma’s house. 

I remember the times I spent at her place tending to the mini vegetable garden outside her house, baking desserts in her kitchen and numerous outings. My aunt compiled a photo album for the many photos we took during the time we spent together. She also made me promise to confide in her, and if there’s anything I didn’t want my mother to know, I could go to her. 

As she and her husband were childless then, I secretly wished that she was my mother instead. It wasn’t till I was 8, when my mother became a housewife and I began living with my parents (and forged a strong relationship with them since). Still, I remained close to my aunt. Every CNY I looked forward to seeing her most, often finding ourselves talking for hours 1-to-1 until it was time to leave.

In JC, I came home from school and my mum told me my aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer. She ate very healthily, exercised, and ensured the whole family that she was feeling better each day. However, within 3 years she lost a lot of weight, just skin and bones. She was wheelchair-bound (she called it her batmobile) towards the last several months of her life.

At the beginning of 2015 (Y1S2), my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer too, and I cried really hard at the hospital because I was afraid of the possibility of losing her. A few months later (Y2S1), my mum undergone a major surgery. I was very worried, crying my eyes out, praying that she won’t die. My aunt suggested that I stay over at her place so that she could comfort me with “warm soup and hugs” (her exact words). I declined the offer as I was studying for finals and that was the worst decision I made in my life.

My aunt died a few weeks later, which shocked me deeply. I stared into blank space for an hour outside her ward as the whole family sorted out her funeral. When my other aunts tidied her home, they found the photo album from my childhood that she’s been keeping all these years. My grandma said my aunt told her that she flips through my childhood album once in a while. I like to believe that perhaps back then she wished that I was her daughter too.

Over the next 2 semesters, my grades suffered and I questioned the purpose of life, falling into depression. I cried almost every night for around 5 months in the privacy of my bedroom so my parents wouldn’t know. Eventually, I got better with counselling, my parent’s support and my CCA commitments. My mother also recovered from cancer.

Today (13 Dec) marks the 4th anniversary since my dear aunt died. Not a day goes by that I don’t think about her. I still cry occasionally when I miss her (like right now as I am writing this). I realized how short life is and I am immensely grateful that my mother is alive today because I think I’d lose the will to live if she had died too.

The Silent Generation thinks that their boomer children can be disrespectful and entitled too. My mum often talks back rudely to my granddad while inculcating in me the values of respecting your elders since young. I mean, if both your predecessor and successor generations have issues with your generation it means its just your generation and there's really something wrong with it, isn't it?

Made this post after my dad commented that we young people are weak and can never understand the hardship that made boomers tough. My granduncle then savagely dismissed his comment with an ""OK Boomer, what hardship?"" and then proceeded to talk about his childhood experiences of surviving the Japanese occupation, while questioning if the comfortable and peaceful times that my dad went through could even be considered as hard as compared to hiding in canals and living on sweet potatoes.

I've seen too many relationships fail and i really dont understand why 

What you advice you can give to someone looking for a relationship?

And 

What exactly ruins a healthy long term relationship? 

If i were to answer my question;
Expectations of your partner is the only problem. And the best partner one that has nothing to offer but love. Someone who isn't the most goodlooking, someone who doesn't have money to give, someone who doesn't have time to spare. If they have nothing to give but love, you won't spend your relationship expecting things from your partner and getting upset. I'd say it is possible to love without giving anything. 

What do you think?


P.S. I think the non-NUS commenters often give great relationship advice (other than the few that have nothing meaningful to say).

I was given an ultimatum to complete a detailed list of all of my work within less than a day as I was informed at night and they wanted it the morning after. If not, they threatened to give me a bad reference to all my future employers. As I tendered right on the date where I’m able to get my bonus, they also told me that my bonus will decrease because of my departure. 

Is there anyone who has been through something similar and how did you deal with handling such unprofessional people? I’ve thought of going to MOM but that is more on wages rather than workplace harassment.

I can no longer look into the mirror without feeling sad, even though my friends try to encourage me and say that I look skinny.

When I try to buy clothes for myself, she would either say it’s ugly or I look fat in it. And I would feel like crying and have no mood to shop, which is probably why I have limited clothes in my closet. It’s so hard to love myself, what should I do?

Recently, I feel like my partner has become complacent in the relationship, a few months in. While we always used to send each other a simple good morning text (usually whoever wakes up first will send the first message), now I wake up to nothing. It wouldn't take long to drop a good morning text before leaving the house/on the way to work, right?

Most of the times, I'm also the one to initiate dates and stuff. On the bright side, he does appear enthusiastic enough when I suggest, but it kinda sucks that he doesn't usually suggest plans because he doesn't have ideas on what to do and where to go. I, too, don't have too many date ideas, but I try to put in some effort to research places or think of things we could do together. After all, we only meet once, at most twice a week.

I don't ask for much, a simple gesture or text that shows he cares for me would make my day. Maybe the above examples seem small to y'all but I can't help but overthink that he's just not that into me.

We once talked about friends where one party appears to slowly put in less effort in the relationship and the other party got upset. He said that it was normal to put in less effort once a couple gets comfortable with each other. And I told him I totally disagree with that.

So boys and girls, please don't take your partner for granted! Make sure they know you still love and care for them. Something that seems trivial to you, could go a long way.

I applied for a USP international programme. Suffice to say, I am a USP student. I was rejected for the programme obviously (else I probably wouldn't be here) but I got over that fairly quickly. What I couldn't get over was how the office dealt with applications and the attitude it was indicative of.

When you apply for, well, anything, you'd expect some kind of resolution, no? You either get what you're applying for or you don't, but you'd at least want some kind of information about the outcome. I didn't even get a rejection email. I had to go into EduRec wondering what happened to my application only to see that it was rejected. They couldn't even be bothered to send me a goddamn email much less come up with some bullshit excuse about the grounds for rejection. 

No interview, no nothing, just ""oh I hope you check a website you wouldn't normally be expected to check some time eventually"". Like, seriously? If that's how you wanted do it, then the least you could do is tell applicants that they have to check EduRec for the outcome after XXX date. You couldn't even do that. It's one line. Oh. My. God.

Students invest so much emotional energy with every application. Even goddamn Google and Facebook sends you a rejection email. It's not even about the content, you know more than half the time it's just the typical mumbo jumbo they send everyone else but AT LEAST THEY CARE ENOUGH.

It's bad enough having to deal with the constant imposter syndrome, on top of that you throw in having to deal with this ridiculous attitude. Amazing. I don't even care what happens now because I'm never applying for another international programme with USP but I hope the office starts learning that students have feelings too and that what is going on SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING.

And he seemed really angry after I asked him the question, and started scolding me in Singlish, and unfortunately (or fortunately maybe) I couldn't understand what he was saying, but I interpreted it as ""what genital are you looking at, if you are not happy let's box it out'. I want to make clear that I asked the question very politely and in a friendly way, and that I didn't intend to hurt him in any way.

I don't understand his reaction, and I wanted to know if from a Singaporean point of view my question is seen as rude. In Sweden, we make small talk everywhere and offering help is not seen as rude at all. Could it be that he thought I was insulting his ability to solve math questions?

Wasted so much of my time and youth just to earn a couple of thousands. With that amount of salary, I'm barely surviving in Singapore. Earning a salary that is above the medium income means nothing. People with financial assets can easily generate more income than you. Even if you are spending time working your ass off. I guess it is just a matter of time, that people in singapore will try to bring down the system. As inequity widen even further and does not work for the majority of the people.

746,"I would like to find some good and genuine relationship advice.

I have been dating this girl through university and after (3 years). We spent a lot of good times together, shared similar life goals and drive, and have so much memories together. We also got to meet and know each others' family - loving and caring for them together. Life is such a bliss and I thought she was the one. 

However, everything fell apart five months ago. She started her work and went into society, and we had different schedules, priorities etc. There were also things she didn't like about me, and that I am partly at fault too. Anyway, Love was not strong enough to hold everything together. When 'reality' kicks in, finances, more and better options out there - she was still young and quite a catch, so things ended with us.

I still have feelings for her, and such memories are difficult to let go. I saw her as part of my family. But at the same time, I cannot control what she does or choosing to 'upgrade' to someone else. The pain is excruciating as I've given my all and she was a close one. 

Could Prof Ben and other commentators shed some light on this/ if I even should/ how I could win her back? 

Much appreciated.

747,"Have been friends with this girl since JC and she is generally a good and true friend, but sometimes her being insecure really irritates me. I know I'm being a hypocrite to rant about this here but I honestly cannnot do this to her or she will get sad and feel that she is a always bothering me (ever since I knew her, I know that she is very senstive). Like for instance, we were in a clique with 2 other girls back in JC but she had a beef with girl A. Although they have been on good terms after that small misunderstanding they had in JC, they weren't texting and meeting up as often as back then. So on Friday, this friend of mine asked if girl A said anything about her. And I was like, ""no, why?"" I mean she have better things to do since she is quite bz with her current life. And today (11/12) she suddenly texted me about that question, which I'd already forgotten about, mentioning that she only asked out of her insecurities, incase I get the wrong idea that both of them are having a conflict again. 

Honestly, I don't get why she have to ask me this question repeatedly. It isn't the first time she's doing this. I mean people aka girl A have better things to do what, it's not like she whole day nothing better to do but bitch about you or what right. And she (girl A) is also not thay kind of person (also anoyher genuine friend of mine). And I find it very tiring to always reassure her that it's fine, and that I understand where she is coming from. Because everytime she clarifies things with me, she will send me a whole paragraph and honestly, I'm a lazy ass so today, I was fking lazy to reply shit, but I had to, so I simply sent an, ""ok,"" and a sticker right after. 

Sorry for the rant, but I really can't do it anywhere else. She is my close friend and one that I treasure alot, but it's just her insecurities really make me pekcek.

I can 100% guarantee you that if I was a female and said guys were staring at me, you guys would not be saying the shit y’all commented. 

My issue is a sense of social etiquette, nothing else, but now I see something else. WOULD YOU like to get stared at ? Probably not. Tell me lah honestly, would you be ok getting stared at ? Especially the girls in the comments trying to poke fun. When, y’all girls get stared at, y’all immediately will say stuff like how the guy staring at you is a creep. So girls cannot be creeps meh ? Same thing like how people say men cannot be victims of sexual assault simply because they’re a man. 

Somebody did say I have anger management issues, yes I do and I’m trying to work on that, but I usually don’t get angry, I just get worked up and agitated easily under stressful conditions (like how I mentioned I had some issues going on, but of course no one noticed) 

As for my last paragraph in my previous post. That post clearly showed how a lot of people put on a mask about our values. If a girl mentioned these same things I said, people would be willing to show support, but if a guy says so, no one gives a damn. Way to go. Same thing like, if a girl is feeling depressed // feeling down, they are more likely to get support but when a guy says the same thing, what do we do ? We tell the guy to man up.

And for the flings...I don't have an issue with that.

While our relationship has been great, I feel that he continues to struggle with his past.

I was once in a situation like yours and I denied to have dinner at Popeyes and we went to a porridge stall opposite ponggol nasi lemak instead. And as absurd as this sounds, my girlfriend literally walked all the way to Kallang Wave to get that stupid fried chicken, leaving me behind at the porridge stall. But lo and behold this bimbo got lost on the way home LOL not sure why she didn’t use grab, I think cos she didn’t link her card, nor did she have enough cash, and she didn’t bring her ez link with her, she had to resort to calling me for help. Ended up after we reached home, she ate a bit then gimme the rest already. Anyways, what I want to bring across is, girls also have pride de, since she is willing to listen to you that night, although she seems like she isn’t, means she has cooled down to a certain extent already, so it’s your turn to apologise (no matter if it’s your fault or not JUST SAY THE WORD SORRY) and give her a hug after that. In chinese is known as 给台阶下 y’know? Also, one thing you should know is that saying sorry doesn’t mean you lost the argument, it simply reflects your maturity. At the end of the day, you still want her right, so this is the only thing you need to do to win her back, which makes you the ultimate winner.
 
Oh yes and as much as I agree that girls should be treated like princesses, don’t ever touch her things when you’re at her house, it goes the same way as how you don’t like you mom or girlfriend or any other human being touching your gaming consoles right??

It may sound unexpected but I have always read how some who are bedridden look at our posts to get connected to the world out there. Especially after I shared my condition, many silent friends got in touch with me to share their own experiences. Some have lost their loved ones. Some are suffering from some physical or mental conditions. 

Everyone has their own stories to live. Every story is unique. Many times, we are given challenges we need to face because those are tests to prepare us for greater things. Again, I am living my life story too. I totally understand how life gets shitty at times, how dark the outlook can be, how we don’t see light at the end of the tunnel at times.

This is written to every single friend who feels life hasn’t been the best to them. Hey, fight on. You are never alone. Someone in Singapore is fighting all his shitty situations too. Life is unfair in the fairest way. Your story will be a good one ultimately.

I think the chicken rice cost 11 euros. I forgot, the price was written, in a font size that is smaller than where the chicken was originated.

777,"I am a final year male NTU undergraduate going on internship in semester 2. Thought I should start my search for my significant other. Never dated or had a relationship before. I feel I am mature enough now after observing my parents and elders.

I met a NUS girl during summer 2019. I was attracted to her outgoing personality, and thought that she was straightforward, down-to-earth and mature. I felt that she appreciated that there is a diversity of people i.e. every individual is made differently, and each of them is perfect and imperfect in many ways. (To some people, this is known as empathy, or putting oneself in other's shoes. But this is just the way I view it.)

I asked her out but she said she didn't have time, but will keep me updated on her availability.

I texted her 3-4 times after that about casual topics, NOT about meeting up, NOT chasing for her availability. However, I did not receive a single comment from her. I gave her the benefit of doubt: busy school schedule and CCAs.

I consider myself to be an exceptionally patient person. This, I learnt from observing my parents. Is there anyone who dislikes a patient (boy/girl)friend?

After pondering one semester, and consulting my friend about the situation, I now know (or believe that it is most probable...like 99.99999%), she is uninterested and thus, ignoring me to reject me.

I am (very) disappointed with her, NOT because she rejected me, but because she chose ignorance. I thought she was more mature than what her inaction suggested.

Yes, I can imagine putting myself in her shoes. How would I feel and react if someone asked me out, but I am not interested? How do I politely reject this person? What if I misunderstood a friendly gesture as a romantic advancement?

Before meeting this ignorant girl, I had a crush on another girl. I was impressed at how she managed to explicitly say she was attached, but in a tactful and polite(?) way. Wow...so that's why she is already attached: her maturity. 

I am not asking to be rejected in a polite way (although I will appreciate it and wish you all the best nonetheless). All I ask is for some respect. I feel disrespected when you ignore me. It is worse than saying ""I am not interested in you."" Just say ""no"" and I won't bother you. I am not some immature pestering bugger who begs for attention. Not all guys are like that. For **** ' * sake.

As 2019 draws to a close, I reflect upon the lessons learnt in my journey to find my significant other.

Life is too short to play stupid games.

I want to be straightforward. I find speaking face-to-face better than texting due to the subtle body languages. After all, you are going to live with your significant other and see each other in person daily. There is no need to hide behind screens. No time for second guessing. However that doesn't mean I rush into things. I will try it out. If it doesn't work out, well so be it, let's wish each other the best. If it works out, well...

I'm just a boy, standing in front of a girl, asking her to love him.

781,"How important is humour in attracting a partner and sustaining a relationship? I saw that many girls ask for a ‘sense of humour’ in guys. But I thought singaporeans are the most serious people in the world? I have tried ways to have more humour like trying to find jokes online. Every time I tried to make people laugh, people either don’t find it funny or the joke was too fake.

782,"For this story,i ll be using the name Jane Doe to conceal the girl identity in the story.

I met jane doe in cs1010s during y1s1 for one of the supplementary classes as we were struggle for one of the assignment and needed help. Jane and i exchange no so that we can discuss on future assignments for this mod as it was hard... we grow close together partly cause we suffered through this mod together.  she was lovable and cute.. kept calling me her senpai and it feels good for someone smart and pretty as her to call me that. and i did help her alot for cs1010s in sem1 and ger in sem2... and gotten quite close to her.  she is also supportive and encouraging of me to keep doing my best in my studies.

Fast forward y2s1 where the problems begin. We had our fair share of bad group mates in the mods we took. So i decided to group with jane doe and 2 of my good friends for this mod called ges1021. The first few weeks. She seemed like a nice and sweet girl.. and she and my friends got along fine. BUT she began showing signs that she might like me. Like playfully poking me and leaning on my shoulder from time to time and i was atttacted to her because she a pretty girl with a  sweet and kind deposition. Since we were expected to make our own notes for ges1021, she started to rely on my notes and that where things went sour.

Six strikes too many.  Firstly, Jane Doe began acting strangely during SEP application week. Jane Doe disappeared on our group when we need to decide places to go . But you re werent there and ignored me texting you 5-6 times whether she like to go a place near her house for convenience. But Jane Doe told us that she were busy with cca and sep and couldnt even bother to come to a non webcast lecture. Secondly, Jane Doe didnt bother to study for the mod you choose and complain how my notes are unclear for you to understand and decide to text me 100 qn to prepare for your midterms. I helped cause im afraid you were lagging too behind. Thirdly, you demanded me to restructure the notes i send her and even ask me to highlight in red the comments the prof stress on... but i was too blind to see and i thought is normal to help a girl you adore so much.

Fourthly, when the ges1021 prof said we had to change the location used for our project Jane Doe was furious. I get that. But the moment Jane Doe acted like she knew better than the prof  that where i draw the line. Cause no matter how smart you are is pretty arrogant thinking you re better than her right? Fifthly, closer to the deadline i get that you re stress with your competition coming and your geh midterms incoming. But you didnt have to show poor attitude by being all sarcastic about losing a few marks for not using apa format when you just want me to do the work or how you used me to do the work needed to be done when you could have asked the group. We re in this together but Jane Doe seemed to look out for herself and pretend to contribute significantly. when the rest of the group done significantly more work than whay you did. And lastly, you told me to make use of my ue as mod that can help me in the future. When i planed my sep outline with her advice in mind hoping Jane Doe would be happy for me. But she just ignored me.. like im only worth a damn when you needed my notes which you are expected to craft yourself and that the final straw cause at that point im just exhausted and just gave up on her. 

Am i crazy?
The whole sem i try and try to chase her and extend my hand to jane doe. But it seem she only interested and exploting me cause im just too gullible. I thought is normal for a guy to chase after a girl. And i must be crazy for not thinking she cant be in the wrong and that she still a good person. But she had me wrapped round her finger for her use. But thanks to my friends who at least let me see reason i decided to block her on whatsapp cause the girl i know no longer there and there no point keeping in contact with somebody who only want my notes..

So to Jane Doe, you really played me like a fiddle. And the kind-hearted girl i know before me is dead in my eyes. You probably wont change.. but at the very least from the experience i learn that you should have the strength and courage to walk out from any toxic relationship with anyone who just out there to exploit.. it is hard but a necessary evil.. that you have to take for your own good.

785,"Feeling kind of sad that at mid 20s that I still do not have a boyfriend. (Female here) Thinking about whether I might actually be single forever. Almost all of my friends are guys and sometimes I wondered is it because of my guy friends that potential suiters backed away. Most of the time its other people (not my friends) who asked if xxx or yyy is my boyfriend, though they are not. It makes me feel like cutting them out of my life.

Nobody have ever confessed to me, and my guy friends either say they never wanted to get married, see me as a bro or that they don't wish to lose our friendship because I'm the nicest female friend they had, plus I always give really good advice.

Sometimes I wish that maybe someone, among my guy friends had actually liked me a bit since they can be really nice to me like (all 1 to 1) volunteer to drive me to and fro from home to a destination because I had too much things to carry, invite me to his house and cooked a really nice dinner, walk me home when it is very late, treat me a small meal here and there.

No skin-ship was involved in any of the activities and they didn't even stand close to me so no flirting was involved also. Without me saying anything they will sometimes reject me directly like calling me bro or reiterate our strong friendship. It makes me feel kind of sad sometimes.

Maybe I'm just chasing something that doesn't exists. And I should appreciate the friendships that I have. Sigh.

787,"Hi all, just need to rant and maybe seek some advice here. I've been in a 3 years relationship with my girlfriend. I'm 22 and she's 21. She is the sweetest, most attractive and most genuine woman I've known, but this statement is only applicable when she is in a good mood. Recently, we've been in a series of arguement and she is currently giving me the cold shoulders, on and off. For instance, last week, she desperately wanted to have her milo dinosaur, but since she was down with the flu, I stopped her and gave her warm water instead. She got pissed and stopped eating and simply watched me eat instead. The next day, she was back to her normal self again.

However, few days later, we argued again about cleaning her room. We have been living together for 2 months, with a maid, in another apartment, owned by her parents. Usually the maid will do the chores but she is on leave for 3 weeks due to some family issues at her hometown, so naturally, we had to do the chores. I started to tidy her room, including the wardrobe, toilet and her makeup table for her as it is in a mess, and vacuum it right after, but she got irritated, and questioned the purpose of arranging stuff when it's gonna be messy later on. Okay, I admit, I'm a clean freak so I cannot stand how messy things are. So, she got angry, and I've got chased out of her room since then. She doesn't even want to talk to me now and have been out with her girlfriends everyday to avoid me.

Yesterday night, after she got back home, I tried talking to her since I feel that things need to be fixed in this relationship. Although she was playing games on her phone and acted like she wasn't listening, I know she was. But she simply didn't want to contribute anything to the 'discussion'. I'm at wits end. I still love her, I'm willing to do the chores for her too but I feel like this relationship is reaching it's end after this fight. Love experts, help me, how can I make her things better. Please don't advice me to break up, because it won't be an option, unless she sincerely wants to.

I am a Chinese, but my boyfriend is a Malay. I want to be with him forever, but i dont want to convert to Muslim. It's not that i dont love him. I do love him, but im not a religious person. I dont think it is right to convert to a religion that i dont believe in.

I always asked him if we can just remain in our current religion when we get married, but he cant give me an answer.

With him, i can eat halal food (though i like non halal food more hahaha) or even accompany him on whatever festive (like Ramadhan). I wish we can reach a compromise. I dont want to lose him just because of religion issue.

I had a very weird dream about this girl from my course. It's at a public place, where we coincidentally walked past and had an eye contact, but and she was with another guy, while I'm alone. I was surprised to see her, and when I turned back to look at her again, I saw that they entered either in a restaurant or cafe (I can't really remember it well, since that's not the important part).

As I kept walking, suddenly I felt someone jumping into my back and holding on to me. I turned my head around and noticed she was the one who jumped onto me. After that she suddenly talked to me and brought me to meet the guy she was with. It felt so surreal that the next thing I knew, I woke up feeling weird.

I know it sounds creepy, but has anyone experienced this before? Or is it just me?

793,"Hi all, thank you for taking your time to read this :)

My work entails of me working in shifts so it's hard to meet up with my partner sometimes. When we are unable to meet, we will call each other to talk about our day. As my partner comes from a bigger family with 4 other siblings, space at home is more scarce and it is hard for him to have privacy. I did mention to him before that I prefer to not have our conversation on loudspeaker and he respects that, therefore he will go into his shared room (his brothers are not around when I call, otherwise he will tell me first) to talk to me. Despite being behind closed doors, the mother will eavesdrop on our conversations and make unnecessary comments to him when we hang up, especially on days when we have arguments. Comments like ""y'all are not ready"" and telling my partner to consider settling down with me. I feel like she disliked me a little, especially after since she *eavesdropped* on my partner talking to my mum about some of his career matters, instead of approaching her first (bear in mind that my partner would definitely talk to his mum, just that circumstances made him to approach my mum first instead). I don't feel that our relationship is unstable other than having arguments once in awhile which we will always try and settle before the day ends. We basically don't allow each other to go to sleep angry, unless it's a very big issue which requires more time to resolve.

Another matter that happened which made me feel annoyed  was when we decided to BTO. My partner wanted to receive the blessings of our parents before proceeding with it and I acknowledged that it was important to have it. My parents were very supportive, along with his dad, but his mum was once again, questioning the stability of our relationship. What I find it hard to accept was the fact that his sisters did not seek the approval of his parents before bto-ing. Yet, he took the effort and time to do so. She did come around to the idea of it after hearing him out. After a few of such ""incidents"", I mentioned to him that I might not be able to get along well with his mother after marriage and he did express that he does not need me to do so (just don't be rude and still show the basic respects to her, which I will definitely will). My partner is very understanding towards this matter but I do not wish to make him feel sandwiched between us. He loves his mother alot, but also acknowledges that his mother can be difficult at times, and bias as well. His mother ""favours"" his other 4 siblings more, despite him being the eldest son. He is a very filial son to his mother and is also very tolerant and patient in our relationship. I understand how in-laws matters can get tricky in future if not handled properly. I try to make things better now sometimes by getting stuff/ souvenirs for his mum and family when it's special occasions or when I travel overseas. 

All in all, I guess I need some advice as to how I should go about handling such issues. I don't want it come to a situation whereby my partner has to choose between his mum and I.

She also said “ I am saying your whole class........ doesn’t likes u ..Except for the Show off but humble girl likes u only”.

797,"Hello everyone,

I am a French girl currently on exchange at NUS, and I would like to share with you a bad experience that I had at one of the hawker centres on campus soon after I arrived, as I would like to know what Singaporeans would think about it. 

I am quite a health conscious girl, and I pay a lot of attention to what I eat, especially regarding the quality and sourcing of the primary ingredients; I want to know where the food comes from and for example for meat, in what conditions the animals were reared, for vegetables and rice if the producer uses organic and environmentally friendly farming methods, for eggs if they are free range, etc... 

So when I ordered some chicken rice at a stall, I asked the lady if she could tell me where the rice and the chicken came from, how they were reared, and if she knew the producer. She seemed really angry after I asked her the question, and started scolding at me in Singlish, and unfortunately (or fortunately maybe) I couldn’t understand what she was saying, but I interpreted it as “you are insulting me and my food, and if you are not happy, you can go find food elsewhere”. I want to make clear that I asked the question very politely and in a friendly way, and that I didn’t intend to hurt that lady in any way. However, don’t you think that it is normal to want to know where the primary ingredients of the food that you are eating are coming from? I mean food is your body’s fuel, and as Hippocrates said, “let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.”

I don’t understand her reaction, and I wanted to know if from a Singaporean point of view, my questions were seen as rude. In France, even in a small and simple family restaurant, asking this kind of question is not seen as rude at all, quite the opposite, as it shows the chef that you are interested in his work and appreciating his food by wanting to know more about it, and he/she will happily tell you about it. It is also quite frequent that restaurant owners, especially in the countryside, directly source their primary ingredients from the producer.

Also, I noticed that food culture in Singapore is very important (which is great, as it is the same in France, and I love that!), however, it seems to me that Singaporeans don’t pay a lot of attention to the origin and quality of the primary ingredients, which is a paradox to me as from good ingredients results tasty and healthy food. So to all Singaporeans, what do you think about this topic? Do you agree or disagree with me? 

Thanks for reading my long post, and don’t hesitate to let me know in the comments what you think about all that, and if you can relate to my experience!

From a French girl who loves Singapore, Singaporean food, and NUS!

801,"If anyone is keen to hear me out and provide me with some advice regarding SEP, I’d be more than grateful! I’m a fass student this year who applied for exchange next year. Though the results are not out yet, I’m wondering if I should actually accept if I do get an offer. My main concern lies with the expenses. My family is not well to do and local U expenses itself is something we can only manage to get by with. I take on part-time jobs though i admit, it’s quite a struggle at times with the heavy workload as a double major. I’ve tried applying for scholarships but never got a reply, not even a chance at an interview. Even though my results were not stellar, neither was I the cream of the crop, they were at the very least above average and I was able to go to “elite” schools and do well there. But not even an interview opportunity? :( 

Personally, I think SEPs are the best opportunities to get exposed to a education elsewhere that is ‘just right’ - not for the whole of undergrad, yet not short enough for the experience to be unrepresentative. And it’s a great way to open one’s eyes to the big big world out there. I think it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity, to study abroad as an undergrad and have sufficient liberty to still enjoy and be exposed to other culture. And I know that there are bursaries or even loans available, but I’m just not sure and I don’t want to add more financial burdens to my family. So to those who have been in similar shoes, may I have a rough gauge for the expenses for exchange to UK and Aus? And do you all think it’s worth it to get a loan just to go on a SEP?

Even my 3year old Nephew can articulate better than him. I’m always invested in the Sg music community, but one reason why so many good musicians in Sg can’t progress is because we give importance to these clowns when there’s actually good singers / rappers / musicians out there. Some might think that they’re not good enough, hence why they don’t receive a huge following, but that isn’t true.

820,"I'm a fairly good looking female and is active in the hostel sports community. I have a boyfriend in the army but as I have a high libido, I have repeatedly fallen to the temptation of sleeping with other guys from school, hostel, as well as tinder ONS. Each time I think its okay so long as my boyfriend doesnt find out. However, as the numbers climb, it is a matter of time before someone leaks it out.  My boyfriend is ording soon and will be enrolling in NUS next year and will likely be staying in hostel too as he is a gifted athlete. I know many will judge and call me a slut but I hope you can put yourself in my shoes. I know I have made mistakes but it is just so difficult for me to avoid the temptations but each time after the deed I just feel like such a user as well as being used. There have even been a few times when guys have simply ejaculated into me and said sorry they couldnt control, leaving me to see a doctor to rush to get the morning after pill before meeting my bf on saturdays. I really dont know how to stop or dig myself out of this hole or how to handle my bf finding out one day and I really do not want to leave him. I cannot confess to him as he would definitely leave me. I hope there can be some kind souls who can put themselves in my shoes and offer me some helpful advice (I know I deserve the scoldings but please I need a workable solution) as you would offer them if I was your best friend.

826,"Dear Prof Ben, 

I'm not joking here. I've secretely started my own company and which is now being acquired. However, I think I'm being seriously low-balled. 

I have no idea how valuations work and all. It started out as a cool side project but then people started taking notice and the project was eventually monetized. Now a big company is considering buying my project for huge (6 fig) sum

Part of me wants to just cashout and reap the rewards but part of me also feels like perhaps there is potential for something more? I am lost. I don't know how to decide. 

Is there anyone I can seek advice from or any resources NUS has to help us navigate this journey? Google doesn't help at this point. 

Also, if I suddenly receive a huge sum of money in my bank account, will I alert the authorities? Like will I be questioned on the origin of the money? 

I haven't told anyone as I don't want my friends to see me differently, I still want a normal uni life. If people were to find out that I own a 6 figure business either they'll most likely want to use me or they'll think i'm just rubbing it in their face. I can't ask anyone in real life as a result. I know this is probably not where I should be seeking advice but I figured someone with the right know-how or the right connections might be reading this. No harm trying i suppose?

831,"If you can only choose between having luck in career and having luck in love, which one would you choose? 

My best friend is going to give birth soon. I am genuinely happy for her but couldn't help but feel a slight tinge of envy and hopelessness.

When will such nice things ever happen to me? I have a great bf and a promising career but I don't feel happy at all. I feel guilty for saying this but I don't see a future with my bf. Just like my best friend, I've always dreamed of settling down early, starting a family and being a stay home mom. But my bf and I have different expectations. 

He expects us to settle down only in our 30s. He expects me to continue working even after having kids. He expects me to pay for half of the household expenses. All these seem very reasonable but I secretly hope that he would change. 

My best friend envies me for having a great career. But little did she know that I envy her more for finding such a great guy who is willing to support her dreams. 

When she decided to take a few months' break from work to take up a few courses, her husband offered to pay for her course fees. Whether she is working or not, he never fails to transfer her a significant amount of his pay whenever he receives his pay. Whenever she falls sick, her husband would always take care of her. He also does household chores and cooks whenever he's free.

The best thing is he's very supportive of her throughout their 8 years together. He doesn't expect her to be a housewife or working mum. And coming from a poor background, he's very hardworking, humble and down to earth although he works at a prestigious firm with a crazy huge paycheck.

Am I wrong to want to have a life like my best friend's? She seems to have all the luck in love. Meeting the love of her life at a young age, getting married and having kids, all of which are what she always wanted. 

My parents have always encouraged me to have a career and depend on myself. I don't even dare to tell them that I just want to be a housewife. I also feel ashamed to tell my friends or anyone else about this. Afterall we are living in a modern society where women are expected to be strong and independent. 

If I can only choose between having luck in career and having luck in love, I would certainly choose the latter. But I am sure many of you would choose the former. Because it just seems wiser?

I have noticed that this situation has become especially pronounced when I have insufficient rest / sleep, which, unfortunately, is quite often, given the stress, pressure, intensity of work etc over the past few months leading to the exams. it became so bad that during one of my exams recently, I simply could not read the exam paper properly: I had to squint to read it.

847,"Seeking for honest opinions. Sorry, it will be a very long story. No trolls please.
I'm average-looking and I’m currently going out with a guy that’s 7 years older than me and is a working adult. He is attractive, smart, modest, humorous, has a well-paying job, very popular and most important of all, he has a good personality. I have some mutual friends that that has told me that he always tries his best to keep a distance from girls that approaches him as well.

We really love each other and always make consistent effort to try our best to spend time with each other, with him working around with his hectic working life and with me managing my examinations, projects, etc. He treats me very well, understands me, and is always the first to notice if I’m in a sour mood after going through a bad day. Occasionally we do have our quarrels and fights due to our differences, but we managed to resolve it and stick together despite it all, accepting the other for who we are. In overall, we are together with each other for a good 1.5 years.

I know all of this sounds too good to be true, and all this while I'm trying my best to improve myself to be better - be it in terms of working on my appearance, personality, learning new skills, etc. so that I would be able to better match up with him.

But here's the catch – at the beginning of the relationship, my family knows about it and objects to him, saying that he's too good for me and that he's not taking me seriously, as well as saying about some other really nasty stuff about him without knowing him all that well, which was not really fair to him. Of course, knowing that it definitely wasn't true, I tried to speak up for him, but they said that I was very blinded by him and that I should really face reality and wake up, why would someone of such a good calibre want me. 

I discussed about this with him and it landed a really huge blow to him, as he's really very concerned about the opinions of the people around me and he was depressed for quite a long period of time. He was really understanding and understands that my family just wanted the best for me and that it was normal for parents to be protective of their child, but was still very hurt from their comments nonetheless. He told me that it’s okay and I should not worry my family, let them think that we have broken off, and keep our relationship from my family for the time being and we will figure out a way to solve this somehow eventually. I tried to talk to him, cheer him up, but to no avail. We continued sticking together and after a few months, he went back to his normal cheerful self. My family still suspects me going out with him from time to time and was quite unhappy, but kept silent about it, only occasionally dropping hints here and there and prompted me about it.

He was very depressed to the point where his family noticed the changes in him, and was really concerned about him. After asking him about it and knowing about my family’s objections and hurtful remarks, his family, who had really liked me at the start, started hating on me with the same intensity of how much they had liked me previously. They were really angered by my family’s unjustified comments about their son. I only knew about later on where he kept me knowing about this all this while and only briefly told me that his family knows about this matter a year later. However, he did not tell me that his family hated me because he was afraid that I would be hurt. It was only then afterwards where I found out from my mutual friends about they hated me.

His family knows that we are still together and although they disagree to it, they still respected my S/O’s opinion and did not say anything much about us. However, recently, his family has started rushing him for marriage and asked when would he be able to bring a good partner home, to which, he replied to them jokingly to give him a year and he would find one girl to bring home (cause he’s in his late 20s, they are worried, and I think, they really object to us being together, hence asking those). He did not tell me about this because he was scared that I would overthink, it was from the mutual friend where I found out about this.  

Honestly, I don't know what to do anymore. I’m having thoughts where I think I’m keeping him from finding his right one, but still, I really don’t want to leave him. I’m not telling him about this because I do not want him to worry about me. I’m very confused. What are your opinions on this?

I feel like i have to get this off my chest because the guilt has been killing me every day that i avoid it. It's not that i forgot to contact you, but i dont think i have the face to do so, even more, after finding out that you're in the same course.

I would like to apologize for the misdirection given to you years ago because back then, i was in uni and i really had rose-tainted glasses on, sharing with you how great being a pharmacist was without knowing fully. One could say i was optimistic, i wanted to be at the front line, studying hard so that i could be the best pharmacist for my patients. But I too was not fully aware of whats to come back then.  

Fast forward to now when me and my peers' bonds are ending... i really cant say the same. Day-2-day, yes i do counsel patients, do medication reconciliation, even run some clinics and help patients with their medications and pre-meds. There are good days, then for the a majority 90%... not so. it all feels empty, it feels like routine with no growth. It feels like what i do is not valued, not respected. With my peers, I feel happy but in the wards, it's like I am transparent to all. What I hoped to bring about for my patients, was slowly never to become a possibility. What i learnt and studied was rarely utilized, and sometimes sadly forgotten, and I have recognized this as early as my pre-registration days. With others leaving in high numbers over the past years, leaving us few behind to continue their workload is also tiring. Now it is my turn too, but i also cant see how my skills here can be useful outside and wonder if it is too late to start anew as well. I am afraid but I myself also want to find joy again.

I really wish i shut my mouth back then, or knew more to provide you with a more balanced view. I really hope it isnt too late for you like what has been for me. 

I have so much more to say, but

I’m an only child too. Worse still, my dad stayed with his parents and unmarried sibling, and they expect me to be a surrogate child and provide for them.

My grandma has 6 kids and 10 grandchildren, but I’m the only one to bring her for medical appointments. My uncle used to take care of her needs until he fell ill himself. They now expect me to move back to take care of the 5 old folks at home, and bring them to the doctor. 

I had to draw my boundaries clearly and refuse, knowing that all the financial burden and time spent on medical appts (we’re talking about 1-2 appts weekly) would be foisted to me by all the cousins. I don’t understand why dad’s unmarried siblings would expect me to pay and spend most of my annual leave ferrying then to the drs when my cousins drive and are earning so much more(close to or over 5 digits for half the cousins), and they knew I used up all my leave on part time studies. 

Some welfare group has been by and offered them aid too. They rejected and said relatives would help, then promptly called me and demanded that I buy or rent the required items for them. Not sure if its their pride, but I sure wish they would distribute the burden out more evenly. They would tell me there is nobody else, but when I insisted on not having any leave, they managed to find another cousin who brought him to the doctor.

866,"There are many people talking about how they don't have close friends in life, about how hard it is to make friends in uni. Many people have said that it is part of adult life that friends come and go and they just have to get used to it. I disagree. 

My grandmother passed away recently, and at her wake many of her friends whom she knew for decades came forward and shared how they were thankful for all that my grandmother did for them. They recounted how she went to care for them after they had surgery, how she said encouraging words to them at their lowest point when people were criticising them, and how much they would miss the joy she brought to others. My grandmother is my role model in what it means to love my friends. 

So when a friend in school told me she changed friends whenever she entered a new phase of life because it's part of ""adulting"", I was alarmed, because I feel that is degrading the precious value of friendship. Nowadays a girl and a guy can meet in uni and then when one of them confesses after less than a month the other says, ""Sigh, you mean alot to me, and I really wanted to keep this friendship."" In my mind I'm thinking, what friendship? They barely know each other...? 

Friendship goes beyond companionship, it is a tried and tested bond that stands the tests of time and circumstance. I myself am lucky to have close friends that I have known for over 10 years. I know they will be in my life for a long time because my friendship with them is not seasonal. Sometimes I really hate my friends for the things they do or the hurt they cause me. But I realised that friendship works like this: I like my friends for some of their characteristics, but I love them despite some of their characteristics. They are in my life because both sides invest in the friendship, and continuously care, love and forgive. 

So to all those out there who feel empty because they don't have a friend that stays, don't let others tell you that it's reality. To experience friendship that lasts a lifetime is possible and beautiful. Keep trying because from my grandmother's life I know it is possible :)

870,"This story happened quite a while ago, but I didn't think about it until today. It came back to me because I just caught up with one of the people who was directly involved earlier. Since then, I couldn't help thinking about the way people act post-relationships. Is it insensitivity or cruelty?
Long story short, my girl friend was seeing this guy over a year ago. They dated for almost half a year (at least as far as I remember), every one knows about it. Less than a week after the break up guy started dating another girl, posted about it all over instagram. Mutual friends' instastories feed were buzzing with his updates, about how they dined together, studied together, hang out in his dorm room where him and his ex just spent a series of nights together just a few weeks ago, yeah you get the picture.
And eventually in his 6-month anniversary with his new love he posted a super cheesy post with all the sappy cringy phrases, and a special reference to his ex as ""past mistake"".
I know, that what I think about his action, has no impact on his life at all. And that, being utterly callous after falling out of love is far too common. Girls also burn and trash their exes' stuff, rubbing their rebounds into exes' faces. And there are other things, that happened between the abovementioned ex-lovers, which for the sake of my friend's well-being, I'd rather not say.
But what is all of these for?
To prove your attractiveness? That you deserve to be loved? That your life is better without your ex?
I can understand that if you have been cheated, or abused mentally and physically, and you want to show the world that, leaving the person who hurt you, you still can be happy. Ok, fine!
But what about those lovers that are gentler, kinder, more harmless? For whichever reasons, you still chose to leave them - he doesn't make enough money, she isn't exactly girlfriend material, not submissive enough, not romantic enough, the sparks are gone... But is it necessary to cast aside all the bonds created be it long or short term but still exist, to belittle people with your new love which no one knows how long it may last (hours or days)?
What did you prove? You're strong, lovable, cute?
Or your shamelessness and insensitivity to the point of callousness, towards someone who used to be """"before anything else"" to you?
Please do not use ""everyone has the rights to be happy"" to justify your action.
Yes, everyone deserves happiness.
Nobody forbids you to love again, even love more than before, giving your all. It is your heart and your life, so it's your rights.
Back to the above story, yup it's fine. Maybe only then did that guy find his true love. And of course, he has the rights to love anyone he wants to.
But is it necessary to parade that change of heart to everyone, in front of the embarrassment of the person who used to be yours? Especially when we just learnt about your separation a few days before?
And that the time you spent together, moments shared, promises made have no meaning whatsoever?
Does this mean that the rights to love and freedom of expression give you the rights to trample on the dignity of a person you used to be with, as well as your own self-respect?
I don't know if someone find that admirable, or touching or whatever, I don't care. All I find is contempt.
Only know to love yourself, take care of your own pride, willing to disrespect the feelings of someone who used to love you, give you things that are precious to them. What a cold hard slap in the face.
Then what's the point of love, if what you get back is callousness?

We constantly compare ourselves to others-- we have to copy what other people are doing so that we don't lag behind, without thinking if what others are doing is actually meaningful. We work our entire lives to attain superficial status symbols -- money, cars, branded goods, etc. without asking ourselves if those material objects actually make us happy. We never give thanks when things go well but when other people don't live up to our expectations we never hesitate to make our voices heard. People complain 24/7. Ironically, our egos are so fragile even the most constructive criticism is seen as an affront to our dignity. Honestly, coming back to sg and being surrounded by negativity makes me feel so suffocated every day. Going overseas has also made me realise that Singapore is a really nice country -- safe streets, good food, great infrastructure etc.  I just wish people would learn to be happy.

Then at the bench rack I saw this average looking guy with weightlifting shoes, and I was amazed by the amount of weight on the bar given his physique and size. I asked if we could share and he looked at me for awhile before grunting and nodding impatiently. As I was removing the plates I felt a bit embarrassed but it was my usual routine so I didn’t want to start my workout with other exercises. When it was his turn I helped him to put all the plates back in, which was super heavy for me, as he was putting the plates he was quite disgruntled and kept mumbling impatiently. I felt paiseh at that moment. 

And then, He. Started. Quarter. Repping. Moving like less than an inch. Afterwards slamming the bar back onto the rack. 

On one hand, I was relieved that I wasn’t hindering a serious lifter’s progress. On the other hand, why did he behave in such a rude manner when he was not a pro from the start? Most people at the school gym that I’ve seen are rather humble.

Slowly and steadily, people starts to move on, and gradually stops talking to you. When you are still friends with the clique, you are always the only one asking them out, or they would just casually say we should have an outing, but it always didn't happen. 

You didn't know what happened, and after 1 year, seeing everyone else having fun with their friends, you find yourself having no friends at all, and being all alone. From what used to be people celebrating your birthday, to a point in time where no one wishes you anymore. 

From being with a group of friends with joy, to seeing them enjoying themselves without you. You realised you are a toxic friend, and slowly things have turned out this way, yet you are unsure of what to do. You search online, only to see pages of information, saying to avoid toxic people, but no information of helping a toxic person to change themselves for the better.

916,"Interracial couple here grappling with the issue of allowance for parents.

To give some background, my parents earned $3k plus combined when I was growing up. They were great at saving up and investing which meant that they were able to retire without expecting anything from me. My family has led a very simple life up to this point (few overseas holidays over many years, home cooked meals most of the time and I gave my parents everything I earned from army and from the part-time jobs I did while schooling) which is the reason for this situation. My girlfriend's parents earned $7k plus combined but have very little savings due to their lavish lifestyle (yearly travels which costs on avg thousands per trip). If it wasn't for CPF, we would probably be stuck financing their golden years (thank you CPF!).

These days, my gf's mum constantly reminds her that her allowance is due. My gf and I scrimp and save for our wedding, housing and renovation so it pains us to see her mum spend money like water. 

The sharp contrast between my parents and her's has made it such that we will end up giving the allowance to her parents begrudgingly. I really dislike this treatment of my girlfriend as an investment.

My idea of filial piety is spending time with my parents, buying things which I know they have a fondness for and also making sure they're healthy and that their needs are met. 

I wish more families had the mindset of paying it forward. I will support my kids, the same way my parents had, and expect nothing in return other than love and affection. This current situation of ""I raised you so you owe me"" has made it unpleasant for alot of young folks. As one of insurance ads said, we will be the last sandwiched generation. Haha

Whenever we see a good-looking person on the street, we will nudge and signal each other to admire at the target. Be it a girl with pretty face/good figure with nice racks, or a guy that is handsome looking/tall and muscular. I love the fact that we share our look-outs because human tend to look at things that are pleasant to the eyes, while we can share this with our partner. Since we are so open, we fully trust one another and stress that its ok to look at good looking people since we are not. 
So recently, I came across something regarding matchy couples you see on the street:

Pretty girl + Ugly guy = Guy is rich
Ugly girl + Handsome guy = True love
Pretty girl + Handsome guy = Perfect match
Ugly girl + Ugly guy = Bobian 

Now come to think of it, I feel like we belong to the 4th equation as how we are conditioned to behave….. oh well.. at least we are happy.

Local born Singaporean here. Just wanted to provide you with some local context. In the previous generation and the generations before that children were seen as assets that made money for the family. So poor families would have many children, some more than 10 kids, so that these kids would faster work and make money for the family.

So let's not sugar coat here. To the older generation kids are assets and money-making tools. Modern day slaves. You can say how there is ""filial piety"", or how we should be grateful for our parents.

I call bullsh!t. This is simple Confucian brainwashing about how the young must bow down and be subservient to the old. This is why you see so many older aunties cutting queue to the bus or food stall. They think they can do whatever they want and its indoctrinated.

To those that say the parents spent all their money on you and you should be grateful - I never asked to be born, and if my life is miserable are my parents going to pay me compensation?

Parents have kids for purely selfish reasons. How your life turns out is the roll of the dice.

If your parents are poor and asking for allowance - adults have the responsibility to ensure that they are able to have enough money for retirement if they are going to have kids. Kids are not cash cows. No money don't have kids.

If your parents are rich and asking for allowance - you are just another regular money bearing asset for them to pad their income. Parents who are rich and don't need any allowance but still insist purely because of the aforesaid Confucian brainwashing.

Children happily do so out of stupidity. Want to be grateful to your parents? There are a million things you can do for them. But giving money to rich retirees is the stupidest thing ever. 

I even read someone saying they ""agreed"" with their parents to give 25% of their income. I congratulate the parents for one of their best investments ever with the highest ROI. Just need 10 kids and their income would be in the top 1%.

My parents aren’t singaporean but I’ve been a singaporean PR since the I was born. My parents have been in Singapore since primary school too. I would say that I’m pretty singaporeanized while my parents still identify more with their home country. They told me that I would not need to give them any part of their salary because they don’t need it. They’re pretty financially stable as well. 

Just want to point out to the harsh commenters that there are cultural differences in the idea of gratitude. In my home country, the norm is not to give money to their parents. If parents have the financial stability, they would rather want their kids to keep the money as it is more practical. I mean it is also dependent on the financial stability of the parents as every family is different. 

Just want to make it a point that everyone’s idea of gratitude is different. My parents did not give money to my grandparents too. We mostly show gratitude and filial piety through non-monetary means, like going on holiday together, spending time together, go out for meals. I was new to the fact that my singaporean friends were giving money to their parents as well. It is all dependent on culture, financial stability and really, what your parents want. I also understand that I am privileged and grateful that my parents are pretty well off, hence they don’t need my money.

936,"Have you ever felt that life is one big prisoners' dilemma?

If you think about it, the rat race in school, and later on in life, is driven by the prisoners' dilemma. We assume that everyone works hard, so we have to work hard too. But if talent or intelligence is normally distributed, then whether or not everyone studies 10 hours a day, or not study at all, one should expect that the relative standing of the outcome to be the same. This simply means that we are always choosing the less optimal outcome as a society - driven by the fear that someone out there is working harder than us - thus we have to work hard too. The consequence is that while acting in our self-interest, we all end up a lot more miserable.

Perhaps some may argue that the above situation reflect the much proclaimed 'meritocracy' that we have. But let me give you a more concrete example.

Recently, I was offered a highly coveted internship, but it involves crazy long hours. For ease of calculations, let's say the monthly remuneration is $10,000, but it requires working 90 hours a week. Logically, all the company has to do is to hire one additional person to split the work. Two people would end up working a very reasonable 45 hours a week, while receiving $5,000 each. Still great. And on a per hour basis, it's still the same rate. 

But then again, this is a classic prisoners' dilemma problem. From the company's perspective, lowering the salary may deter the 'talented' (debatable) candidates form applying. Additionally, there is always someone willing to work longer hours. Therefore, in pursuit of an ever higher paying job, we are choosing the less optimal outcome, by giving companies the leverage to implicitly demand that we work longer hours. The outcome is that collectively as a society, we lose out by sacrificing our quality of life, even though we may be better off financially.

P.S. I didn't take the job.

Also hope that all the people reacting with incredulity realise that this is actually not the norm in plenty of other cultures, so it's not me being unfilial, my parents don't financially support my grandparents, and nor do they expect me to support them. It's quite upsetting to see people with a different cultural context and simply respond with ""oh that must mean they are ungrateful"". In my country, staying with your parents after you have started work is quite frowned upon and people perceive you to be leeching off them despite having your own money, but in Singapore it seems like that is quite common too, so it's just different lah.

961,"#73318 I don't understand, let's try to break it down. 
$500k for a 4-5room HDB is on the high side, but lets just assume its 500k. 

To have 500k in cash when you've just graduated is crazy, but the downpayment required if you're taking a bank loan is 25%, of which 20% can be paid using CPF. Let's assume you and your spouse's CPF combined can only cover 10%, which leaves 75k in cash. Assuming you're not eligible for any grants at all (which is highly unlikely), Working about 3 years after graduation should comfortable net you this amount (both the 50k in CPF and 75k cash on hand) and this is assuming both you and your spouse have $0 upon graduation, which again is very unlikely.

So the remaining $375k on loan, if it is over 30 years it works out to a monthly repayment of $1042, let's just say $1100 after accounting for interest (but after 2 years you can do repricing, so the actual will be less than the 5.5% interest I'm implying).

Assuming your $400 to parents is actually $800 because both sides' parents, that works out to about $3000 in expenditure (of which $200 is in investments which should grow over time, but  lets just treat it as gone). This leaves you with a disposible income of $3300 (I'm also assuming your $7k income is before CPF deduction). Upon paying loan of $1100 you have $2200 left. Spend $500 on your weekends dates you have an extra 1700 to put into savings/investments. Deduct a further $200 for impulse buys and assuming you put all of tis $1500 into investments (4.4% p.a. is the minimum you should be getting or youre doing it wrong)in 30 years it'll be in excess of $1m. A second property to rent is also well within reach.

Also, like what someone has mentioned in the comments, if youre not plannng to have kids a 3-room HDB is enough.

Just someone genuinely confused about how a combined income of $7k with no heavy medical bills cannot afford a HDB. The only reason I can see why is if you're renting your current home, which if you're a Singaporean, is frankly not a very wise thing to do unless you have reasons that most people do not have.

I got to know my current boyfriend on Tinder and he's only slightly taller than me, but that has never been an issue. He never put his height on his profile, neither did that matter when we met. I'm quite short for a girl, by the way! And my exes were pretty tall yet I never felt the same level of attraction for them.

We also feel slightly inferior as most of my classmates are making easily 4-5k one year adjusted. How to survive in Singapore??

And no, we are not spent thrifts, we give our parents 400 a month, utilities 100 , food 1000 (approx 30 dollars a day), transport 150, passive investments 200, uni loans 500 (35k). Checking accounts leave with about 500-700 dollars each month. Anyth leftover from overbudgeted food goes to savings account too.

We eat out only on the weekends and minimal entertainment or drinking. Weekend travels even to neighbouring countries are out of the question at the moment.

The only saving grace is that we have no plans for kids. This is the reality of Singaporean uni grads. Sometimes I envy my classmates in the banking/cs/consulting sector making 5k easily.

971,"Hi, I just needed a platform to rant about this supposedly fine day. My boyfriend just got back from a 3D2N Bangkok trip with his friends today afternoon. Coincidentally, it's my 21st birthday today and we were supposed to spend the evening together. He even booked the restaurant 2 weeks in advance and I've rearranged the celebration with my girlfriends because of the dinner date. However, during my afternoon lecture, I received a message from him stating that he will be sleeping in and the date will be cancelled as he is quite tired. After reading the message, I simply blueticked him as I was rather disappointed and upset, but also hoped that it was part of a surprise he planned so I couldn't even concentrate during my lecture. However, as time passed, I began to believe that he really stood me up. I understand that he is exhausted from the trip, but who doesn't want to feel special on your birthday, especially on your 21st? Furthermore, I haven't even seen him for the whole day. Or am I just being too princessy like how guys always categorise SG girls?

I'm trying to convince myself that a birthday celebration wouldn't be as important as long as he loves me and treats me like a special someone every other day but I just can't seem to be happy, or maybe at least not upset. Hais seems like everyone's 21st is so fun and they get to spend time with their special one, but I just can't help but feel so empty tonight. 

Ok. End of rant. Good night guys.

I never stopped loving her after she left and the breakup was too hard on me. I spent endless nights drowning my sorrows in whiskey hoping to get her out of my head but couldn't. The more I tried, the more I missed her. I even involved myself in a meaningless relationship with another girl ( Girl B ) because my friends suggested this would help me move on. That didn't turn out well because I was always bringing Girl A into our conversations and Girl B felt intimidated at times. Infact, even sleeping with Girl B didn't help because I woke up the next morning every single time and missed Girl A even more. It got to the point where I realized that this was no crazy infatuation that would die out in a couple of months as I expected. So I decided to end it with Girl B for good. I continued with my earlier lifestyle of drinking liquor with and drunk dialing her sometimes so that I could just hear her voice. Little by little, I tried surpressing my feelings for her and I was partly successful because I had cut down on my drinking even though I still missed her a lot. A few months later, she called me up out of the blue and we started catching up on lost time and decided to be friends again. We would call each other all the time and share every little detail about our day and it reminded of the time we were dating and just brought all those feelings back except this time I could see meet her often and listen to her soothing voice everyday. Until recently, when we had a fight over something stupid and I overreacted and since then, we haven't said a word to each other ever since. I want to apologise except I don't think she will forgive me because I was too harsh on her during my outburst which she didn't deserve. I still love her though and miss her dearly

My boyfriend and I will be going on exchange and while we'll be in the same country, we'll still be around 5 hours away from each other. We're considering embarking on an Open Relationship and allowing each other to explore and experiment with other people while overseas and I'm wondering if there's anything I should look out for that could potentially ruin our relationship. 

For more context, we're already in an Open Relationship here (we attend different unis). We actually do spend a lot of time together and like each other very much. We've got a strong relationship and vibe very well together, we just both like the idea of casual hook-ups a lot and didn't see why we needed to give it up just because we're officially attached (although we do intend to be exclusive at some point and have already begun to taper off the casual sex rather than just cutting it off completely so it becomes less sudden...) We don't have any problems with jealousy and are open with each other when it comes to discussing who we sleep with and how we feel.   

However, I'm also aware that having a long-distance open relationship has a vastly different dynamic from one where we see each other three times a week. And things could be potentially more dangerous overseas   (sorry if I'm being paranoid but sexual assault? college drinking gone wrong?? more STDs to pick up??). Have any other couples done this before? What happened in the end? Any problems to look out for? Any important questions to ask before we start on this?

Don’t know any other platform to put my thoughts into words, so here I am. Sorry!
 
I personally don’t understand why ending of relationships must be so painful to either individuals. Painful in terms of the hurt, sadness, anger etc.

I honestly thought, loving someone is hoping for the best for the other person. Which also means respecting whatever decisions the other party make, because they definitely made the decision with the belief that it would make themselves happy. 

If he/she decides to break-up, then it’s a decision they believe will make themselves happy. Shouldn’t we (the other half of that relationship) respect their decision if you truly do love them?  

If one cannot come to terms with it, I Guess it’s more of “wanting the person to by their side”, which seems to be fulfilling your own personal need/want (depends). For this group of people, I truly belief they have no idea what. “Love” is. 

But conversely, from the perspective on the other side, why would you want to break up if you believe the other party won’t be happy? It sure is complicated. 

Just my thoughts because i think many people have lost the meaning of love. But what do I know, I’ve always been a single guy my whole life. Hahaha.

1020,"Could someone share why some lectures, which are held in LT with webcasting equipment, are not webcasted? Firstly, this is underutilising equipment which the school has bought. Secondly, if the lecturer speaks too quickly or the content is too complicated, watching webcast helps students who are slower in absorbing information. Thirdly, should students have any doubt, they could check the webcast before asking the lecturers, thus saving time on both side (the student does not need to wait for the lecture’s reply). 
If the lecturers feel that students would not be consistent if there are webcast, there are work around such as releasing webcast for 1 week only. However, as students are mostly above 18, they should be sensible enough to not need someone to check up on them if they are consistent or not. The stupidest reason I have heard so far is that he (the lecturer) will be talking to an empty LT. The question I would than have is what difference would that make to him? He still gets paid the same amount and students still can learn from him through the webcast. Or is the reason because the lecturer teaches very poorly and doesn’t want concrete evidence on this?
Could NUS do something about this if there is no legitimate reason for not webcasting?

1. Just collected my degree scroll from the University Hall. I really really enjoy studying, but the pain of seeing ""IC"" grades reflected on the scroll made me feel really demoralized and question myself whether I should still pursue my dream of doing postgraduate medicine (My final grade is still within second class, 3.7x). I had to take LOA for two semesters due to anxiety, academic stress and burnout. But my interest still lies in biomedical sciences research and I really hope that one day I could change the way how diseases are being treated through research and make a difference in patients' lives. But right now I severely self-doubt in my own capabilities...

2. After my finals ended in May this year, I went ahead to do a short internship to gain some working experience and also to get used to working life so as to make the transition from a student to a working adult a little smoother. However due to my social anxiety, I did not mingle with my fellow colleagues much during my time there. The thing is - my colleagues are always mingling with each other since they are already close with each other. I've tried my best to fit in by joining into their conversation, but the end result always ended with them minding among themselves..  What's more is that I missed out on my post-internship presentation because of my fear in presenting in front of authorities. During my evaluation session, I was given a leash by mouth by the department head for missing the presentation and criticized for not being collaborative person/team player. I even developed a fear of social interaction. 

It seems like my future is a bleak and I am very unmotivated right now. Hope to hear out some genuine advice out there...

1033,"CS1010s is a module that no matter how hard you work for it; no matter how much amount of time you have spent to work on it.. well... you can still end up unable to score in exam. 

The thing about this module is that, honestly, you can understand what's happening in lectures, you can struggle a lot for whatever missions and tasks but ultimately you can still know how to solve those codes and tasks if you manage to take days to look at those questions and understand the tasks and ultimately know how to solve it after day in and day out. But, you just cannot score in exam... 
Well.. the entire thing I feel towards this module is that for exams, it's not about whether you have understood the things taught in lectures or not, sometimes it's more about the IQ and your brain's speed behind the thinking process when it comes to exams....

My immediate circle of friends and the general consensus of my classmates is.
Starting pay below 4k can survive meh? If you're from a local u and not drawing at least 3.5, sorry you're better off heading to poly/ite and learning more applicable skillsets to reap the long term value.

These are average sentiments from hearsays/rumours/conversations
CS majors start on average 4.5-5k
Biz students 3.5-5k
Engine 3.5-5k
Civil servants start at 3.5 to 5k

Of course there exists the lower or upper bound. But thats not 'average'.

The next more important question is - no combine income of 7k you dare bto or start family? 

2 cents. 

PS NUS/NTU/SMU grads do command higher salary on average. Dont ask me why, its industry standards/impression. There are many private u guys who have great well-deserving high paying careers as well. Lets keep to the aggregated numbers for the sake of the conversation.

1046,"I really envy other girls who receive flowers. I am average looking with some bitch resting face, and have dated before. I already in my late twenties but the only times I receive flowers was when my boss asked the admin to send me a large set of flowers to my grandpa’s funeral and when I performed on stage in secondary school. In my last serious relationship, I hinted to my bf that I wanted flowers but during one karaoke session a few weeks before we broke up, he even had the cheek to sing “When I was your man” into my face. (Think the first line of the chorus). 

I wanted flowers so much that sometimes I think, whoever is the first guy who gives me even one stalk of flower for romantic reasons, I will secretly decide to marry him if he wants to marry me in the future and if he’s not a jerk. I know it’s silly, but that’s how much it somehow irrationally meant to me. I confided about this to a friend and she asked why flowers, why not chocolate why not anything else. I think, it’s probably the meaning of the validation that comes with it - that flowers are pretty, that if someone is willing to spend the money to buy something expensive that last only a few days, you must be worth it in his eyes. I mean, after working, I have the financial ability to buy myself a whole room of flowers if that’s all I want. I also can ask directly for flowers in my next relationship, but it’s just not the same. 

Well, I guess I am really literally 花痴, haha.

And the most embarrassing thing was I got to hear of this news from your new girl, what on earth lmao. Why can't you just keep her mouth shut, so I would still be blinded and not be in this pathetic current state.

1061,"OP of #72816

A big thanks to most of the people with genuine comments. Will probably decide whether I’m going to send her a text after exam week. 

The TL;DR version for the peeps that requested it:

A - childhood best friend 
B - girl of my dreams

A basically was the guy I would grow up with, staying in the same neighbourhood and going to same schools. He was a friend who you could have a good time with but he also had a bad side. I knew all his traits due to that, he was a jerk most of the time and would flirt with many girls due to him being blessed with good looks and confidence. Flirting was just a game to him and he would “do it for fun”. But he did the unthinkable by breaking the “bro code”. 

B was the first girl I ever talked to and would go on to build a very strong friendship, one which would eventually get me to catch feelings for her. However, I could never express it to her but I was content of having her as my “girl best friend”. A was very aware of my feelings for B as I would often share my thoughts about her to him. But instead, he would go on to hit her up on social media and flirt with her. I am not sure why he did that, perhaps it was another challenge for him to achieve or I don’t know what he was thinking. I asked him about it and he bluntly told me “he just needed her help on something”. 

Couple of weeks later A called me to ask if I would get angry if he somehow caught feelings for B, to which I replied that I definitely would. I was already suspicious of something happening between them at that point. Interesting enough, B suddenly asked for a quick meetup dinner the following week possibly to break the news to me. I met her and towards the end of the meal she asked if I was okay with them being together. Knowing A was a jerk and would be only hurting her along the way, I strongly disapproved but to no avail. Heartbroken, I said some hurtful words directed towards A and left. Since then I blocked them know since I didn’t want anything to do with A. 

It was been 5 years since that incident. It has broken me down completed to the point I started cutting out many other friends, as I just wanted to be isolated and not converse with other beings. I preoccupied myself with unhealthy ways to stop overthinking. I would still think about B from time to time as it was really hard to me to forget her. Recently started having dreams about B and I couldn’t help myself but to find a way to talk to B again. I can’t accept losing B in my life cause of actions caused by A. Till this day, I regret blocking B and losing her. So please, I need some advice on what I should do: 

1. Let things be as they are now?

2. What approach should I take to get B back in my life?

Thank you once again for taking the time to read!!

But I still love you, and you still love me. It hurts me to see that you've given up when I'm still fighting. But then again, I'm happy when you're happy. And I can understand why it might be easier for you to give up. It pains me to know that i can't be the person to comfort you whenever you feel down. It hurts me to know that we can't ever share the happiest experiences together again.

I cry whenever I see our photos together, when you and me were laughing and smiling. Why does life have to be so hard on interfaith/racial relationships when it comes to family? The depression just stacks on.

I can't find it in myself to give up on you. I don't know how to give up on you. I know you're still undecided on whether or not we could get back together as a couple because we still love each other, but you feel it's easier for you to break it off for now.
You cry whenever you see me cry, so I try to hide the sadness.

Still trying to find a way to get past this pain

1082,"Hi guys, really need your help here. I've been looking up integrated shield plans (health insurance) as I would like to insure myself against future hospitalisation bills. However, I've been diagnosed with Depression and many insurers will put me on hold because I've been hospitalised for it before. The previous medical bills came up to over 5k despite me staying in B2 and C class wards. This is after medisave and medishield deduction! It took me more than six months to pay them off. 

Its been about six months since I was last hospitalised. I've been told by certain insurers that I would probably need to wait two years after my last hospisation before my application for an IP plan would be approved. I'm now at a loss. My outpatient bills are also pilling up and I'm debating if I should just stop treatment altogether. 

Other than Mental illness, I've got O&G and skin issues as well. These appts are coming up but I'm planning to skip them because of mounting bills. They are not life threatening so I guess I'll just try to live with the discomfort until I figure something out. 

If anyone has any ideas regarding health insurance or a way to reduce my medical bills, I'd really appreciate it. Thank you for reading.

But I witness this nonsense first hand myself. This woman favors guys in the most obvious manner. The people who are directly below her are all guys. Even though there are women of the same age group and similar caliber. They do not get to climb as fast as the men. 
Recently my batch mate got promoted even though he started only a bit earlier than me. He has regular special talks with the big boss herself. The boss discuss with him what plans she has for him and she has never ever initiated any type of talks with me. I am aware that I am softer spoken that my batch mate but I do work very hard, but I don’t think any of this matters and I am very tired. 
I like what I am doing but I honestly do not see a future with this type of big boss. She is unlikely to retire in the next 10-15 years so I guess I should cut losses early and leave the company....

It's one thing to test concepts slightly beyond what was taught in the lecture. If I can't get the answers, maybe I just don't understand it well enough. That's a ""me"" problem.  

But it's another thing to:
1. Cancel a lecture 1 hour before the lecture timing and post it on LumiNUS without any announcement  
2. Not upload the slides until 7 days later  
3. After the slides are uploaded, took another 3 days for the pre-recorded lecture to be up  
4. After the lecture is up, took another 2-3 days to gain access to view it (cos it was restricted)
5. Turns out the lecture that I waited 1.5 weeks to watch, did not cover all the content of the last lecture, and had unbearably soft audio.  

The content was tested. No explanation on why everything was so late. No response to email. How is that acceptable?!

As always, I got the same answers from them, “live your life bro, when is the time that you can enjoy all this things! You better enjoy this before you die”

You never see people that were dying meh? Most of them were with regret their life style that full of the above that i mentioned. Hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, HEART ATTACK, kidney disease, you name it! A complete set of fatal condition!

Exercising alot? Yoga? Pilates? Working out? Your routine life style? You think this people are totally healthy? Full of protein drinks, shakes, boosters? Wait til your kidney become stoney. Juices, vegan, colon cleansing, chia seeds, lemon water? Wait til your stomach become cancerous. Botox, micellar water, facial cream? Wait til you strike with melanoma

Being not healthy also not good, too healthy also not good. What else is there for us? Just not to be born is it? Just go to jungle and live there like tarzan ah? The humanity now is very weak, we are in the generation that the human wont live longer. No matter how good you take care of your genes thru your lifestyle, you are still dying at the age that your gene was set.

1097,"Hi everyone, not a confession, but I just wanted to lighten up the posts on this page, so here's Part 1 in a series of posts to guide you guys through exam period.
(Yes, this is a fictional story)


#1:
Today my first class is at Science. I like it when my classes are at Science. It has the nicest study areas, good food, but best of all is the walk from the MRT to FoS. There's something about this stroll that helps me gather my thoughts before my lessons.

As a Freshman who doesn't stay on campus, my days are mostly travelling to school, and going home. Sometimes if I'm lucky, I'll have a few friends to travel the journey home with. As I walk pass the NUH sign, I notice a group of Med students who don the NUS logo on their attire. The group consists of 1 boy and 2 girls, and they're laughing over something that I can't make out. Seeing them so cheerful and at ease around friends gives me a slight tinge of regret for not staying in a hall or RC, and now I have no one to spend my days with. The only thing giving me the strength to go to school each day is in the hopes that today I'll meet someone to share my moments with. Someone who can take me out of this constant drag each day and make my school days filled with joy and anticipation.

""Oof!"" Lost in my daze, I bumped right into a girl, causing her to drop her notes she was carrying.

""So sorry,"" I quickly helped her to pick up some of the stuff on the floor. As I passed the stack of notes back to her, I realised some of the notes were for GER.

""You taking GER too?""

""Yeah, the exam's this week huh."" Her voice was soft and gentle. As I looked into her eyes, my heart gave a quick leap. I don't have high standards, but gosh she sure was pretty. I tried not to stare at the way her brown hair fell just at her shoulders, highlighting her collarbones which were just visible over the black ""NUS"" shirt that she was wearing.

""Uh.. yeah, here's your stuff."" I quickly looked away and smiled, hopefully not creeping her out.

""Thanks so much!"" She walked off before I could think of anything else.

I tried not to look too affected as I continued walking to class.


Disclaimer: Other than the places mentioned, this story is the work of fiction.

Hope that this was a good read! Do let me know in the comments if you want to see a Part 2, or more of these type of work. I hope that I can bring a refreshing tone to this page.

1105,"In light of the recent passing of K-pop stars Sulli and Goo Hara, I am reminded of the time when I was still in JC, and I felt like giving up my life. It is that sudden spur of the moment, when you feel as though ""you don't deserve to be treated that way"".

I had taken on a leadership position in my school's choir, which required me to lead an acapella ensemble in the national anthem from time to time. The intense choir practice schedules left me with a damaged vocal chord, so I started asking other leaders to assume the role of leading the acapella choir instead. Despite explaining to others about my current vocal condition, they were quick to criticize that I had instead tried to push responsibilities away. Over time, I fell into depression and once broke down in front of the choir. One of the members took my situation onto social media and mocked me for that. I nearly ended my life that day.

Looking back now, I wished I did not take other's opinions of me to heart, but I was merely 17 years old and did not know how to process such a situation. I wish people could be kinder and more supportive, and not make nasty comments and assumptions about things that they do not understand.

Yet for girls there’s no social pressure to keep up with appearance (hence average looking) and they have equal standing with guys unlike other countries. Its kinda optional to chip in to the family finance and they can happily buy their branded bags. 

For guys it’s kinda like responsibility without the benefits and for girls it’s benefits without the responsibility.

The thing is, she comes from this place that is currently undergoing a lot of political and social turbulence, and her views are drastically different from mine. That wasn't a problem, until recently she started talking about it in a group chat with many of our exchange friends. I have been ignoring her regular updates about the issue (which, to me, are from a rather radical perspective), and refrained from making comments because everyone should be entitled to their own opinions. However, one day I posted online about this video call we had among the group, which had nothing to do with politics except people reminding her to be safe. She reposted mine and added words hinting she had a group of foreign friends who were very supportive of her cause. I am really frustrated, because that was nowhere close to what we talked about during the call, nor my true opinion. It is ok for people to have their own stances, but I really hate to have words that I disagree with forced into my mouth. I kept quiet because she was so important to me during exchange and I don't want to quarrel with her, but this is really getting on my nerves. Should I continue ignoring all this?

1130,"I don't know what to do with my life. The post will be long, and please bear with me.

I have always been considered 'dumb' in Singapore's eyes. 

For PSLE, I was in the NA stream because my grades were horrible. Since then, my parents have always been disappointed in me because my brother was in the Express Stream.

Fast forward to N level, I got pretty good marks (13 points), but I could not make the cut of 12 points for the Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP). I could only go to Higher Nitec (ITE), but my mother was against it as she said that I would forever have a black mark on my education because I went to *ITE* (Boomer logic lol)

So she forced me to go for O level, where I failed badly, I got 32 points, and my Math was ungraded. I have always struggled with math, Chinese, and science. 

Even though my other subjects like humanities, English/Geography/Literature have always been in the As, but in Singapore's eyes, those subjects are irrelevant. Only Math/ Science is king. With 32 points and failing in math, I could not even make it to polytechnic. I had to go to ITE or retake O levels. I was feeling furious because if I had taken the higher nitec option, I would have gotten a chance to go to polytechnic. 

I wanted to retake O levels to get a chance to go to polytechnic. Once again, my mother came into the picture and put me in a private school to do International Baccalaureate. 

But since my O level results were so shit, they made me repeat Year 4 (or sec 4 basically) And once again at the end of the year, I could not cope because being in NA stream, I was never given a chance to do Additional Mathematics or Pure Sciences. However, in this school, I was forced to take Additional Mathematics, Pure Chemistry, and Pure Biology. If I was failing Mathematics and Combined Science, how can I deal with these subjects?

I was struggling badly, once again. I had never learned Additional Mathematics in my entire life nor taken any Pure Sciences, so most of the teachers were wondering why I was there, and some students kept saying how 'dumb' I was to be older than them, but not know these 'simple' subjects. The school wanted to kick me out because they said my results were so bad. My mother begged them to let me stay. So they did. 

Fast forward to after completing the IB, where I had JUST passed by the skin of my teeth with 26 points, IB is out of 45 points. The passing mark is 24. I could not make it to any local universities, plus I did not study Chinese or take Additional Mathematics for IB. 

Once again, my parents were disappointed because both of them are from NUS, and they always had high hopes for both of their children. My father regularly says what a disappointment I am and how embarrassed he is of me. 

He always compares me to his nieces and nephews, says how much smarter they are than me and how stupid I am.

I just wanted to stop studying and work. My mother told me I HAVE to go to university. Otherwise, I will die poor, and she will disown me because I am a failure.

I tried applying to 3 overseas universities, and I got rejected for everything except for one, which was Australia. I had high hopes for Canada as the course I wanted was Geography, but my parents said no because that course could not make money.

But the course (that my mother chose) was something I knew that I would struggle in. It's heavily Science and Mathematics based, and after many experiences, I know that I will most likely fail and struggle because these subjects are something I am not strong in.

The thing is, my mother has applied for everything and I will be leaving next year, but I do not want to. I know it will be challenging, and my parents told me I have to pay them back for every single cent spent. I did not even want to go to university in the first place, and now I have this burden placed on me. I'm scared, and I don't know what to do. 

I will be all alone in a foreign country, and I can predict that I will be struggling very hard. It's not that I'm lazy, please understand me. I am just not wired to understand Math/Sciences, but I am pretty strong in other aspects like English/Literature/Geography. To my parents, with a degree in any of these subjects, they are useless, and I will not be able to amount to anything in life. (According to them, that is.)

I'm just a little bit miserable, and I don't know what I want to do with my life. I'd instead choose to work than continuing to study.

1131,"Dear Prof Ben,

I have been working in my current job close to 2 years. Seeing all my colleague leaving one by one, it always make me feel I should be next.

Pro: Office near my house, flexible timing, able to learn a lot and new skill as the turn over in office is fast. So most of the time I will need to take over their job after they left.

Cons: Low pay(no increase as company didn't have much project, might afraid the next job won't have much increase, based on my current pay), no enough manpower

Would love to have some advice should I continue staying or start looking for new opportunities? I only concern the next job is worst then my current one.

Thank you!

1142,"With reference to OP from #72867 and #72600 and the comments and advice given, I was just wondering why our society holds such disparate views between men not being emotionally ready for relationships as opposed to women facing the same issue.

For example, a woman stating that she is not emotionally ready for a relationship is seen as ""understandable"" and should be ""given space"" to think and process through her emotions. 

For a man that states that he is not emotionally ready for a relationship, however, he is immediately labelled as ""out to play with others' emotions"" and ""manipulative"" as seen in the comments of the post above.

About a year ago, an NUS girl struck up a conversation with me (also a girl) on a Circle Line train towards Kent Ridge thinking I was a fellow student.

I have been with my gf for abit over a year now. We recently broke up 2 months back over some petty argument, but it was a clean and mutual break, which I didn't feel really bad about as I felt that the r/s is already nearing its end. However, less than a week she came back begging me to stay and she said she regretted breaking up and that she just kept crying and she can't live without me, so I got back with her to give it another shot. 

Within these 2 months, I really tried my best to be a good boyfriend and to spend time with her, we even had plans to go overseas during this winter holiday break (she's not from NUS tho). But right now, in the midst of exams, I'm wondering if i really did the right thing by staying because I really don't feel that I love her anymore, and by staying I just feel that I'm cheating her of her feelings. And I really don't foresee a future with her in this country due to her family background and problems, mainly money wise.

What's even more fxxked up is that I've actually fallen for another girl, she really reminded me of my gf when I first met her, but she's cuter, smarter and definitely better-looking. She's has those attribute that I want to find in a gf/future wife. Tbh, I never thought that I would be in this position where I would fall for another girl while I am still in a r/s (this is my first r/s actually), and I’ve always thought “why would people cheat?”. But right now for me, I just don’t feel attracted to my gf anymore, and I would prefer to be single right now so that I can chase this new girl. (I don’t believe in dating more than 1 person at the same time)

So that’s my situation, please give me some advice on what I should do… I know somethings just aren’t meant to be in life, but I would feel bad either ways, if I break up or if I stay.

The post resonates with my situation so well! 

But I feel like sometimes as introverts it's not that we don't enjoy being alone? But more like we're the only one who's like that there, so it's expected that we try to conform and become just like them- noisy, rowdy and edging into rude. 

It feels like so because you enjoying alone-time by yourself makes it seems like there's something wrong with you. 

Sure, sometimes we queitly hope we can be sociable like that, at least to a moderate extent. But, that's not who we are? Why is it wrong to be introverted? Why must i feel so bad? Why must i put on a show and pretend like I'm one of them?

I think it just is really important to have someone else there who is just like you and understands you or at least have similar interest. I just am completely turned off by their convo. I don't have someone like that here right now but it really helped when i did. But then again, it's not like you could just get another introverted colleague. 

The worst kind of feeling is being included, while feeling damn alone. 

And like you know you need to change, show more interest, learn to talk to them or something. But like though they don't say it, you clearly know they don't enjoy talking to you, they don't get any joy out of talking to you. After a few times, you look at their sian face then you're like, suah, I'm not the problem, you're not the problem. The problem lies in there being a 'we'.

Coming out of the comfort zone to these people, to me, means to just pretend to be someone I'm not. To feign interest and paste on that plastic smile. 

But I find that speaking slower and using a lower voice helps. It gives a false sense of confidence. Then they think they're on the right track and begin to ask you more questions along that line.

I've been with my boyfriend for coming to 10 years now. We are like best friends and lovers, absolutely in sync and seemingly all is good. 

However, I feel disloyal and need some genuine advice. 

At his family events, we would always meet this cousin of his - a few years younger than him and extremely attractive (my type)/also guy I would have gone for as well.

However, he has been asking me when I'll be coming over/where and how soon, repeatedly. 

I shared this with my boyfriend to see if I'm reading into things, and he believed his cousin asks out of curiosity. He senses nothing and I dont say too much as well. But I just canttttt stooopp looking, imagining and thinking if his cousin is indeed interested in me and if/when I go over...

Most of you guys mentioned that texting might be the issue, but that's not what I feel? If he wants his space, I would totally respect that, and I'm not one to double text often. I honestly feel like we don't text so much to the extent that he would need his space? He doesn't work much, so most of his time spent were mostly at home, family, and friends. 
So here's an update about what's going on. Feel free to skip if you are too lazy to read! 

He doesn't really enjoys talking about our personal stuff, and he claimed that he is lazy and said he would eventually tell me slowly and surely. He wants to take it slow and see how things goes instead of establishing any title or be in a committed relationship. I pestered him quite a bit to get him to talk about what's going on. He finally told me he isn't ready for a committed relationship, saying that he doesn't like the quarrels and argument that comes with it. I totally understand it and we have never quarreled before, as I don't like to find fault or confront a person directly unless I really need to. 

Also, I feel like he would not be emotionally available for me. That is fine to me as of now, I don't see it as a big issue as I also feel lazy to share about my personal life unless he asked. I just kept assuring him that its ok to be honest with me if I'm just an fwb, or if he isn't serious with me. I told him that I would rather he be 100% honest with me than to toy with my feelings or led me on. However, he kept reassuring me to trust him, that he isn't toying with me. He claims that he just wanted someone by his side. 

Whenever I tried to make plans with him, he seemed uninterested in carrying out and would come up with excuses. The only time he asked me out, was mostly to stayover. He told me he just enjoy chilling at home with me and watch shows, and that he feel that not having sex is fine. However, it still seems shady right? So now, am i safe to say that it's pretty obvious I probably meant nothing to him, and that he might really be toying with my feelings, and just treated me as an fwb? Or should I just trust him?

We are from the same clique and there’s been a running joke that we are an item and we kind of play along with it, but I dont know why recently I’ve been wanting something more than friendship? Do y’all reckon I have a chance to turn this into more? Can guys joke along like this if they have no feelings at all?

1176,"As a european exchange student I'm quite disgusted at the the employment practices here in Singapore. Never have I seen people so scared of their employers, willing to be mistreated or employers so happy to low ball younger graduates and derive sadistic pleasure from it. HR is one of the worst where they dont seem to have any sense of the harshness and emptiness of their behaviour. My advice to younger graduates would be to move out of singapore if you can, to better labour markets like Europe where they respect you as a person and employers dont have too much power. Guys, if you want to be in the club of rich nations, you better start acting like one. Having just nice buildings doesnt help.

Do understand something my friend, it is easy to do well in engineering because everything is absolute, there will always be one answer to the question. Whereas for business, we have to write reports and essay-like answers for one question. Now think about it, which one is harder?

1179,"To OP #72798:

I actually have a differing view from most of the rest. You already mentioned that both of you have different personalities - you are extrovert and he is an introvert. Usually an introvert recharges by being alone, whereas you get more energised being around people. One of the common misunderstandings would be to think that there is a problem when an introvert keeps quiet. That is just the way they are.

Try approaching it from a point of view where you share about how you genuinely feel - that you are sharing your issues with him because you see a relationship as working things out in life together. I think what you shared here is very good and that it is something you should be speaking to him about (that you are confused, and would like to spend more time; and that you feel that if it is not fulfilled, you are worried about the relationship, but because it is important to you that is why you are speaking to him about it).

It is easy to give up, but every relationship will have its problems. It takes strong perseverance to work it out.

Would I be an asshole if I break up with my SO because they’re bisexual? I love my SO very much, we are in a serious relationship - discussed BTO, travelled with the families and even decided to get engaged in Year 4... Breaking up feels extreme, especially since there is no immediate problem. My SO has always been open about being bi and has slept with many people of the same gender before we started dating so I don’t think I’m crazy for being a little worried that they’re fully homosexual and not bisexual. I really have no problem with their sexuality - I just don’t want to be 45 and divorced because my partner has left me the minute same-sex marriage becomes legalised.

Am I a terrible person for feeling this way? I’ll admit my understanding of sexuality is limited (for now, really working on that). I’d like to ask for reassurance - what can I do to feel less insecure and to get my partner to help me out? I want to have THAT conversation but I don’t know where to start...

My best friend is in NUS and is one of the sweetest person I ever known, who would rather secretly stare at her crush than talk to them. Recently, she started seeing a guy - he was taking her out for dates every week, making promises of where to take her after finals, texting her... You know the drill. She didn’t tell me about him (I only found out about him when I saw them them by chance on a date), but she was the happiest I seen her in a long time. Suddenly, after sending her home... He one up and disappeared. No text, no calls, no replies, nothing. 

I didn’t even know what was going on until I called her and realised she was crying. After asking, she finally told me he disappeared, and was wondering what she did wrong (spoiler: probably nothing at all). While I was beyond mad and cursing him, guess what? She was still defending him, saying he might be busy, saying it was reading week, and being worried that something might have happened. We opened Instagram together and low and behold, he was alive and well, posting about studying in school with his friends.

I’ve known her for many years and this was the first time I’ve seen her so sad... And it’s all YOUR fault. I mean if you’re truly busy you could always send her a text telling her you gonna MIA. If you wanted to stop seeing her and end dating, just tell her it’s not working out. Ghosting her without an explanation is cowardly after all the time you spent together! This is why NUS science guys have a bad rep and keep ending up in scandals, after all, the lot of you seem to be the same kind.

Just let me rant here. 

Sometimes i feel kind of tired of this relationship. My bf doesn't ask me anything, about my day, about my plans (whether I'm going out or anything), or what i am doing etc. Sometimes the whole day we would only converse not more than 5 lines, that wouldn't even be able to say it's 5 sentence. If i don't start a topic, he won't either. On those rare times when he text me first, i would be so happy. 

I spoke to him about it. He just say there's nothing special going on in his life. And next question i would think is 'then aren't you interested about my life? Or what am i thinking? Don't you want to know more about me, just like i would want to know everything about you.' Else, he would say that he isn't someone who is good at texting. Else, he would say that he is tired from work (which i can empathize to an extend). 

BUT when we meet in person, we are the other way round. He would be the one chatting more, while I'm usually the listener. He would fill me up on what he have been doing since we last met - sometimes in details, sometimes briefly. In person he is a bf that always make sure to send me home and is good to me and i alwayd enjoy being out with him. 

I thought to meet him more frequently, assuming that he is really not a good texter. But lifeshits makes us difficult to do so frequently.  The max was always twice in a week and it's difficult to do so every week. So it's kind of hard to test out this theory. 

Sorry for ranting so much. But in summary, girl is usually the one initiating convo in texts. Guy rarely starts convo. Guy reply girl but sometimes it's also a short reply which makes girl difficult to continue the convo. Girl can't do HTHT with guy frequently because guy thinks it's the girl thinking too much/being too emo and guy is uncomfortable expressing emotional stuff. 

Advice pls?

1186,"*WARNING LONG POST AHEAD* 

This story involves 2 other people. For simplicity, I shall name them:

A - my childhood best friend
B - the love of my life 

I have known A almost my whole life, growing up in the same neighbourhood, going to the same primary, secondary & poly together. We would usually meet up most of the days since we only stayed 5 minutes apart. Be it for movies, meals, playing Basketball, hanging out at the park to talk about life etc. We were basically like siblings. He was blessed with good looks and I would always feel inferior to him. He could easily talk to girls as he was an extrovert, while I was completely the opposite. 

I met B when I was in secondary school, we met by an unusual situation whereby her best friend and my table partner had feelings for each other, so we would try to arrange for ways for them to meet after school. B was the first girl I ever talked to. We would then go on to be “text buddies” throughout our secondary life. I began to develop feelings for her along the way but never managed to express it due to the fear of rejection. She was the one girl I would talk to day & night, sharing our daily experiences with each other. Occasionally going out for movies and meals. We probably could have ended up together if I had a little bit of courage to ask her. (Bear in mind that I am the extreme case of an introvert, so it’s really difficult for me to express my feelings to others.) But I was contented with just being her friend at that point of time.

Time flew and we were eventually in poly, I was still in touch with B but our conversations would shorten due to being out of things to talk about. This is when things would start to get a little complicated. During my poly days, my friendship with A started to deteriorate as he decided to join the MLM craze happening at that time. He would occasionally ask me to join as he claimed that his company had good plans for high returns. My parents always told me to stay away from people like that and I would do so. But 1 day, I decided to just trust the friendship we forged over the years and had a go and invested in 1 of the plans he said was “fool proof”, hoping to get easy cash but just waiting out a couple of months. The time came when he promised me the returns would be delivered but of course, it never did. I decided to let it go by since he also invested in that scam scheme and continued my friendship with him, since he was also in the same boat. But of course, my friendship with him was not as solid as before, as I would decline to meet him as frequently as before. 

Soon after, A contacted B through social media and they started to chat. I was curious as to why A would suddenly want to talk to B, but I didn’t ask him about it cause he told me B was never his type since Secondary days. I decided not to bat an eye cause I wasn’t afraid of A ever liking B, since A knew how much B meant to me. At most, we could all become closer together and hang out even more right? Well, I was stupid to hope it was that case.

Fast forwarding a couple of weeks, A called me one night at asked “Hey if by some reason, I happen to catch feeling for B, will you get angry?” At that exact point I already knew, that he had feelings for her, if not why so would he even ask me that question? I of course responded with “Of course I will, you always knew my feelings towards her right?” He replied with “Yes of course. Alright see you soon.” 

I then saw through social media that they would “flirt” with each other through every tweet or post and began to think that they might actually already be together. But both A & B was reluctant to make it public as they were afraid it would hurt me. 

Following a few days, B suddenly asked me if I wanted to meet up and “catch up on life”. At that point I was sure that they were together and she wanted to break the news to be about them being together. I pretended not to know and proceeded anyway, hoping for a small miracle it wasn’t true and would favour me in some way. 

The day came when all hells would break loose for me. I met her at our usual meeting place and “caught up on life”, laughing and talking about the past incidents and the mutual TV shows we would watch. Towards the end of the meeting, I could sense she was a bit awkward, thinking of ways to break the news of them being together. Hence I just went ahead and decided to tell her, “Hey look, I know you and A are together...” She looked me in the eye for a few seconds, stunned and then proceeds to say, “Yes we are, I hope you understand and accept that. Hope it doesn’t affect our friendships.” 

Hearing those words, which I already knew to begin with, had affected me more that I thought it would. I was boiling with rage inside and in that heat of the moment, I said some terrible stuff like, “You know you aren’t going to last long with him right? He is a player and always plays with feelings. You are never going to be happy with him, and you can tell him that the friendship is over and he can go to hell. All the best to you anyway.” I immediately walked out of the restaurant after saying those words, without hearing what she had to say or what her reaction was, cause I was afraid I was only going to make matters worse if I stayed on. 

Once I reached home, I decided to block them both from all my social media’s since I didn’t even want to see A’s face. 

It was been a good 5 years since that incident. Recently I have been having dreams about B, all happy dreams such as us going out together, talking to each other again. I couldn’t help myself but to want to find a way to talk to B again. I can’t accept losing B in my life cause of actions done by A. Till this day, I regret blocking B and losing her. 

Oh and please note that A and B are not together anymore as I have mutual friends who would update me about B time to time. They broke up in that year they got together. I really miss B a lot, and am desperate to find a way back in her life. But I’m not sure if she will forgive me for what I did/said to her in our last meeting. 

So please, I need some advice on what I should do. Should I just let things be as they are now? If not, what should I do to get B back in my life?

1194,"Since young, I have always been socially-deemed as unattractive. People always bullied me because I was damn ugly and fat. Also, my love life was literally non-existent, all the girls that I liked never liked me back. Mind you, I was really trying my hardest to get a gf, but to no avail. Due to my image, I had zero self-esteem. I was very depressed and sad most of the time, and I just felt very empty and I just wanted to feel something. 

After army, I got into NUS Biz. I didn't get the chance to apply for FOPs so I had little to no friends in school. I tried signing up for Aphrodite lately but after getting both matches, they immediately ghosted me after seeing my profile picture, why do people always judge me by my looks first...

Last year, however, I met the girl of my dreams. I went for NUS Bizad Charity Run 2019 alone last year. I wanted to motivate myself to be healthier and also hope the I could meet some new people. During the run, I accidentally tripped and fell at the basketball court area. Even though it wasn't that serious, I was pretty shagged out from the run and laid there for a while. Suddenly, this really chio girl who was in the middle of running stopped and approached me, asking if I was okay. I was super shocked because I never thought someone like her would approach me.

She helped me up and kept asking if I was ok. I told her I was fine and that I could continue running and wanted to finish it. She then offered to run the rest of the route together and wahhh I was literally damn happy but tried to look calm. She was wearing a pair of light pink Nike shoes with the blue shirt. And not to be creepy or anything, but she smelt really good too. She was chatty and bubbly throughout the run, and we talked about life in NUS. She was also from Biz. Sadly, the run ended and she really made 5 km seem like 1 km. Even though we talked for a bit, my dumbass couldn't bring myself to ask for her name, and she didn't ask me for mine either. I have never been able to get her out of my head ever since, I really wish I can see her again. 

 I hope that I will be able to find her through NUSWhispers and that she will be reading this. To that girl: I really hope that that you have signed up again for the upcoming BCR 2020. If you haven't I hope you will do it in hopes of being able to run together again. I will definitely be on the lookout for those light pink nike shoes at the starting line at 5pm outside MRB :')

1195,"To those of you on NUSWhispers taking a break or a breather from finals revision (me too!), here’s a story you can read while relaxing and decide whether you want to believe it or not! I can’t really remember what we were talking about (it’s funny how conversations can veer from one to another and you completely forget what was the topic you were initially talking about) but it’s my mum’s recount of a story that happened back when she was still working for a leading local supermarket chain (not gonna name it but it is pretty obvious).

Here’s some background to the story:
Most supermarket outlets back in the day were not yet made 24 hours, so the night shift supervisor would be in charge of locking up the store after all the workers had packed up and left. The supervisor would be responsible for setting the store alarm (in case someone tries to break in) and locking the metal shutter gate of the outlet, holding the store key throughout the night to open the outlet again for the morning shift workers the next morning (I can’t remember the exact details, but the supervisor just holds onto the key for the night).The metal shutter gate in the past had to be pulled down and locked manually by hand, unlike some stores today which can be done with the push of a button. In the case when the alarm trips in the middle of the night, the supervisor holding the key would have to come down to the store immediately and open the store to check what caused the alarm to trip, accompanied by security guards and the police. Sometimes it might be rats or a bird, sometimes it may also be caused by the stocks falling over when they were not arranged properly previously etc. 

It is protocol for either the security guard or a police officer to be standing at the front when the metal shutter door is opened in case someone really broke into the store and attacked them. This piece of instruction is known to all workers in the supermarket and is even mentioned when new staff is trained. Another thing to note would be that the security guards and police officers would wear their hat/cap when entering the premises to investigate such occurrences due to the belief that the police insignia on the hat/cap works almost like a powerful “shield” of sorts that can ward off anything “dirty” that could be causing the disturbance (not sure about this, might be just a pantang but I asked my dad and uncles and they said they believed in it and proceeded to tell me their army stories lol). 

So one day, my mum’s supervisor came into work and told her that she had just come from the hospital and that something had happened to her close friend whom was the night shift supervisor at the neighbouring Rochor Road branch. Apparently, that branch had always faced frequent incidents of the alarm tripping, only for the key holder to travel all the way down to investigate and find that there was nothing that could have possibly caused it to go off. The previous night, the store alarm at the Rochor Road branch had tripped several times throughout the night, causing the supervisor to travel to and fro from her house to the outlet several times to open the store and reset the alarm. On the third time when the alarm tripped, the supervisor again went down to reset the alarm. Perhaps she, as well as the security guard and police officers were getting frustrated, thinking that the alarm was faulty and that the disturbance was a total nuisance, so the officers stood back and waited for her to unlock the metal shutter gate. When she unlocked it, the shutter released upward suddenly at a fast speed as though it had just been oiled, which was unusual as the shutter usually required some strength to push it upward. As the supervisor looked at the shutter going upward, she was shocked and entered a trancelike state, unable to speak or move. The police then sent her to a nearby hospital. When her colleagues went to visit her at the hospital, she recounted to them that she saw a really tall woman towering above her, just standing there. She said she could only see the woman from waist down as the woman was of a very, very tall and that was when she entered her trance and could not remember anything else. Soon after, she was transferred to IMH. This supervisor did not have any history of mental/medical illnesses and was known to be hardworking, cheerful and talkative, but after this incident it was like she became another person.

When my mum’s supervisor went to see her at IMH, she said that Rochor supervisor would often tell her that she was very afraid and she could see many strangers walking about her room ( but she occupied a solitary room), or black figures/shadows that were standing/hiding behind the door and peeking out at her. My mother was initially skeptical of it, until one day she received a call from the Rochor supervisor asking to speak to my mother’s supervisor who was in a meeting at that time. She then asked my mother to relay a message to her supervisor, saying that she was very afraid of the strangers walking about in her room and the dark figures seemed to approach her at night and were getting nearer and nearer to her, asking my mother to tell her supervisor to come and visit her quickly before abruptly hanging up. My mother said that her voice was like a whisper and the tone was almost hushed and a little high-pitched, and my mum freaked out after putting down the phone. Soon after, the Rochor supervisor returned to work, but personally asked for a demotion to be a cashier. Two weeks later, she again asked to be demoted to be a sales assistant. After about a month, she resigned and left the company, never contacting any of her former colleagues again. Many of her colleagues tried unsuccessfully to contact her, and those that succeeded said that she had checked herself into IMH again. 

Personally, I am both skeptical yet spooked by this story. Perhaps she was tired from all that travelling and saw something that was not there at all. After all, the mind is extremely powerful in playing tricks on one’s eyes, but her behaviour after the incident is enough to creep me out. Anyway, I went to Google possible tall spirits of ghosts and found one that fits her description – Hantu Galah. This post is getting a bit long, so I think I’ll stop here! Go google this on your own and decide if you believe it or not!

1196,"Half a year ago, I got together with my boyfriend who is a working adult through an online dating app. We had very different personalities, he was quiet while I was bubbly and sometimes even hyper. 

Starting of the relationship was sweet as any couples were, but recently he started to stop meeting me claiming that he was tired because of work. I understand that the life of a working adult was never easy so I just spent a significant amount of time alone. Recently he has gotten worse where we only met once for a whole month and he claimed that he needed more alone time. I was feeling quite stressed over school and projects and wanted to talk to him about it but he told me not to add on to his stress. 

I know in life it’s not all sugar for love but he does not seem to be making an effort to stay in my life any further. I try to reach out to him to know what he is thinking but he just closed himself up, leaving me confused. When I confront him if he still wanted to be together he would deem me as insecure and trying to stir things up when everything is going okay. I started to question myself if requesting for him to meet me once every two weeks is too much? 

I think I am about to give up on this relationship already. My friends all told me to just leave him and that I deserve better than this kind of half assed love from my bf.

1203,"I've been going for internship interviews even throughout this difficult period exams and all. There are bound to have some companies that require you to do some studying beforehand (for eg R&D) and they always like people who are independent. They don't like to ""spoon feed"" interns. If we are going to do everything by ourselves then what's the point in interning? They always make sound like we can churn out anything the company wants by ourselves. I'm really skeptical about internships and I don't really look forward to it... I hope to have at least proper guidance so I can really do what they expect me to do...

Also just to add... Why do NUS even offer companies to pay us a range of $800-$1000. Isn't it better to just start at $1000... Traveling across SG is very expensive and engineering companies are always at Jurong or jurong island or tuas... When I ask how much the pay is, companies will always say things like NUS recommends $800 and above so we are going to pay you $800. Of course everyone in the right mind would hire interns at the 'lower bound price'. Cheap labour to produce the work that their staff can do. So can't we just start at $1000...

However, due to finals drawing closer, more and more people are using the libraries. While I understand that certain libraries have better facilities/atmosphere/vibes or whatever, sometimes I find it frustrating when I can't get a seat at med lib. The thing is at least 1/3 of the people there aren't from surrounding faculties like pharm, nursing etc... While there isn't anything wrong with that I just find it annoying when they are not here and yet saving spaces for them and their friends using their belongings. This seat hogging has to stop. You're depriving other healthcare/science faculties from a. seat in their own library.

It is true that lousy means lousy and hes just stating the fact but given his position in the department as the Deputy Head of Education, is it even ethically right for him to make this remark straight in my face? Oh did I mention, he said it in front of my friend too, where both of us are in his office. 

Furthermore, there are subsequent times when I need to consult him on certain matters  at his office and his reply when I emailed him was, “You again...........”. Oh wells, is that even professional?

So I’m still in Uni (Year 2) and he’s already working (just graduated from NUS). We used to hang out twice or thrice or even four to five times a week when we were both schooling but now I don’t even see him for two, sometimes three weeks. When I do, it’s sometimes only for ten to fifteen minutes when I visit him at home. When he first started working, we used to make the effort to meet for lunch or dinner often but now he's so busy with work (major events coming up) and I have exams and projects and I'm stressed and he's stressed and the distance makes me feel sad. Like I see the couples who crash each other's lectures or just hanging out 24/7 on Instastory and while that was never us, we led our own fairly separate lives because different schools, and the age gap but it still kinda makes me miss him. And I'm always so worried that he will meet someone else outside at work meanwhile I doubt I'll leave him for anyone in school because he's already TOP-tier husband material. 

I don't even let him pay, we still go Dutch and give and take during dates because I don't want him to feel like I am a burden. We also fight because I get jealous of him being so close to his colleagues (even his male ones). We also don’t have as much in common anymore, his problems are all so “adultish"" - he's even started talking about marriage and BTO and while I am excited by that prospect, I can't help but feel a little intimidated (I'm only 20!)I love him so much, what can I do to keep our relationship strong?

then, everything after that seems scarier. you get a new place, face your spouse nearly 24/7, and then maybe get some babies. so many things can go wrong. what if your choice for a spouse was a mistake? what if your kids are little devils? how is it that no one else seems to find this drastic change in life a scary thought?

1222,"My boyfriend (23M) and I (21F) have been going out for sometime and things are great. I've been with multiple guys in my life (sexually) and therefore have multiple experiences, whereas for him he has never been with any one sexually (although he is so hot). Anyway, I'll keep this short. 

So we both know what we like in sex; I am very submissive while he is very dominant. Once, when drunk, things got hot and we had a very very good time except that we couldn't fk properly because we were both too drunk. Well we finally tried to do it again once sober when things got hot and steamy again. 

I was mostly on top of him making most of the moves and I noticed from the very beginning already that he seemed to have not much clue as to what to do/ how to continue. It was a bit weird for me because I am not used to making almost all the moves and being on. top most of the time. But knowing that he might be worried about it as he doesn't have much experience, I just tried to keep things going and  kind of guide him at times. Then he began to do more and you know getting and top and all that but right before we were going to fk, I noticed he slowed down and there were moments he would just look at me for a really long time or look into space. 


Well, I started asking him if things were fine, etc but he just said things like yeah don't worry it's fine. But clearly there was something wrong because he continuedhaving this worried look. I slowed down and got up, looked him in the eyes and told him to not worry and that he can tell me anything. Finally, he told me that he was really worried that sex would turn out shitty, that he wouldn't be able to please me, thathe felt like a baby beside me because he didn't know what to do. 

I just tried to comfort him, telling him that it didn’t matter to me, to focus on himself, and that we can get better with practice. That the optimal sex between 2 different people is always different. However, no matter what I say, I can’t get him to stop worrying... 

Please guys, is there anything I can do/say to help him feel better? If you were in his position, what would help? Should I try to guide him more (initiate more)? Thanks in advance everyone. Will update. 

Tldr; great relationship but boyfriend worried to have sex with me because I have experience but he doesn’t.

1223,"Disclaimer: this is a post purely to rant 

So my colleagues were having lunch and they were essentially complaining that they were broke and how our salaries are too low etc. 
One of them spend like 2k on ordering supper. 
Which got me thinking. I grew up in a family that was quite frugal, so pardon me if I sound misery. But recently even when my friends meet up they complain about not being able to save 
But if you want to spend 2k on ordering supper (which is not a basic need) then are you really blaming your pay for not sustaining this lifestyle?

I mean I tried calculating my own expenses per month
700 allowance to parents 
I eat breakfast and dinner at home - lunch my workplace has hawker centre and food court, so 5bucks per day usually, 20 buck once or twice a week, 300 a month for working 5 days a week
I don't drink bubbletea or coffee or tea because i like water
phone bills- 20 a month 
electricity and water - living with parents 
CLothes- maybe 50 a month
transport- lucky to live near work so 2bucks a day, 50-60 bucks a month
movies- 20bucks a month
eating out on weekends- assuming I eat out 2 times a month (becuase my work is usually too busy and I like to nua at home) it's 80 per month

In total: 700 allowance +300 food + 50bucks transport + clothes 50bucks +100 per month for entertainment = 1200 bucks a month

Assuming average fresh grad pay of 4-5k a month, I really fail to see why people are living month by month? even saving 2k shouldn't be too hard. And a lot of my friends aren't even giving their parents allowance lei. And I'm not even counting performance bonuses and overtime pay, which should be another 5k per year at least (year end bonus should have 13th month for most companies right?) 
Holidays are also technically a want but assuming we put 5k a year aside to travel, it still shouldn't be as abysmal as they say.
Of course I am blessed- I don't have a family to feed, my student loans are paid off during my schooling years. But most of my friends are also not married yet and their student loans are also paid by parents? (based on what they tell me) 
Am I not enjoying life enough? Becuase I don't count owning a car into the picture- but I really feel in singapore car is more of a want than a need? Or is it just a singaporean thing when we like to spend on a lot of wants and call it necessities? I love food too but I think 2k on supper is like... are you eating gold?

1229,"I need help to get along more with my parents. Long story ahead skip if uninterested! Background: my parents only speak Chinese and I usually converse in English with everyone else (including my siblings) since young so the only chance I have to speak Mandarin is with my parents, which is not often. Doesn’t help that I hated Chinese as a subject back in school so my conversational Chinese sucks despite having Chinese-speaking parents. I would often have to ask people to translate simple words because even though I can understand perfectly, when it comes to speaking, most of the time I translate from English in my head first. When I was younger, my parents would always leave my siblings and I alone at home and would rarely answer our questions (“children don’t need to know”, whenever we ask them what they did at work they would just brush us away). Now, all three of us siblings are quiet and introverted, though not sure if it was due to our upbringing but mehh. Our family was never close-knitted but got along with each others’ presence ok.

I was the middle child that always tried to spend time with them (compared to my siblings) and tried to converse with them whenever I could and helped out with their business. I was the “good child”, doing whatever they asked me to and never talked back to them. I also had relatively a lot of freedom in my life in a traditional Chinese family. But problems started when I was 18: they started to nag at me every single day, micro-managing my diet and whatever they say to me was “why are you like this? why are you not eating this? you are so dumb…” and they started to ask me where I was going and what I was doing. Compared to the past when they never gave a damn about my life (eg they forgot about my birthday once and they only remembered the next day and they never cared about my school results), I was very confused about the sudden nagging and criticisms that I guess I started to push them away and get annoyed at them. It got so bad that I never wanted to eat dinner at home because they would always criticise what and how I eat. They kept nitpicking at everything I do at the dinner table, especially when I had friends over they would nag and compare me with my friends, making us very uncomfortable. So, at 18-19yo I resented my parents. 

After the numerous times of replying to them in an annoyed tone, my mum gave me a talk about my behaviour and asked why I was doing this — and the problem was I was so bad at Chinese I just couldn’t explain it well. Also, my family doesn’t talk about this kind of stuff so it was very uncomfortable for me so I brushed them away. I guess as time went by, my Chinese became even worse in uni and my parents and I have nothing to talk about now. We literally have no common interests and we have A LOT of conflicting views on issues. Also, whenever I try to talk about my life or mention anything that troubles me in an attempt to make conversation, they would twist it against me and it’ll become a nagging session and I’ll regret even opening my mouth. 

I know my parents care for me a lot, and I care about them too. Just that it’s so difficult to be close to them and whenever I see people having close relationships with their parents, I envy them so much. How do you become close with parents whom you have nothing to talk about? 

ps. now I try to spend time with them going grocery shopping but they always try to rush through the shopping so it doesn’t help that much. also, going on holidays didn’t work too because we have different interests and wanted to do different things overseas.

But there are also many other examples. There are people who quit their white collar jobs and were successful being hawkers/ chefs/ small business owners and these jobs don't need a degree. There are also countless stories of people with only A level or diploma who are successful in their careers.

He knows of it and say that i will have to find a way to convince my parents. He doesn't pressure me and seems to be okay with dating secretly. But sometimes, he will say I should just let my parents know and face it. If it really comes to a no-go, then we will face it and end the relationship. I don't really know what he is thinking. He talks about his friends but so far i haven't met his friends yet. I have let him met mine though. Sometimes it feels really one sided because I'm the one taking the initiative. But i thought maybe it's because of my parents that he is behaving this way. Any advices? Should i convince my parents first then see how far this relationship will go, or should i just let go?

1247,"After breaking up with my ex, it took me almost three years to get over the past. He even got married recently. I thought I would never be able to feel in love again. I'm already 25. 

This semester, I met a guy friend, whom I was friend with two years ago, very randomly in another lecture but we hardly talked. 

One day, I came to the lecture early and I saw him sit alone. So, we just naturally caught up with stuff like what the plan would be after graduation (we are both year 4). Then, he randomly mentioned a book that I liked as well, and I mean, for the guy friends I know, they don't really read books like that. 

Since then, I enjoyed talking to him more and I realized he had a great smile. He made me laugh a lot, and we seemed to have the same interests. Sadly, the semester ended and we would possibly never see each other again. 

You know the feeling when you have a crush on someone and enjoy being with him but at the same time you are afraid he might just treat you as a friend, or when you are so curious to know about his love life but you never dare to ask?
And above all, it's a feeling when you are afraid that you might get hurt once more time.

I just wonder, how much the chance would be to see someone that makes your heart flutter again like that?

1252,"I have been holding this in for awhile. It’s up to you to believe the authenticity of this post. I know everyone has different perceptions of virginity. For me, I feel like my virginity has been robbed of me in clinical settings. When I had a bad tummy ache as a kid, my family doctor would conduct a rectal examination on me before prescription. I didn’t think much of it as a child. But it started to bother me when I grew older and had to visit the A&E or clinics to get my abdominal pain diagnosed. I always felt violated deep down but couldn’t mutter anything to anyone since it’s embarrassing and everyone just regarded it as a standard medical protocol to treat abdominal ache. As I ponder about this these days, it came to my realisation that prior to the conduct of the test, my permission was always not sought and the doctors always didn’t explain to me the rational clearly. I was somehow advised to bend over and do it. Maybe I was just too sick to think about it and wanted a treatment. It was so humiliating, as though my purity is stained. And you may say that I’m thinking too much. Years ago, when I had to undergo a medical check up for an employment role, I went through the examination again for unbeknownst reasons. Thinking back, I felt really foolish for giving in. 

As I researched on the topic recently, nowhere was it mentioned that the test is to be done to diagnose stomachache or food poisoning. It’s primarily used to screen prostate and belly cancer, or doesn’t it? Do the doctors conduct it because of protocols or pardon my insolence, out of personal fetish? There are quite a few articles that claim that the test is no longer necessary for such diagnosis, and it was used to humiliate homosexuals for committing same sex crimes. At the very least, the patients should be asked whether they want to do the test and doctors should not assume their consent. I won’t want to compare it to the grief resulted from real sexual abuse. But I don’t know why I feel that the humiliation still lingers even after my last encounter years ago. Maybe I’m an oversensitive coward. Thank you for hearing me out

1258,"hey there. I’ve been on exchange and the past few months have been refreshing. I’d like to share some thoughts

In NUS, I constantly felt stressed about not having enough friends, not having good enough grades, fussing over internships and job prospects and other people’s opinions... I was constantly preoccupied with school, projects and worries and it made me feel anxious to the extent that my work ethic dropped considerably due to a lack of motivation.

Now that I’m on exchange, the change of pace freed up space in my mind to think properly. I stay home or take walks, thinking about my own opinions rather than what others expect of me. It was scary to realise that I’ve been living my life as dictated by society for so long that I had no idea what I wanted, or even liked, anymore. 

It took awhile to let the thoughts sink in but you know what? You and I, we don’t need to get jealous and compare ourselves to others. Learn for the fun of it, grades can be an afterthought. Keep being amazed everyday about smtg that interests you. Keep in touch with those who matter and realise that social media is a facade. Do work that YOU find meaningful and is aligned with your purpose. 

Remember that hobby you ditched years ago because you thought it wasn’t practical? It’s not a waste of time. Life is to be enjoyed not endured, go and do the things you love, with the people you love. 

There was no real point to this post, but I hope those who felt the way I did could take a step back to re-evaluate your life, and yourself. Know that if you’re not happy, you can change it, now. Good luck, I hope you can lead the life that you find fulfilling :)

https://www.facebook.com/593485004/posts/10162405250665005?d=n&sfns=mo

I’m not the OP of the post above but I’m sharing it as I felt that she made a really good point about entitled behaviours in public. Singapore’s moral education is effective in the sense that the general public has the sense of filial piety towards older people, respect your elders and what not. 

Because of this, we learn to give way to old people and we tend to let them do whatever they want, like letting them get in front of the queue for the bus or give up seats for them whether or not they asked for it. I think this has fostered a sense of entitlement for the older/boomer generation that they are now part of the “upper class” of society. 

I think I speak for all of millennials when I say 99% of us has encountered at least one selfish older generation individual in our lifetime. Just a few weeks ago I got told off by an old lady for sitting on a non reserved seat on the train, funny thing is that she was already on a reserved seat herself & it was a relatively empty train with no one who needed the seat. Her reasoning was “young people are entitled and should not sit on the train”. 

Of course not all the older gen are like that. Sometimes when I do something as simple as holding the door for an auntie carrying her ntuc bags she would smile and say “thank you ah boy”. On the other occasion when I give up my seat for the old lady she made the tsk sound while trying to squeeze into the seat and quickly sat down without looking at me and played Pokémon Go on her phone. So I think this post above was a really good example of how selfish individuals look like and we should not give way to them just because of their age. Respect should be earned not given. 

This is solely my opinion, please don’t flame me with personal attacks and this is an Nus based forum so let’s be civilised in the discussions

When he first started chasing me, I was stunned and wary, thinking he’ll leave once he gets bored. However, he would persist until I finally gave in and went out with him. I started getting used to his good morning texts and our regular dates, and I started to enjoy his company and really started to like him.

However, things went downhill when my issues came into place. I asked why would he even like someone like me, I wondered if we were just friends and if I was a way to kill time, I tried to stick a label on a relationship that was still progressing organically, I grew suspicious that girls around him wanted him when they were probably just being friendly. In short, all my insecurities succeeded in driving away a guy who has been nothing but sweet to me.

I have stuck with her throughout the 4 months persistently and she says im stupid for doing so, since most people would cut and run.
But it has come to a point where it's tiring to do so. 
Im tired. 
Tired of fighting so hard for someone who doesnt fight as hard for me.

I think i'm selfish for thinking that way. She's going through depression and yet here I am expecting her to put in effort into the relationship. 
I didnt bring this issue of me feeling like I wasnt getting anything out of the RS up to her for a couple of months because i knew she was going through stuff and I didnt want to add on to her burden.

I did my research online and understand that it's normal for people undergoing depression to feel this way sometimes. But it's hard to hold on to a relationship when the other party insists on breaking it off. And even harder when the reason behind it is because she thinks she cant provide me with the things a girlfriend provides because she has depression.


Recently she asked me why i wasnt sharing stuff with her, because i'd want her to share her problems with me, so we could work through it together.
So I finally did. I brought up the issue of me feeling like I wasnt getting anything out of the RS gently, but also didnt tell her because i knew she was going through stuff and I didnt want to add on to her burden.

And she broke down. Went back into this loop of wanting me to dump her. Either that or she would dump me.
I dont know why i'm still fighting so hard for her. Am i dumb to do so? 

I did insist on bringing her to see a counsellor recently after a recent severe suicidal episode.
All i want is for her to be happy again.
But a part of me is feeling really really tired at having to deal with all of this everytime. I tried so hard yet I feel i'm stuck at this same spot with her.
Should i let her go?

1266,"I was from one of those ‘elite’ schools. When I graduated, I wanted to go to a prestigious universities in the US/UK. Not only was I attracted by the prestige and bragging rights that come along with it, I also wanted to escape Singapore and my parents, and enjoy that party life that seems ubiquitous overseas and is barely existent in our local universities. However, I applied to all the top schools and no one accepted me. I came close to getting Cambridge (I got into the winter pool) but was given a rejection nonetheless. The only acceptance letter I had was from NUS. My pride would not allow it and I vowed to try again over my 2 years in NS. Some of my schoolmates are going to top schools overseas and I felt as though they will think I am a failure if I ended up in NUS. However during NS, when see other people from different backgrounds, I start to realise that NUS is actually a pretty good school and that people actually try rather hard to get into it; a vastly different perspective from that of dumping ground back in my school for people who can’t make it to oxbridge/ivy. My diminishing willpower from depression in camp, compounded with the consideration of my parent’s financial situation, made me decide not to try again and be content with NUS. Now, I am currently a Year 1 student here and whenever I see my friends partying in the halls of cambridge/ harvard, something inside me would die a little. Personally, I feel that the party life is sorely lacking in here and all everyone does is mug. But one thing I realise is, party life aside, that it is not just about which university you are in, but whether u can excel in it. As long as I can excel in NUS, it doesn't matter that I am not a harvard boy does it?

Although there were many ups and downs in our relationship and there were times where i almost broke up with him, but he never once allowed it to happen. We would always resolve our arguments and conflicts no matter how long it took. He's the best bf i can ever ask for. Although there were some broken promises along the way, one promise he never broke was leaving me. 

Many a times, couples think that they are enemies fighting each other in a war. But they fail to see that they are actually on the same team. Many fights between us are usually menial, useless arguments that we only realise much later. If he were'nt so patient with me, im sure we would have have broken up.

We had something going on, sex and feelings. Both of us are feminine looking but things became really dramatic for us and then we decided to end on a random day. We mutually agreed upon that we still want to remain friends but do you think it is possible? We are still texting each other but only as friends. Because girls relationship boundaries are unclear, like how our girlfriends get jealous too when we made new friends but we know that it’s not love, just possessive friendship, so I’m quite confused with the relationship between us now, like what are we? 

Whenever Im with her, I still feel that I wanted to be close and sometimes still have fantasies over her to touch and kiss her. But of course I didn’t allow any of my urges to act upon themselves. Should I stop disturbing her life now since she’s got a loving bf and quietly just leave and get my own bf too?

So since orientation period, one of my close friends (lets call her K) eye candied this guy, lets call him R. K and R soon became very close. Through K and a few other friends, R met me. R knew about me for a long time as I am very active on campus. Recently, R keeps replying to my instagram stories even when it is just a quote. R is also close friends with my close guy friend and thus R acts like he knows me well and calls my name every time he sees me. Once, he even called my name infront of K without acknowledging her. K was surprised because she did not know that he and i are that close (we are not).

As a close friend, i know that i should never fall for someone she has interest in. However, R has been too extreme recently and i keep trying to blow him off. To make matters worse, R began seeing another girl but he still does all that to me, and even looks at me openly infront of his “girl”. R’s friends even confirmed that R has a crush on me and is only dating that girl for fun and the girl is clueless. R even gave me roses for my birthday! One of R’s close girl friends even began to spread rumours about me trying to be a third party in R’s relationship and that i am overrated in school.

I wish all these rumours would stop because 
1. my close friend is already very upset about R dating someone else, and then finding out he likes me..
2. I like this guy a lot but these rumours are jeopardising my chances with him. 

I am not sure how to tell R to stop without coming off as mean and arrogant, and ruining his relationship with his current girl.

Recently, i scrolled through his dms (we have access to each other’s acc since forever), and i found out that that girl friend of his sent him a post of a girl covered in hickies. He then replied “just saw, wtf insane sia”

Not sure if this is already a red light in the relationship? She sends him girls who show cleavage and ass as well(she shows a lot of cleavage).. when confronted, he denies and says that they’re only friends. The horny sending of posts continues till today. They also send each other explicit sex position stickers on telegram.. To make matters worse, 5 months ago, I decided to stop having sex with him because i wanted our relationship to be build on passion before anything sexual. He talks about her all the time like how he’s worried for her studies and how she spends a lot of time clubbing and going on dating apps. But when i do badly for a test, he doesn’t even express concern.

Is this because we are already too comfortable with each other? I trust him but i think sending explicit post on instagram to his girl friend is ridiculous. He also does not see the logic behind where I’m coming from. Not sure if it is because he needed to satisfy his sexual needs that I no longer provide?

Since we see each other pretty often (due to work), my feelings towards him have been growing stronger these days. We text each other almost every day, about random thoughts and events. Most of the time he does not reply to my messages immediately maybe because he is busy with work. But whenever he gets a chance, he'd reply to every single message I've left with really long 'essays'. And it has always been me who texts him first. He is genuine, empathetic, sensitive and caring. He's generally shy and sometimes I feel this awkwardness between us. I wondered if he likes me or at least has some feelings about me too. So I sent some signals such as really light flirt messages and giving him gifts. But he didn't reciprocate to any of those. Eventually, I asked him for a movie. I could see that he put in some effort into dressing up and getting hair done. And he did look cute that day. Anyway, we just watched a movie. Nothing happened. After the movie, we walked along and chatted a bit on the way to the bus stop. And we went home separately. I really enjoy talking with him despite occasional awkward silence between us. And he doesn't seem to dislike me. Sometimes I feel frustrated because he took like one day to reply to me. And I was telling myself okay I'll cool down a bit and try to put everything behind. Then soon after I see him again, the desire of getting closer to him and more connections with him is back again. This has been really torturing for me. Due to the nature of work, we still have to see each other like 3-5 times a week. I'd like to seek for some advice here.  I really like him. What should I do? I'm not sure if he likes me? After so many tries on my side and no response from him, maybe I should take it as a no? Or should I be honest with him? But tbh, I have not thought about the realistic future between us such as age difference, different education background, family, and maybe income etc.?

I have laid down the route on my career progression and will be just sticking to this. Any girls were to marry me, can be called lucky lol ????

1282,"Hi everyone, OP of #72358 here. I've read all of your comments on my original post and am really grateful for the support from this community. Long read ahead.

Just recently things got worse again. Short backstory is that we will be attending a semi formal gathering with many others with banquet dinner and some senior staff involved with performances as well. The dress code is not stated clearly but hearing from other friends who will be attending, many are not wearing formal suits and just wearing button up shirts and formal pants.

As someone who does not like to dress up so nicely as my mentality was that fashion was never a major concern for me growing up, I felt that wearing a collared button up shirt and formal pants was sufficient enough. However, my girlfriend felt otherwise.

She has known that i am really not the type to dress up, all be it that i do dress up nicely when during the appropriate times such as going to a nice restaurant for our anniversary or to a wedding dinner. My schedule had finally cleared up for me to have more free time in the past week and she began asking me what i would wear to the event. She initially suggested for me to wear a suit and a bowtie to match colours with her dress to be cute couple matching kind of thing. I told her as kindly possible that i preferred to wear my original outfit as money is tight for me now while looking for a part time job, but would be open to match colours if i could find the same shirt with the same colour as her dress.

I believe that i was firm with my decision the first time she asked me about it, but i was asked several more times in the past few days about taking on her offer about wearing a bowtie or get a blazer. After telling her that her pestering was getting slightly repetitive since i had told her the same response each time she asked, she took offense to my response and got upset at me quite badly. She ended up sending me a whole string of messages (about 10-15?) but shortly deleted them afterwards and ghosted me until the afternoon of the next day (this took place around night time).

This wasn't the first time this had happened. I couldn't catch all that she wrote as i was away from my phone but caught slight glimpses of what she wrote in some messages. Some of them included ""goodnight this is what we've become i guess"" and ""Sometimes i dont get why its so difficult for you to do (this and that)"". I could get the vibe that she said all of that in the moment, but she had told me previously that when she's drunk or angry her filter goes off and she really tells the truth. Its happened before but this time felt worse than all the others.

The whole commotion ended with me agreeing to her request and got a blazer that matched her dress colour, which further worsened my financial situation now which she knows isn’t doing that good and i could do with saving cash and not spending it on certain unnecessary items. I crumbled under her pressure and gave in.

Side tracking for a bit, a family friend of mine recently passed away by suicide and i told my gf about it and how my family has been affected especially my mum who has teared up at random times just thinking of what happened. I've told her to really stop with the suicide threats and saying about suicide so openly as i believe those who truly feel suicidal tend to not show signs of it, yet she has still continued with the recent meltdown leading up the deleted messages part.

Back to the main topic, I feel that our relationship has been over for a while, but neither of us has taken the step forward to end it properly. From my perspective, it feels as if she would be better off as a person without me. She had previously told me that she would not leave me because she believed that people usually find their soul mate, and she could not understand how people could date more than one person after breaking up with their previous partner/s.

I have suggested taking a break from each other for us to grow and mature, to learn from our mistakes and become better persons for each other. She shot the idea down and said that it was either we were with each other or not at all. I think it is time for me to take the first step for what needs to be done for the better of her and the both of us.

And if you are reading this L, I’m sorry for our lows but thankful for sharing the moments we had with each other, you’ve taught me how to love someone other than my family more than i could ever have. I love you, but it is time for us to be apart and mature for the better of each other and our future partners.

1285,"Hi, after reading many of the responses to #72599, i find that some responses are rather unfair. For example, Exhibit A says ""If he doesn't want to sleep in the same room as him means he doesn't want to spend time with you after a long day"", or Exhibit B says ""Has his own room means he can bring company over *wink face*""

Personally i feel that having your own room separate from your partner's is completely fine, especially if its a mutual agreement between both parties. As an introvert myself, i find social gatherings and interacting with many people during my day can be really exhausting and at the end of the day i may want to just be by myself with no noise, no distraction and just time for myself to recharge and regain the energy.

To add on, partners may have different work schedules or personal schedules. Let's say husband wakes up at 6am to go to work but the wife wakes up at 9am. Husband goes to sleep at 11pm but wife stays up later and only goes to bed at 1am. Such different timings can result in clashing of sleep schedules and may disturb the other party.

I saw a recent post on reddit with many people responding to why they and their spouse had chosen to sleep in separate bedrooms. If any of you are interested its here: https://tinyurl.com/y4dmva5x

All this being said, a relationship works both ways. To OP of #75299, talking to your partner and be open to the idea of sleeping in separate bedrooms. I'm sure the lack of time together at night will be surely made up when both you of are together at other times :)

1297,"TLDR: My best friend is a chronic latecomer and it's really frustrating. 

This is going to be pretty ranty but some advice would be nice too! My best friend (all the way from secondary school, through poly, NS and now uni) is consistently late. Not just 15-20 minutes late but 2-3 hours late. 

In our poly days, we'd study together at my place and he would agree to show up at 10 am but arrive at 2-3 pm because he  ""overslept"" or some equally inane reason. 

When I brought this up to him, he says I'm being unreasonable because no one else has ever given him grief for it. In NS, he was a stayout Pes E Clerk and was still consistently late for it but his superiors never said anything. When he was interning (at a very prestigious company, mind you), he was still late every day with no one saying anything. He’s late to every major social gathering too.  I seriously don’t understand how he has gotten away with it so far. His reasoning if that if his boss, enciks, parents and other friends have no problem with it, he doesn’t understand why I do.

He’s also late for major events - he missed my poly graduation, he was 2 hours late to his own award ceremony, he was also one of the last few to show up at my birthday party despite agreeing to come 2 hours earlier to help me decorate. The list goes on. I guess I’m feeling the pinch of it more now in Uni because we tend to meet outside or in school now and waiting around outside for two hours is infinitely worse than chilling at home for four. I’ve always told him that I hate this late-coming thing but I’ve only started getting more aggressive about it in the past year because I’m seriously super sick of it. Treating me like my time is worthless is one thing but how is that going to affect other people’s impression of him?

Again, when‌ I told him nicely that he needs to stop doing this because it’s rude and he needs to start valuing my time and that the whole world shouldn’t revolve around him, his response is that my time matters less because he’s in Computing and I’m in Arts (seriously?? I love being in Arts btw so that’s not even an insult) and started going into a personal attack, telling me that I’m having relationship problems with my other half because I’m “unreasonable” and “have communication issues”. That was really hurtful. I’ve been nothing but calm and compromising and even he admitted that “it was a personal attack to get you to shut up”!

I’ve been putting up with this for 5-6 years now and it’s really, really frustrating.  He tried to pass it off as “startup culture” at some point but I don’t buy it lol. I guess I’m posting this as a rant but for reals though, what should I‌ do? Is there anything I can even do?

Seriously super hurt right now.

1300,"I recently met this girl online, she looks damn cute and hot and upon chatting more she's also intellectual, smart and very caring towards her fam and friends. So basically i feel she's kinda like wife material but damn hot kind. After chatting for a few days i initiated texting exclusively and she agreed. In the next few days, we talked about what we do to our families to our career plans and ideal family life. Our convos were also punctuated with quite abit of sexual tension. We would often refer to each other as bb, baby or babe and often drop miss you or love you msgs. 

In a week's time i asked her out for our first date and she suggested that I pop by her place. Well I am completely open with fwb ish rs and is in fact extremely excited that she is the other party. A part of me was planning to start out as fwbs and get the girl eventually - cause hot wife material damn. We made plans to meet and we both expressed how much we cant wait to be in each other's arms. 

The following day, however, she just completely deleted our chat and when I tried checking up her handle again I think she blocked me. 

Can someone tell me whats going on here? I am honestly feeling abit hurt cause our convos were really good - like both meaningfully good and fwb ish good. But at the same time im familiar with how im supposed to feel with regards to fwb ish rs. What is she doing/feeling all these while also? And what does that last move mean?? Maybe she had some emergency/unforseen circumstance that led to this sudden cutoff?? Or was i too agressive/desperate in showing my keeness that i scared her off?? Did we progress too quickly??

He replied almost instantly and was shocked that I contacted him LOL. So to cut things short, since both of us felt the same way, we decided to go on a simple date on 2 days later to catch up. The date was fun and he made me feel so comfortable, totally different from what I expected it to be (thought it was gonna be awkward). He didn't change much, still that handsome, sweet ass boy, maybe only a little more mature (?) and I’m so grateful. So, I apologized, but he mentioned that it was partially due to his insecurity too, so I guess he isn’t blaming everything on me??? Anyways, 2 weeks have passed and just 2h ago, we’ve got into an official relationship again. Isit too fast but ya we promised that we ain't gonna be immature again.
So, I just wanted to thank all of you who’d encouraged me to follow my heart. That was all I needed, that little push to tell him how I feel. Oh ya and remember the girl in his insta story?

Even though we are good friends, I recently started noticing he has been becoming increasingly condescending towards Engineers and other non-math majors. What started off as a joke against Engineers in their inaccurate and way too practical approach to maths, slowly started to become toxic. 

Once I was helping my gf with engineering calculus and he walks in and starts complaining that what I’m teaching is too simplified and has nothing to do with real math. Like seriously? I get that he is learning more advanced mathematics but is it really necessary to have such an attitude to the extent of considering engineers’ math as being “nothing to do with real math”? And whenever I confront him about it, all he says is “sure buddy...”.

Now I’m starting to wonder if all mathematicians have this attitude towards non-math people.

1318,"Hi, I am evergreen and never had a girlfriend before. Before coming to NUS, I was from a predominantly male school so I have very few contact with girls. I have no female friends as well. Now, I am trying to find a girlfriend but I find the prospect of talking to a girl and hanging out one to one with her very stressful. I tried tinder before and went on a few tinder dates but I personally found those to be very very stressful. Before the date, I have to dress well (I usually wear T-shirt and shorts when I go out with my male friends), do my hair, put on contacts and shave. As such, when I go out with such attire, I feel very self conscious and not like myself. I feel like the whole world is staring at me and judging me, thinking why the hell is he dressed like that for? On the date itself, I would feel very stressed up trying to keep the conversation going and making sure I do not say anything that might potentially offend her or make her think I am a lowly creep. I tried getting a girlfriend in NUS but whenever I am in a one to one situation with my fellow female coursemate, I would feel very stressed up trying to keep the conversation going and making sure I don’t come across as weird and creepy. At times I would just feel like breaking down mentally and running away. Thus, I avoid asking them out even on casual lunches. Just asking them for lunch is stressful and I fear what they might think my intentions might be, which is why I procrastinate a lot before I actually do ask them out. I never had this problem with guys as I feel that they are less judgmental and more accepting of me. Compared to girls, I feel at ease around them and am able to say and do what I want freely without fear of social repercussions. Thus, til now, I never had a female friend, much less a girlfriend. But sometimes when I see pretty girls around campus, I really wish I had a girlfriend, although the prospect of dating seems very daunting. Even my coursework feels 1000x easier compared to this. What should I do?

One day she messaged me and invited me to her landed property. I was into her so I took the risk even though I was afraid she was trying to get revenge on my friend. We became fwbs and enjoyed every moment of it together in secrecy from my friend. After a year of enjoyment, I decided to call it off out of respect for my friendship and to lower the chances of this secret ever getting out (there was no evidence of it).

To this day my friend occasionally rants about his ex from several years ago... and I have to awkwardly nod my head and change the topic as I am reminded of how hot she was in bed.

1324,"Please beware when someone tries to get too involved in your life. 
They may want to spend time with you so often that in turn you will have to let them know what you are doing when you are not free, which threatens your personal time.
Even worse, they may urge you to introduce them to your other groups of friends. This allows them to include themselves in your other friends plans, and further invades your space from that person.

This happened to me and that person became involved with my other friends which complicated things when I needed to cut ties with that person.

This is why I keep my closest friendships private and find instagram toxic for letting people know who you hang out with and what you do with your time. Many people would think I have few friends but that’s false and nobody would realize who my real best friend is, to protect them and myself.

1329,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years. We are going to go overseas together soon for the first time during my birthday. Is it wrong to want him to pay for me for the trip? We don't usually each other any presents for birthdays/festive seasons and I have only gotten a rose from him on the first valentines day once. Most of the time, I will pay for our meals together. I have been using my savings to pay for the both of us but luckily I am currently working part time now so I am still able to survive. He is a scholar and has a good allowance every month so he dosent have to worry about cash. He thinks that spending money on good food is a waste of money but he would spend a lot more on his hobbies / buying new gadgets. So most of the time, I end up paying for all our dates and can only afford something nice once a year. When I suggested to go on dates more often like once every 2 months, he would complain and say that it is expensive and when his friends invites him to eat at Bistro, he would be more than willing to go. He says it's because he seldom eat with his friends. And when he decides to treat me to something nice, I feel very restricted because he will tend to order so little I am barely full from eating. Although he does give me a bit of cash every few months, it is not enough to cover the expense we spend together everytime. I feel like an ATM to him because he always dosent being his wallet when he goes out with me so I end up paying for everything. Even when I eat with his parents, I have to pay for his drinks. When he eats with my family, we never let the guest pay for anything. 
TLDR I just want to feel pampered by my boyfriend once in a while :( is it just me being a princess? Am I asking too much?

I'm also starting to think that I may have deeper feelings for someone that I was pursuing prior to this current relationship ...

One of the reasons why I got into this relationship is that the girl whom I was pursuing did not express any interest in developing into an official relationship.

1333,"To post 72534: Your hell is nothing compared to us engineering students. Its like a tight slap to our faces honestly. You only have 1 module that takes alot of time and you have ONE rest day, that is more than enough my friend. 18 MCS is so little and it’s the minimum MCs required for each semester based on NUS rules. For us, we have multiple modules that are definitely tougher than yours.E.g  Engineering Calculus, CS1010E etc. I am taking 22 MCs by the way which is more than youts, no choice or I will have to overload for the subsequent semesters.

Sure, FASS has its own diffculties like readings, but we had it tougher than yall definitely. We also have a number of projects and assignments to clear and some can take DAYS to clear, making us have very little time for revision for finals. I have already burned all my weekends (no rest days) for the past few weeks due to that. I have seen people in your course having alot of time to go outing at night for drinking ,mah-jong sessions etc. My engineering friends and I on the other hand, have to sacrificed these and mug instead.

Btw, you already know CS1010E is hell based on the recent CS1010E confessions. It’s even worse to those who do not have much background. I think you will definitely have depression if you experience the hell of it. I dare say FASS modules are easier than engineering modules. Don’t believe? Go and ask around anyone who took both engineering and FASS majors. So please, stop complaining. Thank you.

1. Will your boyfriend dance for you for one hour just because you made him breakfast? Will he strum the guitar  while gazing into ur eyes, while singing a love lullaby, just because you helped clean the windows? 

2. Will your boyfriend say “love you” or “saranghaeyo” (the Korean version) daily? 

3. Mosst importantly, your boyfriend may ignore you. He may push you away. He may break up with you, block you on social media, block your calls, and even say to your face “I’m sick and tired of you. We’re broken up, please don’t harass me any more” while maintaining an icy cold glare. 

4. Will a male idol even bother picking fights? Will an idol quarrel with you? Will an idol block you on social media? Will he push you away, accusing you of being “too clingy and irritating” when you fly with him from  airport to airport, from concert to concert? 

5. No, an idol will never reject u or push you away from him. Unlike boyfriends who may get tired if you, an idol will only look at you with sweet puppy eyes and say “I love you”, and croon the sweetest sounding love ballads into your ears (if you have his song in ur phone, u can feel love any time u want!) 

6. And what did I do for my idol in exchange for all the affection? Why, I helped him clean his windows? I helped him wash dishes? No, all I did was to become his fan. 

7. Yeah, all these is fake. Then dating a real boyfriend is real? You sure? Look at the “real” boyfriends pretending to say “I love you forever and ever!” They don’t mean what they say obviously, see how many cheat! See how many abuse their wives and beat them! See how many subject their girlfriends to gaslighting, manipulation, and physical violence! 

8. On the other hand, chasing an idol never subjects you to gaslighting, physical violence, and cheating. Idols are always there for you, whether or not you bother to help them cook, clean and tidy the house.

People seem to have no problem when their friends stay in contact with ex classmates and ex hall mates, but they seem to get jealous instantly when their boyfriend/girlfriend stay in contact with ex lovers? 

So it means if I have a new professor in NUS, I cannot stay in touch with my previous form teacher in jc? Because now I have a new teacher and I must “move on” from jc? I am supposed to have a “clean break” from everyone who taught me in school just because I got a new professor? 

So If I make new friends in year two, I must “move on” from old friendships forged in year one? 

Did anyone say,you’re in NUS already, u should “move on” from poly and jc!! No. 
But people say, you should “move on” from past relationships, why? 

How does staying friends with people from my past (primary school friend /old neighbour /secondary school  friend) prevent me from being a good friend to other  university pals?  Do  I  have to cut ties  with former friends?!

If nobody says we should cut ties with former classmates after graduation, nobody says we should we cut ties with former teachers when we leave, why do so many people think the other way for ex lovers? Not ex Teachers, not ex colleagues, not ex classmates, but so specifically ex lovers? 

I’m okay if my boyfriend stays in touch with his ex gf, just like how I’m happy when my Uni pals remain in touch with secondary school friends. What’s wrong?

So let's say we have 4 components to the project - after finishing our respective components, M would just quietly make modifications to our components without letting us know or explaining why he's making the modification(s) as he deems. Only when confronted would he explain his rationale for his thought process, but despite arguing that i'm also correct, he would insist that he is correct and im wrong and honestly at that stage i simply choose to give up arguing with him because it's very mentally draining and i just accept his argument.

Not only that but when it comes to presentation, he would also want to control the way that we speak, the choice of words we use despite things being an informal presentation. While i can understand where he is coming from in his actions and i commend his level of effort that he is putting in, i personally feel that it becomes very mentally exhausting when I'm being microed and controlled so hard. 

I'm honestly not saying M is at fault or anything here, in fact i really respect his level of effort that was put into the project but i think somewhere along that level of effort some other things get lost. Is the journey of getting grades and marks so important that the fun of learning gets sacrificed along the way? i mean i personally enjoyed working on my own component and being in charge of it but when i get microed so hard by my groupmate it honestly becomes a very draining process. i just don't know what to feel, like does anyone else feel this way or has anyone ever encountered such situations before?

The biggest thing is that even after I cheated (sort of) and that went horribly wrong, he still took care of me, brought me to the doctor and all - no judgement. And then a week later, I broke up with him over something completely irrelevant and trivial because I'm a dumbass. 

I know, I know, I'm extremely stupid for letting something this great go. I guess my question is: how should I make it up to him? Even showing up at his place to grovel for his forgiveness doesn't feel enough. What do men want? Chocolate? Flowers?? Clothes?? Video games????

1365,"Why value honesty when nobody gives a single f*ck about your honesty? It's not as if me saying ""oh my English is pretty bad"" would make anyone stop to read this confession with more earnest, more vigor to try to understand the confession.
Honesty can't get you anywhere only being taken advantage of more easily. My friend could have told his gf on the phone ""oh I'm gonna hang up cos i wanna play my game"" what would the gf have done? Join in? What if the game is single player? Stop him? 
How about ""oh I'm sorry i forgot to do my part in the project"" what would the team members have said? Toxic members would be ""what the f*ck gave u one job and you can't do it right"" or some members that would simply be pissed would think, or tell others how useless his/her teammate is. 
Why be honest here when all it does is to make others see how selfish or how useless you are when probably all you wanted was a me time or that you are helpless with memorising even with various methods of reminders?
Others that would've known your intentions in doing something would convince you with their own reasoning to stop you from doing that ""something"" also somehow guilt tripping you which is why i said being honest makes you vulnerable to being taken advantage of. 
Cooking up valid reasons to lie gives you the upperhand to take advantage of other people's sympathy causing others to think they understand what you've been through and give you another chance, to
Who would offer another chance when you didn't have a valid reason yet you are honest with them? Others would probably feel that honesty should be part of the ""good"" side where you should be apologetic, learning from your mistakes and not desiring for things like a second chance.
My thoughts about this is everywhere and it is merely an idea that is not proven to be true. To those who actually read this you could probably have a good argument that others or I would not have thought of and I'd like to hear them. 
Oh wow is this me being honest about my opinion that you could take advantage of me to tell me I'm wrong? Hmmm....

1366,"Hi there! Freelancing advice needed. 
I graduated with a degree from NUS because getting a degree is what I did want to achieve. However, I am pretty skilled in design work (which has nothing much to do with my FASS degree) and decided to continue working in this area freelance. (I have been doing freelance designing while studying anyways and I have established a decent portfolio.)
I graduated last year and has been doing freelance designing work for about 1 year, full time. I am planning to continue with this “career lifestyle” in the long run. I go on a short term contract basis or project base work and I get a decent average pay of 3k plus/minus monthly. 
Many have advised me to “look for a job” so that I can “gain exposure” etc. I get where they are coming from, but I am really satisfied with my status quo, and, I believe that, with my portfolio, if I were to want to switch to a full-time job, it is still possible.
Does anyone out there have any freelancing experience or advice to share whether this is feasible in the long run? Am I too simple-minded to think this way?

1367,"My girlfriend and I have been together more than 3 years and we got to the stage when we are discussing future plans. A few months ago, we started having sex but the more we do it, the more we realize we are sexually incompatible. We have tried ways to fix it but there is no improvement. I think it is going to take too much work to close the gap. As I often feel unsatisfied after the sex, I did it less and less. Can I use sexual incompatibility as a reason to break up with her?

1369,"In response to OP #72365

I quite agree with you. However, the issue for me isn’t whether the commenters are NUS students or not, but it’s about the type of comments left on each confession. Granted, some of the confession appears to be troll posts, but even then, does it really entail the need for the public – anybody, really – to leave such negative and distasteful replies?

From my observation, the ugliest comments are often written by those who have morally disengaged, and thus rationalised their hurtful and malicious comments as words of wisdom or blunt advice, from the “necessary evil” standpoint. Yet, their behaviour is in fact more self-serving and overly self-righteous. My best guess is that they probably derive satisfaction from the thought of posting an ‘educated’ response, made worse by the thought of it being watched by bajillions of people on the internet.

Anyway, to cut to the chase, when it comes to malicious comments to confessions that are more serious and sensitive in nature (e.g. those concerning mental health), I’ve sent out emails to the respective organisations that the commenters belong to, be it commercial companies or educational institutes. And that’s probably why you see some commenters disappearing from the forum. *winks*

Last but not least, the “top fan” badge doesn’t value-add to the quality of your comment/advice. It only means that you’ve been surfing the NUSWhispers page for far too long. But what you can really do as a true top fan is to keep others in check, and prevent them from attacking or bullying others with hurtful replies. :)

Thanks for reading! 
Peace out.

P.S.: Before I forget, if you wish to learn more about moral disengagement and organisational misbehaviours, you may like to bid for MNO3313J next semester! It’s a tough module, but the Prof’s delivery is excellent.

1371,"Hi prof Ben/everyone, 

I need some serious advice/perspective to help me with this emotional issue of mine that has been bugging me for years.
My relationship with my parents, my mom especially, is estranged. 
And I would like to have some opinions on how I feel, and hopefully improve things (?).

Ever since young I’ve always felt like no matter what I did and how much effort I put into something, I’m never and never will be enough for them.
To my mom, I’m a loser, I can’t study well, I can’t make money to support myself properly Nor even give her monthly income (as oppose to what she did for my grandma when’s she’s my age - 24).

I wouldn’t say I hate them but I feel so gutted and angered that they were never really there for me, Nor support my goals as their child. To them I’m just a retirement plan in the future, but right now, a free loader living in their space, drinking their water and “taking money” off of them (which comes close to almost zero, less electricity bills?).
They say I’m not contributing to the family and I’m always closed off to myself and selfish.. but I’m truly just emotionally drained.

They were never there for graduations, army POP etc and other larger life events. No birthdays, no celebrations Nor verbal affirmations or even just a simple “I’m proud of you”. All along it’s only harsh remarks about how selfish I am, about how I’m a bad Son and I wouldn’t amount to anything.

I’ve been working since sec sch for pocket money, I paid for my poly fees, and now uni fees and all of my living expenses. Not gonna lie, it’s so so tough to manage a full time job and doing part time classes at night on top of chores at home. I’ve not been doing well for school, and full time job has taken a toll on my studies, I’ve delayed 2 semesters now.. on top of that, I worked for a year after NS to save up $. (I feel like I’m losing out so much to my peers who seems to be doing so well. My female friends have already graduated and the guys, soon to graduate and yet I’m stuck neither here Nor there.)

I feel so anguished - physically and emotionally. I feel like quitting life.

I just wished that they’d see that their Son is working hard and not a lazy bum. At the same time, I need some trust and investment from them to make life a little easier. 
They’re really traditional parents that sees the only way for success is having a degree first and working in the STEM industry. None of those are my passion Nor what I’m good at. 
It’s so hard to fight back and be successful, I wish I have more time and energy to go for more courses and defeat the rat race too. (But it’s so difficult to change the course of my life at this point in time, I need resources that I don’t have.) 

Guys, am I right to be angry at them? I don’t even want to be angry at them.. but I’m so exhausted and tired of these set of cards that’s thrown at me. 

If there’s any advice or opinions on what should I do to better support myself and change my circumstances, please let me know and I’ll do anything.

I look forward to your perspectives. 
Please help me,

Exhausted Son.

1372,"hi honestly does anyone know how to send a feedback to the university regarding a particular tutor? this female TA under the 1k BT mod is seriously useless. she tutors majority of the students, but never have i heard a single student benefiting from her class. she spends 40 mins reading off slides on lecture content that has already been taught, and then the remaining 20 mins reading the tutorial question without providing any solutions to any of the questions. when asked questions during or after the class, she stutters and beats about the bush and does not answer with a definite answer. once i questioned her and she just told me to ""take the answer as it is. i dont know, try the code yourself and see if there is any error message or not"". there is practical exam tomorrow and as im trying to get some answers from her tutorial slides, im just disappointed again that her slides are filled with just the tutorial questions only.  it really is very unacceptable of a TA and i can't believe she tutors most of the tutorial classes and none of her students have voiced this out yet. even the other year 2 undergrad TA is much better than this phd student. if you're one of her student and feels the same way - please escalate this together.

1376,"I refer to the many articles with regard to the  hoo-ha about PMDs and their related accidents. Statistics and numbers should always be looked at from a neutral point of view, do consider also how the numbers are derived, and whether the way they are presented could possibly sway the readers to think a certain way.

We also have to understand why PMDs were introduced in the first place, and why the regulations were created, and also what kind of future planning our gov has envisioned for us. Policies, regulations and authority requirements usually follow these ‘masterplans’.

From what I can have observed/read/experienced/heard/studied since PMDs were introduced and (attempted to be) regulated, I can conclude that (as of now) we are not ready as a society for these devices.

I support the responsible usage of PMDs because I believe they play a role in achieving the nation’s car-lite dream. I prefer bicycles but considering our climate and space constraints, I won’t cycle to work knowing I’ll perspire like siao in my office wear. 

While everyone is entitled to their own views on this matter, I always try my best to listen and have conversations as to why they are so persistently against the usage PMDs, unlike some that judge immediately after hearing that I support their usage.

I also believe that no matter what kind of vision the G has, the citizens ultimately play the largest role in materializing that dream. We could have the supporting infrastructure in place, the widest footpaths, a dedicated cycling lane, bicycle/PMD/car sharing services... etc, but if we continue to be irresponsible, self-entitled users, we have to accept that we will be stagnant in this aspect, always discontented and dissatisfied. Blanket decisions like banning only postpones the problem until we choose to address the root of the problem. 

This isn’t my ideal Singapore, and Gandhi told me to be the change I want to see in this world. Therefore as a pedestrian, I give way to the PMD users on pedestrian footpaths. As a PMD user on the PCN, I give ample clear distance to fellow users and commuters before picking up speed. I educate my friends about the big picture of a car lite society. I still dream of a day where Singapore and Singaporeans will progress to that level of graciousness and courtesy. It may never happen, but I’ll play my part to achieve it.

TLDR: Understand the big picture before making  judgements. Singapore is not ready for PMDs or any forms of active mobility devices regardless of any improvements in infrastructure until the society learns to be responsible and less self-entitled.

1380,"I recently got into a heated argument with my best friend, and he has stopped talking to me. The relationship dynamics here - he's a popular guy, lots of friends. I'm an introvert, takes time for me to open up, but I opened up to him, and it has been difficult to let go of him ever since.

The more I got to know him, the more I saw his bad habits. He has this mentality that 'it's my life, and no one can tell me what to do'. So he always has his own ways of doing things. But all actions have consequences, and bad actions have bad consequences, which I have been a victim of, countless times.

For quite long I have kept quiet - I thought maybe this is what being a good friend is all about. But then I realised this can't go on forever, so recently I tried to hold him accountable for his destructive actions. But he always has creative ways to avoid accountability. When pushed further, he then claims the victim mentality, saying that I'm way too intrusive, makes me feel like I always want to pick a fight with him.

I could come up with a list of actions which satisfy him while consequentially hurting the people around him, following which he then invalidates their hurt despite making it explicit to him. And then playing victim when this pursuit of accountability for his actions turns ugly. But there are too many to list, and too painful to do so.

But you have to understand that it is so difficult to let him go because he is my only best friend. There's this void in my life now that he stopped talking to me. I'm not sure how he feels about me though, but from the outside, he doesn't seem to be affected at all. Which makes me feel so foolish.

I just want him to know that I'm sorry for forcefully tearing your walls down. Maybe you are not ready to engage in a mature conversation about your actions. But you know what, I will not attempt to tear down your walls down anymore. It is up to you to do it yourself, and I will patiently wait for you to come find me for that long overdue conversation. Because I still believe in this friendship.

1381,"Im #72376 OP. Thanks to those who gave positive comments.

To the few negative comment. You are the very reason why I want to rant in the very first place.

I really want to be like everyone here to be accepted. To be a filial daughter and not having ppl calling me lack of gratitude etc. 

But its really hard??? Just because your parents does not read you books or bring you for outing doesnt invalidate my unhappiness that my parents does not do that.

I asked my mother to read me books. I even went to library with my elder sibling to borrow. I brought it home and she shrug me off saying she is lazy.

I see my friends going for outing. I went back home and ask her to bring me but she say she hate going to such places cause got alot ppl. I then found out later she just didnt want to waste the money on me.

Living costs were paid for by my dad. My dad is not a good a husband, but other than not being emotionally available he is a good enough dad, he helps me out with errands without complain. He is not rich nor perfect but good enough that i do not have any such negative feelings for him to rant.

But my mother, when i forgot something and ask for her help like take transcript. She starts complaining to her friends and my teachers what a burden I was. 

When I get award in school and could ask one parents to join, my dad say he has work but my mother will ask if attendance is compulsory cause 'it is a waste of her time'.

When I was sick and needed to go hospital. She start telling me how cumbersome and burden it was.

When she finally got a divorce and has to move to a smaller flat. She told me how much money she has to spent on me every single day until i move out to my dad's.

This may sound unreal but before my parents were officially divorce, my dad had alrdy move out. But i woke up one day with my mother and her 'friend' lying beside me covered in blankets. I was young and will wake up in middle of night myself or i'll wet my bed and i saw clothes all over the floor. I was traumatised very deeply cause i did not understand why the adults were naked beside me.

But now i understood. I felt disgusted i felt horrible. I felt cheated. How can my own mother do this to me.

For years, i felt really bad that i am unable to be filial to my mother. Everytime we met, we will quarrel. I really thought i will be more appreciative after i give birth to my child. I really tot I should be grateful to my mother to at least be pregnant and gave birth to me. But I don't and I can't. 

Honestly, this is tmi. And at the end of the day, no matter how much I rant. No matter what my reasons is. I will forever be marked as the unfilial daughter who has no gratitude. 

For those interested in my daughter, i definitely will not make such mistake. For one i did not hire a maid because I chose to give her life, it is my very duty no matter how tiring work is to take care of her myself and wake up in the middle of night myself to take care of her needs. Ergo thanks to my partner who help with the housework. (I find it a point to mention my husband otherwise one or two comment will start asking about him just like they have asked about my dad)

Just because work is tiring doesn't invalidate your parent duty tbh. Because u could have choose not to give birth. Its understandable for parents to take a rest day or two but leaving ur child with maid every single day? Let your maid bath, cook, feed and put your child to bed every single day? Then please read both my posts again before you want to create life. For all you know, you might give birth to another child known as ingratitude by society.

Im anonymous. I share here and I can get some understanding. But in real life, I cant share my dirty laundry in public. I will just be known as ingratitude. I seek consolation with my partner and 1 or 2 close friends. But other than that, i repeat, Im known as ingratitude amongst the public.

I have immediate relatives whom I visit weekly. It is getting annoying recently. A few examples here. 

Examples 1: A convo with an elderly relative 
Context: I broke up with my ex (ITE background, doing general job) a few months back and recently got together with my current boyfriend (uni grad, civil service job). FYI: He has never met both of them but probably only heard stuff from members of my family. 
Female Relative: (Upon knowing that I have broken up with ex) Good. It’s good you broke up with him. He is not good for you. 
Me: (In my mind) Erm…seriously? How can you judge a person 
Me: (IRL) just look at him blankly, but didn’t give a reply. 
Out of “respect” just because he is elder, and base on my experience in knowing that he will obviously be stubborn in her own stance, I just cannot be bothered explaining to him, because it will probably just lead to a futile “argument” which ends of with me the younger one being labelled as “disrespectful” etc. My respect for him totally just dropped to ground zero. 

Example 2: Cousin of mine
Context: So, my bf works in a pretty high end role, well paid.
Cousin: So, you believe what he says? What if he is lying to you? 
Me: (In my mind) Seriously, that is so little faith you have in me? To me, that is very insulting. 
Me: (IRL) Yes, I have seen his staff pass and met his colleagues. Why would he lie about such things? 
Again, this type of people makes me want to role my eyes. 

However, unfortunately, due to family gatherings and stuff, I can’t just blatantly say I hate these people and avoid them. Now, I just chose to keep quiet and not say anything whenever I meet these people because they really have low sense in their judgements of people. I wouldn’t want to share something and them cause them to hold my words for it or use it against me. 
Shouldn’t they get to know a person properly before passing judgements? Why do people behave like this? What should I do?
I secretly lose my respect for them, but I do not show my distaste out in public to avoid conflict. I just don’t chum up to them and keep my distance physically and keep convos with them to the minimum.

Speaking of which, she has always been hesitant about staying over at my rc. I mean I feel like we have been together for so long and I am ready to take it to the next stage. But she is a very good girl who only thinks about playing and studies, so we have never talked about the topic of sex before.

Sometimes I love being around people but sometimes I just love to be by myself too. It's been hard for me. Ever since we broke up, I fell deep into depression and my anxiety got even worse. I cannot forgive myself for what I have done to her. I'm just hoping that I can get one more chance in making things right. I still love her and I always will. 

I even tried to find another partner but it's just not the same. Like they won't understand and love me like she did. I'm still trying hard to cope with my depression and anxiety. I'm just trying to live everyday and pretend to be happy. I really miss her. But I know she's happy now and all I ever want is for her to be happy, forever and always.

1396,"Hi everyone, I’m contemplating divorce with my wife but I too love my wife a lot. This is something I’m extremely distraught about and I feel like I’m thinking too much about it. Some days I wish I could pay more attention to her but then there are so many things going on in life. Occasionally, I would find some interest around and one time I was almost fell for a trap. I would call him A. He always dresses up really pretty and loves the colour pink. At one time, I almost disregarded everything around me and went ahead, despite knowing he was born with Squidward's masterpiece. It was fortunate that my decades of experience pulled me out of that situation. However, after that incident, there is this emptiness within me but every girl I've met does not give me the same level of affection that I have experienced from my previous waif. It has come to a point where every 3 months, I find a new person I really like and I have become addicted to this. As a guy, it is natural to be attracted to one of the opposite gender. 

However, as a man, one must be firm and commit to a relationship that you have promised to. Even if polygamy is practised (which it isn’t), you must take your partner’s feelings into consideration. Ignore those hypocrites who tell you that you can have multiple waifus. Choose well and with conviction, then stand firm by it. Those hypocrites will be the ones who will have trouble sticking with a particular choice. There is only one ground rule in this game of life: as long as they are not blood-related, they are free to be dated.

What is even more disgusting is that the sweet was half melted, and then stuck solid on the table. Idk who did this, intentionally or not, but seriously you have to do  some self reflection man.

1400,"Hello! If you're reading this, I hope your day is going well. I am an exchange student from a country far away from Singapore where the culture is somewhat different. Currently, nearing the end of my exchange semester at NUS, I am reflecting on my experiences over here. My overall experience here in Singapore has been very positive. I had to chance of meeting many amazing people along the journey and toured lots of places in Southeast Asia. So it's safe to say I really don't have any regrets. 
One thing that caught my notice was that most local students are very shy when it comes to engaging in a conversation with me. My guess is maybe it could be the unfamiliarity with my accent? As a result, I spent most of my leisure time here hanging out with other exchangers. Don't get me wrong, I still had plenty of fun. But sometimes I do wish for an opportunity to sit down with a local student, drink a few beers, and engage in a deep conversation. Not sure about others, but I'm actually really interested in learning more about Singaporean culture from an insider's point of view. What are some tips to better interact with locals?

There's so much public scrutiny, some of which are not helpful or even toxic in nature. I feel that this platform has lost its original purpose to ""give students a voice and encourage cross-faculty discourse"". It seems like this page is now skewed towards gaining readership among the public. I really hope that the admin can make some changes to cater more to the NUS students. 

There are other confession pages for other students from other educational institutions to air their thoughts or even pages for members to air their grievances about their organisations/workplace.  Perhaps the non-NUS public can be better served with a ""SGwhispers"" rather than intruding in our supposedly safe environment. 

I question what has this page become? I think the admin need to re-evaluate their purpose of running this platform, especially when they had plastered their ""Admin Note"" of being in the ""limelight"" after being featured by Today.

Once in a while he will help me pack lunch if I was rushing for work. Recently some people have been telling me that he likes me, I was a bit happy but.. I don't know if I should let things go on. He also quite often drops by my cubicle and we have small chats, or we hangout in deprt events etc. I like that he is a nice person and filial to his family, and can tell that he treats me quite nicer than normal colleague

However, I don't like his clique.. he often hangs out with other young colleagues in the department who are quite a gossipy group, often bad-mouth about bosses, other colls etc.. There was once he wasn't around with the gang and they were actually saying him behind his back. As a junior I did not dare to say anything.. but I feel that they do not really treat him as a friend, maybe like a source of information? He is very friendly with everyone in the department, likes to ask about and share stories with people. Sometimes he also joins in the bad-mouthing, sometimes very quiet. I don't know if he is immature or just insecure.. but deep down I feel that he is a good guy.

Should I continue to let things get closer between us? Would I be able to treat his insecurity? Should I tell him how I feel about his group of 'friends' he hangs out in the office?

But now I just feel complete disinterest in what I'm studying and I feel very stupid for not understanding concepts that many of my peers do. It doesn't help that I come from an extremely competitive faculty where many students appear so passionate about what they do. I'm constantly stressed out by the environment and also others' (family & friends) expectations of me.
I'm demotivated to the point where I skip half my classes and put in minimal effort into assignments and projects, even forgoing assignments that have low weightage. I feel extremely guilty each time I catch myself doing something other than work, since I have a lot of content to catch up on for the upcoming exams, which is probably why I'm writing this.

It wasn’t easy coping with the loneliness and unfamiliar environment but luckily the seniors at my student residence were friendly and helpful. We attended many activities and toured around the continent together. Over this time, I gradually grew closer to this local senior and we started going on trips with just two of us only. In my emotionally needy moments, the senior was there for me while my boyfriend couldn’t due to the time difference. 

Things happened, and I just discovered I am pregnant. Abortion is definitely out of the question as I am uninsured and the abortion bill will be sky high, not to mention the general unavailability of abortion services here. But I also don’t want to go back to NUS preggers as my boyfriend will surely know that it’s not his. I also don’t want to kill my own child and part of me is genuinely curious how a mixed race child of mine is going to look like. Marrying the local senior isn’t an option because while he is fun to date and good between the sheets, he isn’t the stable kind of guy good for bringing up a family (unlike my boyfriend).

How now? Should I try to extend my exchange or take a leave of absence and give up the baby for adoption here?

I am unsure if nus staff actually see this page but I would like to humbly suggest a buffer time that covers one class and its possible associated traveling time, of maybe 2.5h.

Since the start of this year she began behaving differently. I showed care and concern when she was at her lows but she still said that she didn't feel like i cared about her. She made demeaning remarks about herself which hurt me as well, i told her to stop saying those things but she never did. She made suicide threats and often said things like ""i should just go hang myself or jump off a building"", when she knows that i know people who have been in that situation but worse and it affects me closely. She had never trusted me with any of my friends of the opposite gender even after i made it official to everyone that we were together and distanced myself from other girls, even up to now. She didn't even trust her good friend from the same church to not try anything with me.

She started saying that i don't care for her at all, that no one gets her and that she is just a lonely person. I've been ready at my phone to listen to her and give her advice from her rants and be there for her, on some nights when she returns home late i ask that she send me a text to let me know that she's reached home safely. She still thinks i don't care for her. When i try to give advice i usually use my logic and common sense to give the best advice i can, yet it always seems to end up with her saying that i don't understand her at all.

Recently she also started talking about marriage, i told her that we should focus on our studies for now and think about it only when we are at a suitable age and can be financially independent. I was bombarded with questions of my commitment to her and whether i truly loved her.

I have a guy friend and we often go out to dinner together as friends. But everytime it comes time to pay, he doesn't allow me to pay even though I insisted on paying half. When I said I would pay for the next meal, he says no. His reasoning is that he earns more than me, therefore he should foot the bill while I should save for a rainy day. I really don't want to be a freeloader but he doesn't allow me to pay and I feel so guilty because we are just friends and I don't want to freeload off him. I have tried reasoning with him but he just shuts me down and to me it seems like he's offended? But I could be wrong. 

Today something strange happened. We were shopping around and we passed by a shop and I saw a really adorable Winnie the pooh stuff toy and I just causally commented how cute it was. He went in and grabbed 3 types of Pooh and asked me to choose 1 or he's going to buy all 3. I was a little taken aback and I told him he didn't need to buy me anything. But he kept insisting he was going to buy all 3 so I had to try my hardest to convince him I didn't want any. He put them back thankfully and we left. 

I guess now I have to be careful about what I say. I really had no intention of getting the Pooh. It was just a random comment. What's next? If I say a tshirt is nice, he's going to buy also? Or force me to choose? How do I stop this behaviour? Why has my friend changed? What should I do?

I do not wish them well. She has yet to tell my father. 

I am worried she will try to take his assets during the divorce. I plan to tell my father. Hopefully, we can think of a way to prevent her from getting a single cent.

1434,"I have been together with my boyfriend for 6 years. We were very close, we studied together , been to student exchange together, encouraged and help each other in our studies and transition into adulting. We created too much beautiful memories for the past 6 years. 

We are actually very different innately. We have differing viewpoints and personalities. He doesn’t like to express while I feel that communication is essential to build trust and bond. As a result, due to communication breakdown, we fought a lot. A lot more lately especially we started to run a hectic schedule after work started. 

I would say despite all these problems, love still glue us together and we are always never giving up on each other. We fought, we called it quit before but we are still together today.. because we are both persistent.

Just lately , I discovered that he was actually communicating more with his female colleagues as compare to with me. A lot more of his life, interesting videos and jokes. It broke my heart that he had been lying or masking some stuffs like his activities , his whereabouts etcs. I feel that those are important enough to let me know. Or maybe if it was in the past, he would tell me. 

I know perhaps the reason why he refused to tell me was because he was afraid that I would get jealous or angry. Don’t get me wrong, he ain’t cheating. Although the stuffs ain’t any big deal, I was very bothered by how truthfulness is lacking. I am worrying that if this continues, next time our trust might totally cease. 

I chose not to tell him or confront him because I know things will worsen and I’d rather try to absorb all the negativity myself. It’s actually hurting more. 

We are also not really progressing and I’m not sure if he wants to settle down or move on to the next step.  All in all, I felt rather insecure and uncertain lately.

I have tried my best not to make any obvious advances as I know that she is in a fully committed relationship but it also sucks to know that I may have been already friendzoned. Honestly, now that the module we are taking together has ended, I can not avoid feeling slightly disappointed that I will not be spending time alone with her every week anymore. I tried to make small and imperceptible efforts like getting her food, inviting her for meals before CCA and accompanying her close to where her next class is. I know that I have to keep these feelings for her to myself even if I badly want to express it. I think and hope that such feelings will just disappear overtime.

He doesn’t really like to dress up - shirt, chinos and loafers kinda fashion, he’s more of the t-shirt, jeans and some trainers kinda person. I know he’s pretty thrifty when it comes to money, and we rarely dine at high-end restaurants. He usually invests most of his salary, and I’m a little worried. Do guys tend to not buy expensive gifts because they don’t know what females like? Or do they just not see the need to buy something nice for their partner once in a while? Does he not love me? 

I know it could be different love languages and whatnot, but I’m genuinely confused by this whole situation. He can spend money on getting a gym membership, going for upgrading classes and whatnot, but not spend some money just to get me one nice thing. All I really want is just something pricey from him though... I know it isn’t right to think this way logically, because he’s working hard for our future, but yet my emotional side is messing me up??

1442,"so basically i broke up with my bf of four months but we have been on and off the past 2 years, lately it has been more stable (for 5 months) but due to commitment issues, for the time being we decided to just date instead of making things official. so heres the thing, it is both of our first relationships thus we dont rlly know how it works just that it feels right. we talked abt moving on and seeing new people to experience more because having been with only one partner, both of us dont rlly know how love is supposed to work except follow our gut feel. sounds stupid but u need to experience love to know what you truly want right? thus i dont know if im as bad as it sounds ""settling"" bc idk how other ppl will treat me and i dont know if im treating him the best a girlfriend can and should. i know for a fact that i rlly love him but the both of us are still so young and having spent 2 years of my youth with him, i m not sure if i shld let him go to find someone better than me. moreover he is going for a 6 month exchange programme soon and being a very insecure and jealous person, i know he wont be able to enjoy himself there because i would get upset if he gets close to any girls.during jc, i was so insecure abt the girls around him that it was the root cause for our fights and even multiple breakups, he eventually drifted from them to appease me... i was from a girls sch thus i am not very familiar with the guy-girl friends thing so i cldnt accept that he was close to so many girls. i dont want to restrict him from having fun with others bc knowing the person i am he will try desperately to not do anything to upset me as he wants to pursue a future with me (his best friend told me this in secret even tho he has never mentioned this to me, he cant express himself well). im afraid that because of my 10 year girls sch mentality will lead to his eventual unhappiness with me. i know that because of such an insecurity i restrict him from having fun :""(. during the two years i tried to not get affected when he studies with another girl alone or texts another girl etc but bc he grew up in coed schs so its normal for him. when he goes for faculty outing for e.g. to a beach, i would playfully say not to look at the his girl friends in bikinis but i am actually at home being insecure,.  i m not sure if I’m compatible for him? i feel like I’m not good enough for him due to my insecurity. i feel as tho this insecurity is invalid. and even tho he tries his best and has cut off all contact from his female friends, i can’t help but be upset at myself for being so controlling. not sure if I’m the one for him even tho he’s the one for me. feel that he can do so much better. he has told me that he does not want to find someone else because he feels that i treat him very genuinely and lovingly and he is so certain that other girls won’t treat him like that (bc of his friends bad experience with girls). i alw hang out with his friends and we get along well and they told him the they can tell i rlly love him. on the contrary, my best friend hates him to the core bc of the insensitive things he said coupled with the fact that he always hung out with this one girl that i was rlly uncomfortable with (she used to like him), so my friends ruled him as a player and disapprove of the rs, but she is out of the picture now. even though he was immature in the past and was mean to me, he’s better now and we both grew in the sense that we understand e/o more. i do love him a lot and even when we were on breaks i wld still look out for him. we have met each others parents and went overseas with each others’ fam. his family likes me a lot and so does mine. not sure why he wld stick with someone like me who gets jealous and upset easily. I’m afraid that my behaviour will take a toll on him. i m not sure if I’m toxic either.. i can’t help my insecurities. so yeah, do u think that i shld break up with him to let him find a girl not as problematic as i am? or shld i stick with him since he is willing to compromise w me? he is a very good guy, he is very proud and protective of me. however, because we r not official, on social media it seems as tho i do not have any boyfriend thus many guys constantly hit me up for my number, with that he doesn’t even make me block them he jus tells me to blow them off nicely… he’s a very decent guy and i love him so much so that i am willing to let him go and give him a chance to find someone better. not sure if its bc its my first time in love that i don’t know what i shld do and everything is by gut feeling? I’m scared that he doesn’t know what he is capable of receiving thus sticks w me :< tell me what i shld do pls and thank you for reading this :)

tldr; i hv a guy but i don’t know if i shld give him up so that he can find someone better.

It's a great first indication that the dude knows how to treat a person as a person regardless of gender. It automatically makes me more comfortable around him because I would see that other girls are. I'd be more open to asking him out or to accepting an invitation for a meal, should he offer. I'd be more interested in getting to know him as an individual, basically.

Plus, I'd wanna met his friends. There's nothing more wholesome in girl talk than gushing about a guy whom everyone agrees is wholesome. Some people can say that can lead to complicated situations where multiple people pine after one poor sap. But that reflects more on the piners and their ability to manage conflict than on the person pined after, y'know? Not sure if anyone else agrees?

Just a suggestion for students who will potentially take this module, try to find out one way or another who is your TA for labs if you can LOL
Some lab TAs are extremely nice and take so much time and effort to explain to you the various concepts. I even heard some send you emails and notes on how to write the code step by step and you literally have to just translate it into code. 
Whereas mine, on the other hand, takes an average of around 4-7 days to reply my emails and the content of the email usually contain things like ""maybe you should ask your friends""? My TA recently even completely ignored my email.
Do the lucky students with good TAs count as a case of plagiarism since they are literally translating english to java code? Who knows.

1464,"To OP of #72209

Here's another POV apart from the one from #72217

I used to be one who always check up on my friends as well. Asking them out for meals, catching up with them, only for the same to happen to me. They don't reply/say they're busy/say they'll get back to you after checking their schedule etc.

Obviously I was sad when I didn't get replies, thinking that they were not really good friends etc. But in recent times, I've became really caught up with school, family, work and everything else in between. This time around, I became the one who didn't reply and told them I'll get back to them, but ended up forgetting about it and not replying them at all.

What I'm trying to say is, yes, maybe your 'friends' aren't really quality friends, but until you've experienced being insanely busy, then you'll realise that it might actually be the truth. 

Last seen timings are toxic (which is why I turned em off) I had a few chats that I haven't opened just from sheer busy-ness and the only time I'm on my phone is when I'm checking in on group projects.

Bottom line, some of your friends are probably jerks, but some of your friends might actually be genuinely busy (you'll know, like in my case, I replied the individual chats explaining the 'ghosting'). And you'll soon learn to 'sieve' out who are the real friends and who aren't. But in the meantime, I think it's more important to take care of yourself, sometimes the checker needs to be checked in on at times, so maybe spend a little bit more time on yourself doing the things you like.

All the best and hang in there!

Thus, negative thoughts then came pouring into my head, making me wanted to give up at times.

The thing is, for a while now I've been feeling like I'm kinda being used or over-relied on and taken for granted. I do treat A as a good friend despite the fact that we don't meet up a lot (most of my friends are busy people and I am as well) and we give each other advice, hang out sometimes etc. However A has this bad habit so to speak. A would always ask me to check A's work. And by work I mean A's essays. And not just for one class but for multiple classes. And these aren't even classes that I'm taking or have taken before. A gets me to read these essays, and ask how to improve the content, if the essay is okay etc. Don't get me wrong, I am more than happy to help a friend in need and do this. Once or twice is fine. But this happens with almost every assignment A has, for almost every single class and across multiple semesters.

Either you intentionally left them out in your confession, or you collected your pack from the wrong faculty. 

2. You couldn’t even identify if the welfare director is a he or a she, and yet you complain that your time was wasted voting for the welfare director…?

1487,"Honestly as a bilingual Chinese Australian girl who is born in Shanghai and moved to Sydney when I was 13, I'm sick to the death of the divide between Singaporeans and Chinese international students. I came to NUS after finishing my high school in Sydney because why not since some of my relatives from China stay here for background information.

Why on earth does this have to happen? Because of certain norms held that you find unpleasant? Well let me tell you a story, I was bullied in my first year of high school for the exact reasons you guys hate them for. I was mocked for my poor English, the way I dressed, the mannerisms I carried over, I was so lonely and I could only hang out with other Chinese born students in my English as a second language class. I was bullied by Asian Australians who wanted nothing to do with me because they were afraid that someone like me undermined their social standing in Australia. I eventually adapted because in my ESL class, all international students of all backgrounds in my school suddenly started to make friends with each other based on our personalities and who we are as a person, not because of our cultural backgrounds. That way I could finally embrace Australian culture and learn to build bridges between international students in my high school and locals, and realise 'integration' cannot be forced.

Now coming into NUS, I see this very same divide and it reminds me of my high school days. I feel a sense of urgency to bridge this divide as a bicultural individual (well tbh I still find myself more Chinese than Australian because I still dress like someone from Mainland and my traditional values but still pretty Australian in my thought process). Please be understanding of this Chinese international students, they are already in so much financial burden and struggling. We honestly need a dialogue to find a comprimise to bridge this bitter divide.

1491,"To the OP of #72209,

I empathise with what you're feeling. It seems to me that you're a great friend who takes the initiative to ask your friends out and drop them a text to check in on them.

I have had similar experiences like you. I made efforts to ask a few close friends out on multiple occasions, only to get replies like ""I am really busy"", ""need to check my schedule first!"" (but never return as to when they're free), or ""see how"". When I text them, I've also gotten responses like the three you shared (don't open, blue tick, replies 2 to 3 days later).

There were also a few times friends shelved our pre-arranged meetings/dinners/lunches. Sometimes, they didn't even happen because the said friends were so busy and couldn't pin down an alternative date.

Like you, I know everyone is busy and I don't need a fast reply. I used to close one eye whenever this happened. But after multiple occasions, I wondered if I was the problem. I felt that I was someone who could be easily replaced. All these ate into my self-esteem.

It was even more ironic that these friends also told me before, ""how come my friends flake on me and don't reply or don't take initiative to ask me out"". Which hurt because that was precisely what they were doing to me. After repeated instances, I slowly weaned myself off from contacting them because ultimately, every friendship/relationship is a two-way process. Nobody is ""too busy"", it is all a matter of priorities. Cliche as it sounds, there is some truth in that.

I don't think whatever you experience is ""minor"" because it is through signs and actions like that which you can also tell how they treat you as a person. Of course, if it happens once or twice, I believe you're nice enough to look beyond it. But if it is a consistent pattern of behaviour, you might need to re-evaluate this friendship. And although you've been friends with them for many years, not all friends are meant to stay. I still look back at the fond memories we have, but ultimately, won't a friend who has been with you for many years (and would surely know your personality), also reciprocate and make the effort too?

Jiayou, hope things get better, and all the best during this busy period :)

Since I am still halfway through my degree, I originally planned to elope after graduation in 2 years time. However, due to visa issues, my GF cannot stay in Singapore that long. In any case, her hometown is a small village so there are few jobs available for uni grads - even my poly diploma is probably overkill. I am confident that since everybody knows everybody in her village, there is no problem finding a job once I arrive. Frankly, I am not a snobbish like other Singaporeans, so I don’t feel the need to waste even more time just to get a useless piece of paper. The quality of education in NUS is not as high as its rankings suggest, so I wont be missing out on much. 

And yet... even though logic dictates that I should drop out of NUS, I am hesitating. Do I just not love my GF enough to make this sacrifice for her? Am I subconsciously being racist and judgemental like my parents? Or am I just a spoilt singaporean brat who prefers material comforts over true love?

The mentality that legislation will solve all our issues is a stupid one, but also a very Singaporean one. It has always been like this - don't like something? Ban it! Singapore claims that it wants to be green, sustainable, and forward-thinking, but yet thinks that banning the cleanest form of last-mile transport is a better option than making up for the lack of dedicated cycling paths, or the lack of enforcement of errant riding behaviors.

1509,"Hello all, just a warning that it’s gonna be a long read ahead...

Recently, my friends (both females and males) have been increasingly flaking/ ghosting me on text and in real life... :( 

With regards to text, it’s always one of the following these days:

 1. Don’t open my message (but some of their last seen clearly says something ????).
2. Blue tick/ leave me hanging on  “seen” forever (?) (like until now it remains a blue tick/ “seen”).
3. Reads message, replies only 2-3 days later.

Sigh, I know it’s finals season and everyone is busy — I’m busy too. And I honestly don’t expect any instantaneous reply. 

But surely y’all can reply during your breaks as your day passes? It  doesn’t feel good at all when they leave me on read and take 2-3 days to reply me. I start to have self-doubts that I said/ done something wrong... :(

Personally, if I need more time to reply to a message, I would just drop one sentence “busy atm will reply later” so that I won’t leave people hanging. Am I being unfair/ demanding in wishing my friends at least let me know that they are busy and need more time before they can get back to my messages?

And speaking of flaking/ ghosting, I have made arrangements/ plans with some of said friends recently. Unfortunately, in the past two weeks, I have encountered last minute cancellations on me at least thrice already!! (Fyi, some of the plans were prearranged weeks ago, so these last minute cancellations kinda struck me real hard when I go onto Instagram stories and find out that the real reason I got ghosted is because they are busy hanging out with other friends... AKA I’m being replaced (?), like wow I’m lost for words.)

I’m angry, but more than that, I’m truly hurt. Why? Well, I have to laugh things off and pretend I’m “okay”, when in reality I’m far from okay. Just because we have been friends for years, and therefore I shouldn’t hold a grudge over such “small” matters aka forgive and forget? It’s one thing to be cancelled upon, but another thing when they don’t see the need to apologise on the account of our years of friendship?

I do not wish to put a strain on our years of friendship just because of these seemingly “minor” matters, but it still hurts that years of friendship may actually lead to complacency and overlooking of such basic respects as humans? :( 

I still love and cherish my friends and hoping this is just a temporary phase... I can’t help but start to question if the fault lies with me instead...

To those who read through that whole chunk of my lament: Thanks for sticking by, provide me with some advice please? :(

In the schools I studied at, my classmates often have a tunnelled focus on improving their grades, propping up their portfolios, and keeping a sharp eye out for extracurricular opportunities. In the places I interned at, my colleagues complained about work, but otherwise they worked on their project, then the next and the next and the next.

I expect some will tell me that's the working life, that there's little choice if you want to survive. Still, sometimes I will return from college and notice advertisements promoting tuition for pre-nursery kids. 

I think about finding a partner and having children in Singapore. The financial burden doesn't worry me as much. Instead, I wonder if I'll have the will and courage to not give in to the fear that has driven my parents' way of raising me. I don't blame them for placing pressure on my academics. They never cared about that until they met my classmates' parents, and unwittingly internalised the idea that their children's results determined their worth as mothers and fathers. I feel sorry for them, to be honest. I don't think our childhoods were quite what they wished for my sibling and I to have when they first decided to start a family.

The whole kiasu, kiasi thing used to be funny when I was younger, like it was normal and part of the Singaporean culture and identity. It doesn't feel amusing anymore. I'm 20 and I get I have so many decades ahead of me. Living in a safe and wealthy country is no small privilege either. Oftentimes I'm grateful for the things and relationships I have.

I can talk all I want about how societal approval shouldn't affect my day-to-day living. But I can't deny that it does and spending every moment trying to go against the grain tires me. I am tired of wanting to strive for excellence because of the fear that otherwise I will not be good enough. Most of all, I'm afraid that if I spend the rest of my life here, eventually I'd wake up on my deathbed and realise I haven't amounted to anything more than capital for a city I wish I loved.

The first time i saw him was during business oweek this year but we didn't have a chance to interact as I was a freshie and he was part of the organising comm and really busy. It's so hard to even start a convo because it would be so random and weird and I'm scared he thinks I am a creep. One of the night during the camp, he came to kr to bring the raggers back to oweek. I managed to talk to him for a bit and he was really super friendly and fun. and that's when i knew i really wanted to know him better, maybe if a relationship don't work out, we can still be friends. I didn't ask for his number or ig and we didn't interact with each other anymore. I would occasionally see him during my rag practices, i think he is from sheares rag or flag?? Just last week i walked past him but he didn't seem to remember me when i tried to say hi to him. It really breaks my heart... Right now, there's like 2 guys trying to chase me but I dont even feel anything for them because I am still hoping that one day I can have a chance with him. Help me.... what should i do?

1542,"Is having a chronic illness seen negatively in a job application? As a demerit? Almost all the job applications that I have submitted thus far, requires me to declare my medical condition (either in the initial stages or during the interview stage). 

Just some background FYI, I have been living with a chronic autoimmune condition since childhood but I have lived with it and gotten through school all these years and completed my degree without any problem. I am going for regular medical check ups and my condition is stable, confident for me to say that it will not affect my work. During interviews, I have been told to my face that “your illness is going to be a problem because you will be often gone for your medical checkups” (which only happens once every two- three months).  I have also been asked “how many medications do you take on a daily basis?” like that is going to matter, and hearing a huge sigh after I mention a number. 

How can I possibly prove that my illness is just part of me and is not going to affect my ability to work to the potential employers? 

Getting called to the interview stage and then being rejected, (albeit there might be other reasons such as my lack of work experience), I can’t help but think that my illness might be the reason. Compared with a perfectly healthy candidate, who would choose a candidate with a chronic illness over that, right? How do I overcome this?

Or is your self-esteem so low that you need scholars to hang out with you to feel good? I have E-Scholar friends from JC and Secondary School and they have never been snobbish towards anyone. Yes, they complain about people who do not do their work during group work but I believe that is justifiable so perhaps you're one of those leeches and hence people do not wish to ""mix"" with you. 

""they come from good JCs with excellent results"" is another story which you cooked up. If you had bothered to know more before flaming, you would realise that there is a substantial amount of them who are not from RJ/HC etc. Moreover, they started with school before us ""normal"" people so they would have already known each other. When thrown into a mix of people, would you not CHOOSE to hang around those that you already know? Would you not hand around your JC friends or people you know through orientation? By not hanging out with the rest of your ""normal"" cohort, does it not make you an exclusive person as well? (As well as being hypocritical)

Kindly stop creating drama and tension when there wasn't any to begin with.Would anyone in the right frame of mind, scholar or not, want to hang out with toxic people like you? Have you even tried interacting with an E-Scholar or are you assuming they are arrogant and elitist simply because they did not approach you first?

I come from a humble family: my father earns about max 2k a month and my mother is a housewife. Before my fiance and I got graduated, our meals will be paid by my parents. For example, when we go to hawker centers, my mother would pass us about $20 to settle our meals. Just a note,  my fiance comes from a well-to-do family and has a lot more allowance than I do. Both of us started working after we graduated and am earning about 4k (me) and 4.5k (him). However, he has never once treated my family a meal before, not even a cup of coffee to my mother. A case that happened recently, when my family decided to go to a hawker center to settle our lunch, he didn't even bring his wallet out and my mother had to pay his $6 meal since they queued up at the same store. It became a habit for him and I do know that this cannot go on like this. He is very generous to him and myself in terms of food but really stingy to other people. Please advise on how I should let him know about this bad habit of his because his stinginess really turns people away from him and it is really difficult to inform him about this.

1551,"Dear NUS students,

I am so happy that I discovered this NUSWhispers Facebook page. During my times at NUS 7 years ago, the page was called “NUS Confessions” (I remember that when it was created, it caused some controversy in conservative and prudish Singapore), and I was curious why the page had become inactive. I am glad to see that the NUS Confessions page has continued by becoming NUSWhispers.

I was an exchange student from Europe (I don’t want to give too many details about my country, as some people might recognise me) at NUS during the 2012/2013 academic year, and reading through the confessions makes me so nostalgic about my year abroad there. I wanted to share with you that this year has been unforgettable for me, probably the best in my life so far. I met some people who became my best friends, and met my first love there. Although we are not together anymore (thank you long distance relationship), we are still close friends and I still cherish today the memories of our times together.

I visited Singapore recently for the first time since I left in 2013, and it was such a pleasure for me to go back to the places where I had so many good memories : I saw that U-Town is now fully completed (and what an amazing place it is for students !). I also went back to the Foodclique food court at U-Town, where I had an Indian meal, which was my favourite. 

This meal was like a Proust Madeleine for me ; so many more forgotten memories came back to my mind as I closed my eyes and ate the fluffy and crispy roti prata and tasted the spices and textures of the briyani rice and flavourful curry and vegetables. Later on, I went back to the U-Town swimming pool (my old NUS card still worked, I didn’t expect that !), and watched with delight the sun set over the graduate residence towers and people chilling and playing together on the U-Town green, reminiscing myself with nostalgia that I was one of these people I was watching 7 years ago. I also took advantage of my stay in Singapore to walk and explore the hidden gems of the city.

Singapore truly feels like a second home to me, and it will forever be associated with the great memories of my youth years. I just wanted to share these memories with you via this post, and tell you that your country will always have a special place in my heart.

Sending you lots of love,

XXXXXX

I matriculated into uni, expanded my social circle a few times more than the one I had back when I was 18. Due to the lack of communication, meet ups etc, he started getting insecure which leads to his jealousy. But we still hung on till his ORD. Thought everything would carry on like how it did before he got into army and I got into uni, but somehow, things started getting worse. Even his mom came into the picture. She kept complaining about the number of male friends I hang out with. And although he always defends me, both of us knew that the relationship wouldn't work out if it continued this way so we came to a decision and broke up.

6 months have passed and I haven't gotten over him. My heart feels so empty. I miss his smile, his existence, his messages in the morning, his sweet gestures and all the effort he puts into the relationship. I still read his messages during my free time and look through our photos every other night. What made it even worse, since both of us applied and got into the same major, we constantly bump into each other on campus. He would be holding a cup of iced milo which I used to make him quit the coffee addiction he had during A levels. And every single time I take a glance, he would be wearing the watch both of us got for our 2nd anniversary. Since both of us separated on good terms, although we don't contact, he would still wave when our eyes meet but I'd always pretend that I didn't notice.

It's been 6 months and I still love him. The urge of getting back with him is really strong especially when I see him on campus, but my friends discouraged me from goimg back to him. I'm just really afraid he doesn't feel the same way anymore since it has been quite a while or what if he already has a girlfriend, since there is this girl who is frequently on his insta story. Or if we actually got back, the same problem would arise. I'm super conflicted. How?

Forced to study something I don't like in Accountancy in Uni and forcing me to stop my interest in music during studies because 'it will affect my studies'.

Then she said, ""listen to Ma for the final time. Go become an auditor, and I will not bother you in any choices you make in the future.""

I thought that since we had something special even outside of the game, we were ""official"". But when I confronted her about it, she insisted that to her, in game relationships are a separate issue and that I'm not really her boyfriend?

I don't know why but I just felt so hurt by that because I always treated her special and finding out that she never felt the same way about me after all these months just hurts so bad.

Am I the only one who takes his relationships even in game seriously? I mean, if we never talked outside of the game I would maybe understand but it wasn't just ""in-game"" to me... I'm just so angry at myself for getting so worked up over something so stupid, and something that even she doesn't care about... I'm just so dumb...

I successfully pursued my girlfriend while she was still attached and I got her pregnant soon after. I love her, and this news only accelerated my decision to marry her. The problem is, our parents do not see eye to eye with each other and had a heated argument during the first meeting.

My parents’ view is that we are not financially independent and both are studying. 

My gf’s mum has been showing support although she did mention that her preference is for her daughter to marry when she is independent.

My parents have come to a compromise to allow us to marry, the only criteria is a simple tea ceremony with my gf and I serving tea and greeting my parents as mom and dad.

My gf’s mum has taken this to issue. Citing that my gf’s mum has passed away last year so it is inauspicious to have tea ceremony 3 years from the death. But she is ok with rom and a simple wedding lunch or dinner.

I just graduated recently and currently have a full time job and I just want to hide in my room and play games, surf the net, eat and sleep the whole day during the weekends and days off. I am the only child and never had any friends growing up. I think it has made me emotionless towards people and dislike socializing. I never intend to get a girlfriend and marry. I am living with my parents and don’t intend to buy a car, property, travel, expensive things etc except maybe games I like and the required computer hardware. I spend very little and my savings can last a long way should I retire early in future and become a full time hikikomori. My parents are upper middle class and have sufficient assets themselves. I think this kind of semi hikikomori lifestyle will be great as I can just hide in the comfort of my room but yet still contributing to my household expenses and society. What do you guys think?

1577,"I really just need to get this off my chest. I have a friend (not super close but I do quite enjoy his company when we hang out together) who will always not pay me back whenever we dine out together, be it in a huge group dinner or just a small gathering. I do earn quite a bit from my job as I am doing sales. The commission is great and I’m one of the few top sales performers in my department.  

I knew this friend from work (he was an intern) and he was placed at my department, hence he has a rough idea of how much I earn each month as our company openly shares a rough gauge of the potential paycheck that you can earn if you do XX amount of sales in a bid to attract more people to join. The thing is, I will always volunteer to pay first when we dine out as a group with the other interns out of courtesy as I’m already working full time, but when I split his share of the food and informed him of the amount that he needs to transfer back to me, he will say ok but the money will never ever come even after a few reminders. This has gone on for at least 2-3 dinners and the worst thing is, he started bringing his boyfriend along with him for these group dinners (saying that they don’t spend enough time tgt due to work and school) and guess what, the boyfriend does not pay me back as well. After about 2-3 more times with the boyfriend, I stopped asking him along for these dinners and recently he kept replying to my instastories, in a bid to get some attention like saying “oh bojio!!” I just ignored his messages. 

To me it’s simple, even if I earn a lot of money a month, it does not give you the right to leech off me simply because I can so-called, “afford the additional expense”. I earned the money with hard work, clocking in late nights during weekdays, giving up time with loved ones during weekends to go in for work and even giving up additional sleep hours. I’m a generous person who is ok to treat people for special occasions, but team dinners are not special occasions and just blatantly pretending to “forget” to pay me back after multiple reminders is not acceptable. The other interns has no issues with paying back their part of the meal so I don’t see why he can’t do the same.

1578,"Either you went into architecture knowing what you were getting into, or you went into architecture not knowing what you were getting into.

I'm not saying the department is right. The hours that I'm working are really inhumane, the facilities leave a lot to be desired, and the fact that they decided to renovate literally the whole entire faculty at once is ridiculous.

But the above statement is still true. You either knew what you were getting into, or you didn't.

If you did, like me, know what you were in for, I don't see why you have a right to complain. I signed up for this, and despite knowing what kind of dog life I'd eventually lead, I still signed up for it. That's my choice, and I'm responsible for the effects of my choice, even if it entails that I haven't slept in 4 days, and my average number of hours of sleep per day depends on how many days I actually get sleep.

If you didn't know what kind of crap you were getting yourself into, then I can only say that you should have done your ""due diligence"", as one of my profs likes to say. I don't think his usage of it is doing it any justice, but what I'm saying is that nobody chooses a university degree blindly. If you were to go for an Arts degree without knowing what it entails, you'd spend sleepless nights writing essays. If you chose Engineering blindly, you'd be stumped by the math. If you chose Science, you'd be reading your lecture materials through the night.
This isn't just some hyperbole I came up with on the fly. My friends in other faculties are dying too. I still like to think I'm dying faster than them, but it doesn't change the fact that we should know what we're getting into.

But here's the thing. You don't need the laser cutter. You don't need massive space at home. Those are nice to have, but non-essential. I've seniors who submit their stuff early not because they're masters of whatever modeling you can think of, but because they went to do everything by hand. Not saying we're all capable of it, but it can be done, so don't blame the lack of facilities. They're there to make your life easier, not there as a prerequisite for your completion.

That said, I'd still want the department to wake up though.
Better facilities and less controversial professors, more availability and a nicer environment...

But until you see that what's enabling them to teach architecture ""the wrong way"", which is that people are still blindly signing up for it, you will see that they have no reason to change things.

1579,"In response to post #71999, I am quite astonished – and strongly disagree with – your stance. I, too, am an archi student and I will like to point out that the department has made actual, concrete steps to alleviate our clashing deadlines. 

As a Y2 student, I must say that this semester has been really much better, in terms of workload, as compared to the previous semesters. Take for example AR2221 – its essay submissions and tutorial preparations have been carefully scheduled and spaced out such that we have ample time to put sole effort into them, such as the one entire free week set aside after final crits for us to write it. And that is already excluding the fact our tutorial preparations have already helped us to engage in the preliminaries of our essays. Another example will be AR2524 – its weekly deadlines on Sunday, 6pm ensures that we are able to at least spend some time engaging meaningfully with it. The final submission for it was also well-planned and spaced out; its deadline was a good 3 weeks before final crits and I am pretty sure such an arrangement is better than having it nearer finals. To add on, for our Interim 1, AR2524 lecture was cancelled (by the lecturer’s and presumably DOA’s initiatives), as well as us being given an extra week to complete the weekly submission, just so that we could focus on AR2101 Interim. I can’t say for sure if you or the other years have experienced such good planning this sem (definitely a huge improvement from last year and even then, DOA acceded without hesitation to shift our deadlines), but considering the initiative towards good scheduling this sem for us Y2s, its quite safe to say that the lower and upper years should be experiencing the same too.  

In light of this, I implore you to reconsider your stance. Sure, the email may have been edited and resent, but as my senior said, the previous anonymous email had a clerical error which forgot to mention the prof’s name. So the prof sent it again, this time edited to ensure that when more people read it, it would resonate with them. Of course, perhaps the new email could have mentioned briefly that it was a follow up of the previous email, just as a signpost to avoid people like you who may misread and misunderstand the prof’s intentions. Yet, with the pretty harsh words you and some of the other posts used, surely such a careless omission of signposting in the new email can be forgiven, since the email was intended to address the immediacy of the situation?

To the rest of my fellow Y2s and the other years as well, I hope that we can acknowledge the fact that DOA has indeed put in effort to mitigate clashing deadlines without us students having to point them out. These initiatives were already being communicated to us at the start of the sem during the intro lectures, and I cannot help it if those who missed these lectures or skipped them continue to think otherwise. Likewise, those who are unable to manage your time properly and leave preparations to the last minute, I urge you to cultivate this skill now, lest you go out into the workforce and make such a blunder again in biting back at the very hands that fed you. 

Do not take advantage of what has been already been provided for you. All the best for final crits.

PS: Im a Y2 student and not a staff of DOA, jic someone wants to flame me for my support towards DOA’s initiatives this sem.

1580,"With recent stories regarding architecture followed by a few feedbacks from the department and student leaders, it seems that the issues are coming from a higher level of management. We’re one of the top 10 universities for pursuing architecture, and yet we have to put up with the studio conditions and a serious lack of facilities. I believe that the department of architecture has done their job in fight for us, but that just means that the university isn’t. We are paying our schools fees too, so let’s not talk about lowering our expectations and let us expect the facilities that we deserve. Yes we do have good tutors and perhaps leaders in the department, but that’s clearly not enough for anything to be done from the university level. If we are really one of the top 10 universities for architecture, then please provide us facilities that are comparable to the other top universities, and not just show us a number to make us feel better about ourselves.

Dear friend, I miss you. I lost a friend of mine february this year. He's the kind of guy that lives life to its fullest. The kind that is easy to talk to, hardworking and cares for everyone around him. Also the kind of guy that is impossible hate. One would describe him as someone that is good with people. Maybe because it's part of his job as he needs connections but also one to speak harsh truths when you're screwing up. That friend who would say ""LAY OFF THE FRIES. YOU'RE GETTING FAT"" in a joking manner. It's something that I really appreciate because true friends tell you harsh facts about yourself and call out your bullshit.

I would often chat with him on the phone, asking him for advice about almost everything. Relationships, studies, sharing about our passion for watches to even making smart life choices. You know those friends that you want to chat with but they say I'll call you back later but they don't? This guy does, no matter how busy he is. Well, I would label him as a mentor/friend/brother. 

But this one night, I wanted to give him a call to check up on him, since he shared with me some personal problems of his own. It was 11pm and I've just left the campus, feeling exhausted. So I thought, hey I'll just call tomorrow. We can always chat another day. 

The next morning, I receive a text from an ex-colleague with a link to a news website. ""**** got into a car accident."" ""Excuse me? Is this a joke?"", I murmured to myself. The article wrote, saying that the car burst into flames and the body couldn't be identified but there were #**** to his name at the bottom of the article.. Called him right away but no answer. I texted him but there was only 1 tick on whatsapp. That 1 tick you see where it means the message can't be delivered,  it felt like it's not a mistake anymore. He's gone. Right away, I texted his sisters, asking if it's true and they sent me an invitation to his wake. Then reality hit me.

The regret of not calling him the previous night sank it right away. Tears drizzled down uncontrollably even though they we’re not suppose to cry. How could someone just be gone in an instant? The promise we made to see each other again in march was gone. What if I called? Would the circumstances have changed? The amount of pain you would think he would have to go through before he left. Unable to identify the body because it was burnt?? My friend went through that?? That friend that I wanted to call? That very friend whom I talk to almost everyday? 

It’s been more than half a year and I still regret not calling him that very night. That procrastination whereby you think to yourself “meh, I’ll just call the next day.” But that next day will never come again.

It’s almost the end of 2019. Personally, it’s the toughest year that I’ve gone through so far.

I lost a great friend, I lost my relationship and I got diagnosed with Major Depression.
It’s scary that life will get tougher in the future. It's scary that these are not the only things I will lose.

1584,"Reading post #71864 made me feel very guilty, so here is a confession.

When I was 18 years old, I was horny (like many other teenagers) yet forced to stay at home to study for Alevels, so I started flirting with my domestic helper. Since her English was not very good, I was able to convince her to have unprotected sex. I was also able to convince her that letting me ejaculate inside her would be easier than having to wash the bedsheets all over again. Yes, I know I was wrong. I was a very selfish person back then. 

Eventually, her contract ended and she returned to her home country. Some time later, my family received a phone call from her saying that she was pregnant with my child. Imagine if you were a parent and a maid accused your son of fathering her child. Would you believe her? Of course not! I poisoned the well still further by making up false stories about her stealing money from my wallet etc.  Before long, my family was convinced that she had integrity issues. My family ignored her calls. Eventually, my father got fed up and scolded her over the phone, accusing her of lying, threatening to call the police and asking her to leave our family alone. The calls stopped after that. I was very happy and boasted about it to my friends and NS buddies. Eventually, everyone got bored with my story and I moved on to other conquests, so I kind of forgot about the entire incident. until recently.

Today, with the benefit of maturity and hindsight, I truly and sincerely regret what I did. As a married man now, I completely understand the difficulties involved in raising a child. I imagine that it is orders of magnitude more difficult to raise a child as a single parent. Originally, I intended to fly over to look at the child and confirm whether he is indeed mine before taking further action. However, on second thoughts, I realized that it dosent matter whose child it is: I had done a grave wrong, so I should make compensation irregardless. In addition to a significant lump sum payment, I intend to also sponsor the child’s accomodation, air fare and tuition fees if the child manages to get a place in NUS in a few year’s time. And I will NOT do any paternity testing.

This post is a reminder to all the other guys on NUSWhispers to do the right thing and treat their women well.

I cared nothing about my soft skills or character development. While I do know that soft skills are equally important if not more important, it is only after I had went out for internship that I realised how terribly lacking I am in my soft skills. I literally have zero soft skills compared to my peers. I feel like I have no valuable skills at all to contribute to the workforce. Soft skills wise, I do not know how to navigate people, can’t communicate well, am not likeable, not a problem solver. Knowledge wise, I will always fall short of my peers and my grades are below average. I am really worried what will happen after I graduate, after I no longer have the cushion of being a student.

The reason I say she is 'abnormally normal' is because other friends who have also been through a break up would either confide in me or rant about their ex without me asking, but as for her case, she functions absolutely normally. If I were to nitpick on her behavior, she laughs and smiles even more, talks even more, and she has a totally different vibe and I'm worried she is just putting up a facade so that people won't be worried.  Furthermore, I can see her puffy eyes even with those makeup. Whenever I asks if she is ok, she just shrugs it off casually. Or if I were to bring up the topic, she changes it immediately. I've been friends with her for 9 years and I know that she treats this relationship very seriously, and she has always been the kind who likes bottling up her feelings.

Most of my close friends from Poly/Army either went to NTU/SMU/SUSS or are now out in the workforce, so didn’t have any close friends coming to NUS with me.

I do stay on campus, and I did join CCA’s to make friends, but it always feels like there’s a distance between me and most people here. Especially as I do not come from JC, I don’t even have an O level cert, as I was from Normal Acad. Furthermore, in Army I was just a trooper, not even a Spec/Occifer like most guys here, so even then it can be hard to relate.

I am actually very vocal about my mental health and my friends know that I can be unstable sometimes. But the fact is that I know that they have their own lives so ever since a few months ago I have been just keeping things to myself.

I have also opened up to my family members (selective tho not all) and like they offer to help but sometimes what I say gets shot down so I'm kinda just sad like I hope people will just listen instead of brushing off the topic. Tho I understand that not a lot of people are comfortable listening to my rants and its okay.

But recently it feels like even if I want to talk about it, I cant put my thoughts to words anymore. And yeah I feel very empty and like despite my efforts to actually vanish and take a break from everyone, FOMO still stands and there are times i feel that even if I wasnt around nobody would notice which is a red flag I know.

I hate that I'm like that and I honestly tried so hard to be positive like its been going on since like 1 year ago. Sometimes I breakdown within a few hours or even minutes, or if things went well maybe like a few weeks, but breakdowns are bound to happen anyways.

In essence, these emails were sent to “show us care and concern”, admittedly in a knee-jerk response to the recent rants about the Architecture student life at NUS.

I would just like to ask the Department, how sincere are you in these apparent signs of “care and concern”? Throughout my course of study so far, I have never once seen emails like these which remind us to take care of our health. The most recent email, by a Professor herself, seems very comforting to read AT FIRST GLANCE. But, I realised that the email was just a copied, pasted and edited email which was sent much earlier. How sincere can that get?

We architecture students are already putting in our best efforts in juggling work and health. We do not need your insincere, knee-jerk and tokenistic emails to start doing so. If you are really sincere, these emails would have been put into actual action. Sometimes, I wonder, when we are being touted for the need to walk the talk as architects, is the Department setting a good example?

I am sure many of my fellow course mates agree that reading these emails that only serve to cover the Department’s heads amid the recent fall-out incidents in studio is all the more agitating, given that we are in the midst of our final leg for finals and yet we have to read these seemingly comforting but in reality pretentious words of care and concern. This last leg is arguably the most intense part of any archi student’s semester, where we just want to focus now on producing work that echoes the best of our project’s design.

(We also hope that this hard work and sleepless nights will greatly satisfy the jury panel on the final Crit days, even if at the expense of our health and wellbeing. After all, we are being marketed as (non)humans who do not need to eat, sleep and shit.)

Some background about me, i'm an average guy that doesnt particularly shine in any aspects (ie. Looks, grades, wealth) And i came across this girl that i've like in primary 1 while we were in the same class.

Since then, i have been her secret admirer throughout our primary school phrase. She was like a perfect role model that is looked well upon by the school and students. Thus enlarging our distance to become friends. After our graduation, we lost contact and social media is not a norm in those years.

I made a point to remain single as she is the only one that ever cross my mind and friendzoned all advances from other girls. I have this constant thought about her every night before sleeping for the past 18 years (ie. Is she doing well, eating healthily, etc.)

Fast forward, after graduation and working in MNC, my colleague who has no relation to her, had chance upon her contact number and she's currently pursuing a business major in NTU (ahem.. CSI).

I'm so happy to hear that she's doing well and looked up on her social media platform to find thst she rarely posts things online. Through her dp in whatsapp, im quite confident that the number is genuine as she looks almost the same after so many years.

Im having thoughts if i should initiate a conversation with her as i feel there's only one chance and i cant mess up.

Would greatly appreciate if girls can share their thoughts about receiving random text from some dude so many years back as acceptable or creepy., and if there are other methods or suggestions to recommend. Thanks alot for your time.

There’s this guy I game together with since last year and we started dating since we met around 4 months ago. 

He is super sweet and nice to me. The thing is, he has really traditional, conservative, restrictive parents. Both his parents are quite old and have retired years ago. At age 23, he has never once spent the night outside, never brought a friend home, never had a single part time job because his parents think those jobs are useless (the only income he earned for himself was from NS) , get fined for using phone in toilet at home, and though he claims his curfew time is a “grey area”, he never seem to reach home past 12. The list goes on...

There was once when his parents were overseas yet he still refused to bring me to see his house because he was so scared of being found out. The one time I was in his neighbourhood he had to constantly look out for his parents too. 

He knows that his parents shouldn’t make such unreasonable rules but he already had that fear of defiance in him since childhood, when he got beaten a lot and almost got chased out of house from lying. It’s not like I can pressure him to defy his parents. Even when I ask him if he can new year countdown with me he just says “I really don’t know”. It’s like he can’t and won’t even try. I really like him  but I’m not confident that in the long term his parents will be more chill and give him more freedom (judging by how his much older sisters are as heavily guarded as himself). I also fear that since his parents are strictly religious and I’m a free thinker they might force me to convert or simply force him to break up with me. 

I know it’s still early to worry about such problems but I feel like I’m dating a primary school kid even though he is mature on the inside. Should I wait it out? What should I do?

1597,"A letter to an unrepentant sibling: 

How do you change somebody when they are unreceptive of feedback? I’ve officially given up communicating with a sibling of mine, because talking about simple issues can get me emotionally hurt and distressed, and I don’t think I deserve such emotional punishment. Giving feedback to another sibling never ends well, so I’ve given up - I’ve got my mental health and sanity to protect. 

PS: I’m not the perfect sibling or human being, but I just want to address the distress, and get it off my chest.

Dear XX, 

You have been the cause of my emotional turmoil for many occasions in my life. The fact that I have to write this letter instead of talking to you face-to-face, shows how much I detest in-person confrontations with you. It’s also a testament to how talking to you in person does not work out, because what often begins as a simple feedback regarding your behaviour, ends up as a very uncomfortable argument. Not only do we fail to reach an agreement on what we can compromise - interactions with you end off with a bitter taste, which only makes me regret having brought up the issue with you. 

When presented with feedback, even in the most polite way, you only respond with an extreme level of self-defensiveness, spite, and a vengeance to inflict emotional discomfort on me. For someone working in a sector of providing care and support, you seem to be very skilled and inclined towards inflicting pain on others. When you’re caught in a distressing situation, it appears to me that you have to drag others down into an emotional turmoil as well - and you deliver this through your words, actions, and even tone. You’re really a master at making others emotionally uncomfortable. 

I have completely lost trust in the way you handle feedback, and even as I write this, I expect the worst reaction from you if you ever read this letter. You really have zero capacity to process feedback without having the need to make me miserable. In fact, I’ve thought of writing this letter and leaving it at your desk before I fly off - but knowing your spiteful nature, I can expect a nasty phone call or message from you while I’m on a holiday, and I don’t wish to risk that. That’s the impression I have of you. And that’s exactly the nasty things which I can expect from a resentful person like you.

Why is it so hard for you to practice mindfulness, and watch your tone when you disagree with me? I’m perfectly okay if you speak up for yourself when I call you out on certain behaviours, but there’s no need for you to use such a bitter, resentful and spiteful tone. I think you’re really out to hurt others.

I honestly think you need help for the sense of resentment that’s built up inside you. You have no capacity to repent, or think from the shoes of others. You have zero mindfulness or consideration for other people’s feelings, because you’re too busy dishing out yours.

I can recall the times when conversations with you have left me extremely uncomfortable. Perhaps it was the way you snapped at me when I politely told you that you could be rude at times. Remember that time you yelled at me because I implied that you might stretch out my clothes? I lost my appetite for dinner that day, even though my favourite noodle dish was being cooked. 

That’s the kind of impact you have on me. 

I look back on my life, and thought of all the times you’ve snapped at me, and treated me rudely. Not only did you want to convey your unhappiness (which is perfectly fine), you wanted to make me feel bad. That’s very, very petty and vengeful of you. And you wonder why I don’t share details of my life with you. 

I wish I could snap back, and impose on you the exact kind of misery that you’ve inflicted on me. But that would just make my life super miserable. I appreciate having a peaceful home. So I guess emotionally blocking you out, and staying indifferent is the best way to protect my sanity now. You need to seek help for your resentment issues. Even the family is afraid of your temper. It’s not that they condone your behavior - they just don’t want to face your temper. I guess it’s left with me to speak up for myself.

I’m sorry for the stressful life you have, and the nasty comments you get from our relatives who compare between the both of us. But you should really be mindful of the impact your words have on others. All I ask for is a peaceful home, where I don’t have to panic when I brush my teeth, fearing you might start pounding angrily on the bathroom door. I think it’s perfectly fine if you call me out for using the bathroom too long, but you don’t have to be rude about it. 

I’ve have enough anxiety in my life, I could do without having a source of negative energy at home. 

Thanks, 
Your very emotionally distressed sibling

When I researched a bit further, I realise that some of my higher SES friends have heard about it. None of them were invited to the parties though. 

My girlfriend who works in the hospitality sector told me that certain five - star hotel private dining rooms in the Orchard Road area are often booked for such purpose, for people to interact with other fellow mates of similar socioeconomic status. 

Was wondering if anyone else has heard of this dining club and if they still organise such events. As a sociology grad, this is both amusing and relevant in the broader national conversation on class.

1600,"Mu parents have been overly sensitive about things. From banning me to get in relationships, putting curfews on me (1am), not allowing me to go drinking and on. This got me rather stressed and restrained and I'm not sure what to do. Even a simple meal with someone of the opposite gender will get them raging, thinking that I'm in a relationship with the other person and will reprimand me. 

Some might say since I'm living under the same roof as them,I have to just follow the curfews and stuff. I'll just let that be and in addition to that I even inform them about my whereabouts. But i find it constraining that I have to not go out with friends of opposite gender. Like hello I'm in university and I would say it's nearly impossible that you would not interact with people from opposite genders. I had no choice but to lie quite often, but there are times where they see me eating with my friends (SG is small so...). I cant even go drinking in peace. 

How can I convince them that I'm mature enough to decide my life without them interfering? 

I'm in a relationship as well, but I want to date my partner openly without having to hide him from my parents. If I were in his shoes I'll feel pretty upset about it. 

No troll advice please

1601,"In JC, I came out of the closet as a gay man. At that time, I faced alot of discrimination from everybody: my parents were very angry with me, many of my friends left me and even random acquaintences whom I barely knew started giving me wierd looks. 

Since then, things have changed for the better. My parents are now accepting of my lifestyle, I made new friends (of course, my very best friends never left me) and I no longer care about what strangers think. I don't have the statistics to back this up, but I think that in recent years, Singaporean society in general has become less judgemental and more welcoming. Also, I would like to give special thanks to my very wonderful partner who has been very supportive during the past few years. Thank you, everybody. I couldn't have survived the past few years without your help.

The problem is this: I dont feel attracted to guys anymore. I have no problems performing in bed with my partner, but emotionally speaking I am just not into it anymore. On the other hand, I find myself attracted to girls around me. I also started a new cmb profile and matched up with a girl.  We may not have not had penetrative sex yet, but we have already progressed to the stage of kissing/heavy petting. I really want to pursue this new relationship further. To be perfectly honest with myself, I think that I was straight all along, and my homosexual inclinations were just part of my attention-seeking, teenage rebellious phase which I have since outgrown. I am sorry for all the emotional trauma that my parents and ex-GF had to suffer on my behalf. I am sorry for all the drama within my social circle. I wish I could turn back the clock. 

Should I come out of the closet again as a straight man? I really like this girl and I do want to take my new relationship to the next level. On the other hand, I am worried about what my friends will think. Also, in the past few years, I have helped out with advocacy efforts for the LGBT community in Singapore/NUS. I have also given advice to some of my juniors about LGBT matters. Today, even though I now consider myself a straight man, I still mantain close ties with the LGBT community and I am afraid of the community backlash if they find out the truth.

1603,"Some backstory, I try to not make it long. I've known my best friend for a long time, really long, since we were four. Maybe even longer. We lived in small town and we were neighbors. Our parents know each other. We grew up together, but I didn't start getting attracted to her until I started getting interested in girls, and at this point the relationship already turned into a ""brother-sister"" relationship. But we were kids. I doubt this thing would work anyway.

Time passed. We started maturing, she started to dating. At this point, I realized this ship has sailed, and started dating other women as well, while still being friends with her. I still had feelings for her, but I decided to bury them. It really worked, our friendship was great. We were the best friends. Time was passing.

That was going on until four days ago. Recently I broke up with my ex because she cheated on me. That kinda broke me, and I kinda realized now it was one of the reason why I did what I did. But anyway, after I broke up with my ex I started reevaluating my life. I realized that I can bury those feelings all I want, but I still love her. And after all those years I love her even more. I decided, that I should confess all my feelings to her. I was scared how she could react. I was scared if that will break up our longtime friendship. I was scared to lose one of the most important people in my life. But I realize that I had to do it. Because If I didn't know how she feels about me, it would eat me for the rest of my life. And frankly, it would be making and her a favor by confessing my feelings.

So, four days ago I told her I want to meet up with her and told her something important. We meet up at my place and basically told her the whole deal. I almost chickened out, but when I told her It felt like a huge stone just disappeared from my heart. I think I almost passed out.

Her reaction. At first, she thought it was a joke. Like, it was a while before she realized I was 100% serious. And once she realized that, she went completely berserk. Lots of screaming, lots of yelling, lots of crying, lots of cursing. I tried explaining her everything but she couldn't hear it. In her opinion, I lied to her for years, decades. That our whole friendship was a lie. I explained to her our friendship was 100% real all this years, and it was sincere. But I explained to her I can no longer live not knowing how she feels about me. So I asked her how she feels about me. Again, lots of screaming, yelling, crying etc but her answer was basically ""I don't know"" and ""You can't just drop a bomb on me like that"", and repeating that every 5 minutes. After an hour she told me she needs to think about it alone and left.

Three days ago, I got a text from her saying she wants to talk. This time at her place. I've never seen her so depressed as that day. It was like talking to a different person. The talk was mostly her repeating ""why didn't you tell about this sooner"", ""why now"" again and again. I told her I just have to be sure about her feelings towards me. After some time she finally told me that yes, she had feeling for me in the past. But since I never shown any interests toward her she assumed I didn't have any interests in her and treated this as friendship so she dropped it as well. I asked her if there's any chance for us. Her answer was ""I don't know"" ""maybe"" ""this is too much for me"". So I told her we can continue this conversation when she sorts her out if she needs more time. Two Days ago I get a call not from her, but her roommate. She told me she knows everything because she told her everything, and the she's been crying all day long ""because of me"". I called her if we can talk, but she told me she needs time. Then her another friend called me, and then it kinda stopped being a private matter.

Yesterday I get a message from her friend that she doesn't want to leave house and that she completely shut down. I asked her friends if I could talk to her but she told me that's not a good idea. I also got a call from her parents (yeah) asking me if all the stuff are true. I confirmed, they weren't happy about it, but they understand my decision. I knew her parents for a long time and they are great people.

And now Today, she finally texts and tell me she wants to talk. We talk, and I try to be more demanding this time. I told her I need to know if she has any feelings toward me. It took a while, but yes, she told me she still has some feelings toward me, and would like to at least try the relationship. When I was leaving, she told me to wait, and kissed me. It shocked me, and I could feel the awkwardness in the air. I left after that. This has never happened before, she might have kissed me on the cheeks or something in the past but nothing like that.

This comes to my question. What to do? Was that a good thing what I did? Does that thing has a future? I feel like today was a good thing, but I still feel doubts. I also feel very guilty, and over the past these days I felt like something bad was going to happen. Was her reaction good? Do I have to worry about her?

TL;DR: Confessed love to my best friend since we were kids. After I confessed her feelings for me she reacted strongly, said she needed time but after few days she told me she has feelings for me and kissed me. I don't know if I did the right thing, and what to do now.

Could you share some thoughts and advice regarding on the part-time degree BTech(Computing) programme in NUS? 

How is this BTech(Computing) course different from BEng(Computer science) part-time course in NTU? Is the modules/coverage not as indepth as compared to the full-time course in NUS? Is there bell-curve in BTech (if have, it is within part-time students only or the whole sch)? Is the BTech course offer similar modules as the full time programme? Is this fast-paced?

Noticed there isn't any BTech(Computer Science) course, whereas there is BTech(Software Engineering) course. Would like to understand why there isn't any BTech computer science course as there is a full-time programme on this, but instead it has a BTech Software Enginnering course which NUS currently offers Master course on this. What is the difference between CS and SE, and any reason why BTech programme is on SE instead of CS?

Is BTech cert recognized by employers? Is the employment rate high? As given from the name of the cert, it would be easily recognized that it is not a full-time course. Is there any difference on the quality  of the cert between a full time and part time course from NUS? How is NTU BTech degree differs from other computing part time degree from Private uni etc?

Lastly, what would be recommended for working adult to pursue a part time degree - BTech(computing) degree from NUS or BEng(Com science) course from NTU? Given that NTU emphasized that both full-time & part-time BEng cert are the same, hence it would be more recognized (in a way)?

1612,"Another NUS Architecture student here, building on what the previous guy posted. For those who do not know, the 'crit' format of our presentations, where everyone is required to pin up their work on a board for all to judge, breeds unhealthy competition and perpetuates the notion that 'whoever produced the most work, is the best student'.

And yes, we only have 5 laser cutters for everyone to fight over. Laser cutters are essential for producing good quality models in a shorter period of time, because a machine cuts for us, rather than we cut by hand. With such technology available, we are now expected to produce models of *that* machine standard, so laser cutters have become a necessity for us. With such shortage of lasercutters, many of us resort to lasercutting outside of school which typically charge us $50-60 per hour to use. Students who can afford such services are able to produce better work in a shorter time. Poorer students just have to suck thumb.

And yes, overnighting happens to many students from other faculties as well, but I hate that we have this toxic culture in architecture where overnighting becomes a source of 'bragging rights' for some of us, which makes the rest of us look 'lazy' in comparison because we did not overnight. If we perform badly for crit, we will also start doubting ourselves, like ""maybe if I overnighted for two more nights, I would have been able to produce what the tutors wanted.""

I am just upset that the school is obviously aware of this toxic culture, but is staying very silent about it. Worse still, many of the tutors are complicit in perpetuating this culture, and some even encourage it as proof of being passionate about architecture.

1613,"Hi I am the OP #71656: Thank you for your comments and suggestions. Just to answer some of your questions, I graduated from Life Science (BSc Hons) Merit. I am well aware that with hardly any work experience I would be considered as an entry level candidate (all temp, contract jobs - only one remotely related to the field I’m aiming for) expecting a high paying salary is not realistic and thus, I have always stated my expected salary as $2500 to $2800 (which I was told is an acceptable amount). 

The jobs I have applied to are mainly from the healthcare sector, I have sent out resumes to other sectors as well in desperation to land a job, ANY job. (Not sure if this is the right way to go about it but I’m losing hope). Job fairs I have attended a few with no callbacks whatsoever. With regards to feedback from interviews, I have sending emails to follow up on my interviews, in hopes of receiving feedbacks and bettering myself for subsequent interviews, however hardly anyone gets back to me after the “rejection notification” email. 

One major reject that I had was instead of during an internship or a FYP during my last year, I went with the options of doing modules to satisfy the credits. Have been contemplating on doing a Master’s/ Graduate Diploma, however, I do not have the financial means to do so at the moment. Thus, that will have to wait. Everyday going through the same old momentum of scowering through job portals and applying for jobs, without any callbacks is tough. I’ve heard that the job market has been bad but when will it change? 

The jobportals that I have been using are Careers@Gov, Jobstreet, JobCentral and or directly applying at the organisations’ page. If there are any other methods, I’d appreciate it if you could share. Thank you. 

For those who are in this same jobless predicament, hang in there, hang on to that tiny bit of hope. Have a nice day.

1614,"I have a friend who owes me a large sum of money (3 digits). It's been a year since I lent it to him and he still hasn't returned it. I gave him three reminders, and every time he says he has not enough money and will return next time. I really want to believe him, but he has a history of dishonesty, not just in money matters, but also in school and life (which I have also called him out for, but he repeatedly denies it and tells me to mind my own business).

Also, he relies on taxis all the time because he's always late, and has managed to travel overseas multiple times throughout the past year. And he spends a lot overseas. And he has an expensive smoking habit (like 1 pack a day). So I find it very unbelievable that he has no money to return back to me.

I have presented this evidence to him, but he always laughs it off and changes the subject. Once, I attempted to really grill him with the evidence and make sure he gives me a proper answer, and he suddenly got defensive and accused me of being so intrusive into his personal life. He painted himself as the ""better man"" who tries to solve conflicts amicably, while I was painted as the guy who always picks up a fight with him.

What can I do? 1) Should I continue to try and change his character as a good friend? 2) Will I ever see my money again?

1617,"Warning... read only when you have lots of time cos super long confession ahead!

I met a guy while on internship. He was cute, street smart with a great toned body, but very much attached,  so we kept our friendship on a professional level for some time. I just came out of a long term relationship then as well. However, I was frequently being hit upon by some disturbingly low EQ colleague and he would come to my rescue and glared him off.

Anyway, after remaining cordial for 2 months, we were both assigned to handle a project which involves lots of research and report writing. Hence we had to be constantly together during office time, and after work, we would frequently meet up to try and finish the work load.

During these times, we would inevitably talk about our own lives, and our aspirations etc. He was having some problems with his gf then, and he was unhappy as everytime he tries to leave, she would threaten suicide. I just listened looked at him empathically, but did nothing.

However my feelings for him grew stronger subconsciously.  Somehow I just waved it off cos you know, I didn’t want to be a third party. One day while in office, everyone else was out for meetings, and only the interns were left. We were typing out a report when I felt him stroking my head, longer than just a friendly pat. I didn’t know what to do. So I pretended that nothing is happening and carried on typing my report. But my heart was overflowing with emotions... how how???

Anyway, the bosses saw the project was progressing well, and gave us extra workload (and extra pay! Yay!) so we had to spend even more time together (yay?). Then one day, after collecting materials at the library, we went to his room to finish up the reports. I didn’t expect anything to happen, but he held me close, and kissed me. It was such a long passionate kiss, pent up from months of holding back. I was elated, but yet was extremely torn and guilt ridden. When the guilt overcame the happiness, I pulled away.  I asked him about his gf. What’s he to do? He sighed a very long sigh, and said he will try to settle and will think of a way.

I’m not sure whether he did sort things out with his gf, but I ended up being someone whom I never thought I would be. A “mistress”. I didn’t pester him to leave her as I was convinced that if I treated him well, he would see that I was the “better” choice! No one was married yet! Hence I cooked for him fancy meals, wiped his mouth after eating, patiently took care of  him while he was ill etc. I tried to be the best gf he could ever have. And he reciprocated  by buying me little gifts, suppers or just being there for me. He was really the sweetest guy I know.

It was the almost perfect relationship. I felt very loved, and we would talk about almost anything, except on when he’s going to break up with his gf. And it was tearing me apart. I would sob silent tears at night... for 2 whole years! My feelings never faded over these 2 years.

We were graduating soon, and i knew I cannot carry on this way. It would soon have to end. So I loved him and cared for him even more. And on the day I graduated, I wrote him a farewell letter. I thanked him for all these wonderful memories he gave me but since he was unable to make the choice, I made it for him. I told him to choose her, since all these while with me, I was unable to convince him that I was the better one. Maybe I wasn’t. Maybe she was really the better one for him. 

I then cut him off. Didn’t answer his messages or calls. And my heart bled. It bled so badly, but I couldn’t confide in my friends as none of them knew! I couldn’t tell others as they would say “serves you right” and it’s really serves me right. But I knew I made the right decision, and I would get out of this pain.

I did get out of the pain eventually. He went on to marry the gf. I was glad for him and I have also moved on. Perhaps life is made a bit more interesting with events that barge into your life suddenly, and leave you scars. But these are battle scars I can now look upon smiling while patting myself on the head for as long as I like saying “Well done Strong girl!” :)

The end.

1627,"Hellu, another NUS Architecture student here, come to share my opinions on this tsunami of a lifestyle we get swept up in. I don’t claim to speak for other Architecture students’ lives and thoughts on this, but I hope my two cents here goes a long way.
On my way home today, I saw an old man. He stood next to a swing for a long while, then sat on it and swung, having the time of his life. I thought to myself, “When was the last time I felt carefree enough to do that?”
As Archi students, our lives and minds are consumed by the work that we do, the never-ending “Project”. Even as I write this, I’m thinking, “How much time is this taking away from my design work?” We push aside issues that most would consider critical to functioning in human society, like politics, socialization, spirituality, and mental well-being just so that we can produce the best spaces for others to live their best lives in. Ironic, isn’t it, that the people who design for other people barely even live like people anymore. 
Some who read this may think, “Oh, these people are just complaining because they lack the rigor to succeed in this profession.” But I think deep down, even the most successful of architects have paid a deep price in their lives to be able to create for the human race. This doesn’t get better when we say to people,” Aki siong ah, wa die lah!”, “Aiya, Aki no life one la!” When we do this, we are trivializing the pains that we go through, turning it into a reputation and a twisted badge of honor to have “survived” Architecture, and people might just assume, after encountering this vicious self-denial we should be able to take this kind of pain forever.
Architects really do put a lot of thought into everything that they create, making damn sure that the people who use the spaces they create enjoy and benefit in ways they might not even realize. For all the non-Architecture students who see this post, the next time you walk into a building that you like going to, try to notice and think about what the architect might have done to make your life within comfortable, your experience enjoyable, and make you come back time after time, just because you “like the place”. For all the Archi students who happen to look up from your models and butter papers to see this, take a little break. Go for a run. Talk to a friend. Go have dinner. Write a weird rant essay like me. Remember to live. Remember you’re a person too.

Hey there! Im also a femme girl that is attracted to other femme girls. Except that i am also attracted to feminine guys (see KPOP guys kind of feminine) I just dislike masculinity in general, and absolutely hate it when guys just think about sex so often, or get aroused when we absolutely did nothing. Could be just me liking people with higher prenatal estrogen levels hahaha
But jokes aside, i had the same question as you, and was also afraid of coming out of the closet to others. Because im not attracted to butch girls, who based on stereotypes are usually 90% chance gay, you cant use stereotypes to detect other femme girls. So now without common stereotypes, i found that there were a few ways to find out.

1. You have to be close to the girl, then you slowly hint by asking if she likes any guy celebs or guys in general. If she doesn't seem interested or chose a few openly gay guys then there is a chance she is gay. Bonus points if she asks the same qns to you.
2. You try to lean on her shoulders or hug her (ofc not just randomly). If she does not pull away this does not mean she likes you (at least you know she doesnt hate you). If she hugs you back or leans in (good sign, but only if she isn't the touchy kind). If the girl is the touchy kind, this point is not a good measure to test her.
3. You brinig up LGBT related things, it could range from asking her what she thinks of pink dot, or if she went for pink dot before. Gauge her reaction, again this is tricky because she might just be an ally. But if you see her passionately or excitedly talking about it, high chance she is gay, not just an ally.
4. DEALBREAKER if the 3 criterias are met, ask her if she ever thought of being with a girl. BUT PLS you must be close to her AND meet the above 3 criterias positively, else this is gonna be a super awkward qns that will severe your friendship. If she says she has never thought but never showed disgust or reluctance, let her know that you have thought abt it. If she says she ever thought but never tried, tell her the same thing, when she knows she isnt alone, she'll probably reveal more, and maybe your friendship will be more than just friendship??

All the best and it'd be great knowing you though im from NTU and we'd probably never know each other

Another ex NUS architecture student here who would like to add on to the first point made. Have been to exchange, and together with opinions from other Singaporeans who have went to other countries to study Architecture, many commented about how ""Tutors in Singapore are competing with one another to see who gives more work"". I'm not pin pointing that ALL NUS architecture tutors like that, in my time I have had the blessed experience of amazing tutors who were not only open to diverse learning styles, but also encouraging and motivation considering that architecture is truthfully a grim industry.

Regarding the point made on depression, it's definitely true. Students who were once passionate suddenly wanting to quit the course, student dropping out halfway, the anxiety, panic attacks...it's all true but yet students can not afford to let it affect their production because the project is too important - it's either you produce something, pass and promote, or you fail it altogether and retake it a semester later. There's this unhealthy culture of students producing more work just for Tutor's validation, and peer pressure to just mindlessly produce quantity instead of quality defeats the whole point of nurturing creativity in the first place. 

Also heard from some seniors that feedbacks do not seem to have effect at all. Students who provided anonymous feedback on stress and depression caused from over work goes ignored, because certain tutors are important to the school's reputation. It still seems to be an issue, currently counseling a junior in Year 2 who reported that one third of his/her studio is suffering from depression under a certain tutor whom I guess is rather well known but I shall not name.

To the person who penned post #71862, I think it's a good thing to raise such awareness. No change can be brought about if nobody knows about such stuff, and things like these should not remain under the carpet for sure.

1. There are tutors who brag to other tutors that ""their students do not sleep"". What kind of teaching methodology is that? Are design students expected to be creative without basic ample rest? Many often say that NUS is not teaching architecture the way it's meant to be. Students always stressed to produce, but creativity isn't 24/7 you know?

2. Depression is real among students who cannot keep up. Yet it is often brushed off as a joke as ""nothing can be done about it"".  

3. The jump between year one and year two is absurd. Year one students barely learnt the basics, and year two students are suddenly assigned with a large scale project. Steep learning curve killed the passion of many potential students, got a feeling the year coordinators do not understand what students have learnt or are struggling with 

4. Current year 2-4 students have no fixed studio space to work on, only the small space at YIH. Not enough space for models to be left safely on the desk, and transportation often lead to models being spoilt. Expecting all students to have such a large table at home? no go.

5. Year 1 to master students have to fight over only 5 laser cutters in the past, now even fewer as some are reserved for ID students. Where are NUS funds being spent on?

1654,"Hey everyone, I am really at a loss in this relationship and I need your advice on how to move forward.

Let’s call him/her G. We have been together for a little more than a year. But it has not been smooth sailing. Back to the beginning, I met G while in my CCA. As time passed and we were practicing for our performance, I unknowingly fell for G. To find out more about G, I went to ask some of my mutual friends and their advice was that we are not suitable for each other. G was deemed as someone that is quite needy and needs much more attention and I’m considered to be the kind of person that is more independent and wants instead of needs in a relationship (idk how to explain also). 

Fast forward to after the performance, I was about to spend a semester overseas for exchange. At this point we are still not together but things were complicated where we went out on dates (guess we’re dating?) and flirted with each other quite a bit. But G is already quite possessive and does not like that there are two people that are opposite gender of mine in the group of friends i’m going on exchange with. I promised that I will not get too close with them even though i was close with one of them (Lets call him/her H. and H was a SA in a group where I was MGL). So off I went to my exchange and so the start of my hell (note that i was not together with G at that point). when my exchange started, G was behaving very bizarrely and getting upset at every little thing that i did. During the orientation party that my exchange school organised for all the exchange students, H got very drunk and could not get back to the dormitories on his/her own, other friends of that group were also not available because it’s either they went for second round or that he have to go back to the dorms earlier. So it was only H and me. The whole time our buddies and I only hold H until we reached the roadside and H just sat at the curb and fell asleep while i was looking everywhere for a cab while still making sure that H is safe. It was just entering spring and I have gave my coat to H so H will not catch a cold. I believe what I did was just being a good friend helping another friend out. But i was scolded and flared up upon by G for all the things i have done. Am i supposed to have left H there or what is another thing that i should have done because i really don’t know what i should have done.
Another time, the whole group of us went to get some street food and not wanting to spend too much money, the group decided to share some of the street food. In the end I shared my food (which is not even like a corn cob that kind where you have to “share” saliva with the other person) with H. I told G about this incident and even assured that nothing happened, yet I was bombarded with all the toxic scolding, it was like mental torture. I cannot really remember the exact things G said but I remembered that i was forced to keep my contacts with the two of them at the minimal. 
Then, there were even times where the whole group was deciding to go somewhere together but i just faked illness or tiredness to not go. Due to all these incidents, I have to cut all the contacts with H unless it’s for work or like formal stuff. Which i found ridiculous and like absurd. But in the end I obliged with it...  

Another thing happened during exchange that forever scarred me. While all the above were happening, G dares to say that G wants to go and meet with someone that G has a crush on. (I know, even i find it absurd when i read back what i typed). That incident ended with G saying it's his/her way of finding out whether he/she has feeling for me (like WTF). I was so sad when this happened that i went to a quiet place and cried while calling my close friend back in sg.

Another incident is that G went to visit a close friend at that person's hall (opposite gender) and the two of them drank in the room alone. Yet I am here having to cut my contacts with other people when I am hanging out in a group.

But i admit that i have done things that i promise i will keep my word but not kept my word. Things like keeping in contact with G as much as possible. Skyping G almost everyday for as long as i can. Im not saying that i dont want to do those things, but i dont think i should be scolded for not doing that sometimes, because of just how much i am already doing it.

By the end of the exchange, I realised i have only remember all the quarrels and scoldings and arguments and nothing much about the actual exchange. But i thought okay it will finally be over and yeah maybe G is just very sad that i go so far and for so long.

We eventually got together after I came back from exchange. But G started having issues with my other friends. particularly my closest friends from uni. In this group of friends, we are always without filters and always joke about very inappropriate things and thats how our group dynamic is, and we understand that what everyone in the group is joking about are just joking and no real intentions behind it. But G cannot take it and wants me to cut contact with those friends that i have hang out with since i started uni.
We already have a post graduation trip planned within the group and when i asked if i could bring G along, the group was not very fond of the idea because  they want the exchange to be with people they are really close with and because of what they have heard about G and how G treated me while i was on exchange. Again, the grad trip was a nightmare and much worse than what happened during the exchange. I was not happy at all during the trip, and many times i just stayed in the airbnb all day instead of going out with the rest, I hardly interacted with everyone and even when I went out with the group, I have to constantly take pictures to show that i am way behind and away from the group and not participating in the group conversation of whatever. I was in agony and it was the worst trip. 
Long story short, right now I have still not contacted them or met up with them since after graduation. 

G has always forced me through various ways that i am the one that f-ed up and G is the one that should the priority. I was made to make many promise about things that i dont even believe in if not the argument and quarrel will never end. I am so so sick of all these things happening. 

Right not, I have not contacted that group of friends. but recently I got interested in an activity and have been meeting around once a month with two other very very close friends of mine whom i knew from secondary school. Yet when i told G about this monthly meetup, G told me that it is a bit excessive to meet once a month. I was speechless. 

Another thing, I am currently working at a small company that hires quite a lot of interns. And when i tell G that i went for lunch with the interns, G will get so upset at me and ask me to go and have fun with them and dont talk to G. I am again at loss at work to do about . I am afraid that this will be problem that will just be there forever since i will have to work for another 20 to 30 years.

Another thing is that during my lunch, i am expected to reply G's messages straight away and must keep talking until my lunch is over, even if G is not replying me when i text. 

We are also have a lot of personality clashes such that G is always annoyed with the littlest things. I dont even remember what are the little things.

I am writing this long ass story because i am really really at a loss at what to do from here on. I really love G and I really hope things will become better but I am really feeling bleak on this. I hope the kind community here can give me some advice to steer me towards a decision instead of being stuck in this limbo now. 

TL;DR : Got together with someone, many problems, need help.

It's been merely 4 months. I'm in one of the halls, generally don't enjoy being around hall people. Conversations are pretty superficial and the people are just generally not in the same frequency. Came into uni with the goal of making just a handful of life-long friends. Incredibly grateful to have found a number of seriously quality people, I have so, so much fun with them, but realising that I need to step out and mingle too. That's but problem number one. What can I do to meet new people besides ccas?

Two, these few months allowed for superfluous amounts of time for me to think and get to know myself–as though I haven't done enough of that growing up, right? Well, I think I've come to the conclusion that I'm simply looking for a gentleman I can respect; one that's well-educated, sincere, and well brought-up. I've been in two relationships, of which the lack of drive and dream called for closure. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy dating people our age.

1666,"I have difficulties opening up to other people and I hope to seek some advice here. I am a guy and my personality is already introverted. I don't have much issue making small talk and acquaintances. However when I feel that the friendship becomes closer and more personal, I always feel uncomfortable and pull away. I just don't like people knowing too much about me or sharing too much personal info. Some people have complained that I always build walls around myself. It makes finding a close friend or relationship next to impossible for me. Is this normal and what can I do?

1668,"To OP of 71767, I was in the same situation as you before when i met my gf 5 years ago. She also have curfew had to be back home by latest by 1030pm, by 10 pm she's not home her mum will spam call her. Honestly speaking it sucks to have this curfew thing as both of us stay quite far from each other, 1 at west area and 1 at north-east area. We have alot of restriction due to the curfew such as no late night movie date and no staycation. We are also not allow to travel oversea for holiday as a couple even till now. 
During the courtship period we have arguments due to this issue and sometimes she brokedown and cried. But this doesn't stop us from being together, we tackle this issue together by planning our date to the smallest details and I make it a point to send her home every date/ outing, ensure she reach home before 10pm. Now I think back this continue for 3 years plus untill her parents started to know my existence and how I send her home everytime, even though we dont stay near each other. They started to be lenient by setting the curfew to 11~1130pm and lesser spam calls but I still make it a point to ensure she reach home by 10pm. Now we are engaged and getting married soon. 
Advice to OP relationship is not all sunshine and rainbow, most of the time is thunderstorm and it's not just you love me and I love you. It requires sacrifices, determination and communication from both parties. If you think she's the one for you take this curfew as a challenge, prove to her family curfew is nothing otherwise don’t waste each other time and move on. YOUTH IS PRECIOUS!!!

1670,"Dear prof ben,

Is it a red flag that my girlfriend doesn't know how to cook, lets her parents do her laundry and is lazy about chores or responsibilities that a responsible adult is supposed to do?


The thing is, she does not seem like the type that's irresponsible about life and all. Just that she justifies she'd rather spend time doing chores to making money to hire a maid. (To be fair at her current hourly rate that claim is justifiable) we haven't lived together yet. I'm not sure if this would be a problem in our relationship later on.

1672,"Recently, a guy who I did not contact for around 2 months suddenly asked me out for lunch. I did not know what to expect but I just agreed to go out with him. So during lunch, he shared a lot about his family, perceptions of situations, life goals and aspirations etc, and sort of showed me his vulnerable side like telling me his weaknesses. I felt that I really got to know him better after this meetup and he did mention that he really enjoyed the session together. I did enjoy the session too. However, now I do not know if I should still put any hopes on him, as I still feel a bit afraid that he will ghost me again like 2 months ago. I am trying very hard not to think too much if he actually likes me or takes me just as a friend, because I do not want to have too high hopes on how we will progress and then end up being ghosted and emotionally hurt again.

1673,"Coming to NUS has only made me realize how little I have achieved in my own life.

I've never been part of the typical NUS crowd, where a large majority come from well-to-do families, with an elite JC education. I took the long road to get here, which only compounds the fact that I struggle to feel like I belong here. Everyone around me seems to be achieving so much, but I myself, put in so much effort only to see how little I accomplish. Instagram and LinkedIn continue to torture me, because all I see is how others are performing so much better. They have great jobs/internships, a supportive partner, whilst I am left putting 100% in my work only to realize that I will never amount to my peers.
How do some people have it all? Is this what they mean when they say life is in unfair? I always thought that a person gets what he/she puts in, but I'm starting to think that it's a hopeless endeavour. When you're not academically gifted, you soon realize that trying to succeed is an impossible task. With a low CAP, you lose out at internships and jobs. I don't think anyone understands where I'm coming from, because they have never had to deal with such failure in their life. My friends have always told me to be happy and comfortable with my own journey, but how can you be satisfied when your reality tells you that you are the bottom of the social ladder?
My confidence and belief in myself have really taken a hit since enrolling into NUS. It’s a great environment to push yourself, but sadly, I think I will never amount to the calibre of some individuals here. How can I be proud of what I have accomplished (or lack thereof) when it’s plain and simple for the world to see that others are so much better?
Sorry if I'm sounding like an envious bitch, but really, I'm so jealous. I'm so tired and drained of pretending that I'm happy when deep down, all I can think about is how far I fall short of these standards and expectations. It hurts to know that you will never be good enough for some things in life, or even people.

I know you have been hinting to me for a while now, its pretty obvious and im not oblivious to it. I just cannot reciprocate it. From the extra attention and 'helpfulnenss' you've been offering me and no other girls from our clique to the moments where i was telling something to the others and you will cut in and ask about it - trying to get me to elaborate such that it becomes a conversation between us two. 4 months ago our clique talked about relationships and i said another guy liked me but i didn't like him back, i was surprised you remembered and asked me if i still talked to him, you must have thought that was a signal for you to express your feelings for me, but im sorry i dont like you that way either - and never will, because i cannot like guys that way. I know this is not a phase, and im learning to accept myself for being me so if you read this and this resonates with you, stop wasting your time on me, find someone else.

For the other guys out there, if a girl shows her lack of interest despite you showing obvious signs, take that as a rejection

However, recently from social media and Instagram many of her seniors and peers have either gotten engaged or has gotten married. However I've just entered the corporate world with a pretty good career going on for me and don't see us settling down anytime soon. I have my own condo fully financed so bto isn't a need for us.

But I've also told her directly that marriage is on the cards for sure but not anytime soon.

How do I approach this lightly and let her know my thoughts. We've had this conversation multiple times and both agreed (verbally) that we'll work things at a later stage eventually since our career are at its critical stage. Both of us are are in our mid 20s.

1678,"TLDR I’m a Y2 evergreen heterosexual guy, for quite some time now, I feel like I’m sexually attracted to women but emotionally attracted to men, and I’m not sure if this will be problematic, or is anything that should be fixed (because maybe it’s a sign of trauma or something).

I know I have no sexual attraction to men because I’m indeed only aroused by seeing women, not men. I’m not homophobic, I do recognise homosexuality as a sexual orientation (if I didn’t I wouldn’t even be discussing this topic, I want to know more). But what I do notice is when I develop feelings of romantic or emotional attraction with someone (“I really really want to be friends with this person/I really want this person in my life”), almost all the time it’s a guy (either straight or gay). And my brain seems to prioritise this emotional attraction over sexual attraction sometimes. Do note, I’m never “emotionally” attracted to the type of strong or macho men, it usually happens for people who are more in touch with their emotions and in my experience these guys really make good friends. Meanwhile sexual attraction-type crushes or eye candy happen with girls as they always have, but for a long time I have not met a girl I actually wanted to get to know or be friends with.

The strange thing is, granted this has happened very rarely but if a girl friend I consider “eye candy” is emotionally friendly to me, I suddenly stop finding them physically attractive, but I will still of course be emotionally in love with them and want them in my life. It’s like my brain has decided that a person’s emotional attractiveness and sexual attractiveness cannot coexist, and if a person is both emotionally and sexually attractive it somehow cancels out the sexual part. I suppose I might be bi, but it feels like a somewhat unusual form of bisexuality where emotional care and sex are on different ends of a binary.

I come from overseas and from a boys’ school so I don’t have any close girl friends in uni, only an entire bunch of guy friends. I don’t know if that has to do with anything, or which is the cause and which is the effect. Yeah in some sense I’m the stereotypical guy who has no girl friends, but for all I know it’s because my brain leads me to spend more energy pursuing friendships with guys? I have never clicked with a girl, much less felt any intense crush of wanting to be in a relationship with one (except next para).

In my life, I’m evergreen but had one experience of getting into a crush with a girl before my brain seemed to end up this way. It ended badly as a unrequited love/friendzoned story where my attraction (both emotional and physical at the time) was just used to take advantage of me, idk if that has any correlation either. I don’t experience trauma over it or feel bad about it, but I don’t know if it caused this change in me.

I’m concerned. Am I at risk of becoming like an incel, who sees girls as only sexual objects? If so, what can I do to avoid that happening - how much am I in a position to do? Is all this happening simply because my brain might have an emotional distrust of girls, perceiving them as unreliable friends or something, that I need to identify and fix? I don’t know if my lack of emotional attraction to girls is the result of suppressing it or I genuinely don’t feel any. And how can I ever get into a relationship if my brain seems to have decided that my emotional and sexual desires are to be fulfilled by different genders? It’s not really a life or death situation but just something really weird I wouldn’t dare to tell even my (guy) friends, lest they think I’m gay and attracted to them sexually, I might lose them too.

I have been through many things in life- tumultuous childhood, family problems, physical/emotional/sexual abuse, financial difficulties etc. Nevertheless, despite all the sufferings inflicted by others, I always believe in showing grace towards others. But recently, I am very bothered by the spirit of unforgiveness enshrouding this nation. Seriously, what in the world have we become? Nowadays, I abhor going online and reading all negative comments by bloodthirsty naysayers. It appears to me that we are regressing back to the medieval times where stoning and crucifixion are a common sight and I thought that we are a modern society. Shouldn’t there be more rehabilitative measures? One should not push others to the edge unless one is hoping that there will be more pathological suicide attacks. And if anything bad should happen, remember that you reap what you sow. Unforgiveness breeds a multiplicity of man-made disasters.

Honestly, I'm not very used to it since i was an ugly duckling before, but i guess puberty hit me like a N700S Shinkansen train. Some girls have even expressed interest in me and have asked me out before. 

But I have rejected every single one of them. 
Because frankly, I'm attracted to anime girls. 

When i was a younger, i was fat and ugly and socially awkward. Girls wouldn't even give me a second look. My romance life was practically non existent.  I found solace in anime girls. Admittedly, they gave me a false sense of affection (They can't reject you if they don't exist right?) and have been there to fill the void in my heart. 

Fast forward to the present day, i simply can not find a girl that makes me feel the same amount of love and affection towards my 2D waifus. It's not that i don't want top date a 3D girl , it's just that i feel like it's a downgrade in a sense?

1687,"I'm not sure what's wrong with me, but this problem has been bothering me since forever, secondary school iI suppose. And yall mus tbe wondering what problem I have. Well, it's just this super weird mentality. I can joke, diss, quarrel, hold hands with my mom on the streets and whatsoever with my family members but once they fall sick, or when things begin to fall lower than my expectations, I start to get a weird feeling.

For example, when they fall sick, I start to distance a way from them, regardless if it's my dad, mom or bro, but it's not that I'm scared that I'll start falling sick too. Or another example, when they cry in front of me, I'll just feel super awkward and try not to look into their direction. I don't know why, it just feels super weird to see my family members cry or fall sick that's a reason why I don't cry in front of people, unless of course when it cannot be controlled. I'm also hate letting others know that I'm sick whenever I fall ill so I'll just keep my mouth shut but due to the sudden personality change, people around me, including my friends, would discover it in no time. But it makes me feel like a weakling whenever any of that happens and I hate that feeling.

When my brother got into Pes E as he had a rare disease when he ws young, I sort of looked down on him too. I wanted him to be in commando or some cool squad. It just seems damn cool. Guys, chill, I'm not done yet, just in case you want to fire your comments on me.

I don't have all these problems with my friends though, it's just my dad, mom and bro. I don't look down on friends. Although when they are sick, I try not to expose them same as how I wouldn't want them to expose me when I'm sick, so I'll just act normal. Just to justify myself, I once lent my water bottle to my classmate on the first day or JC as she was coughing really badly, but I didn't drink from my bottle afterwards. Or when they cry, I don't judge them too. I really don't understand where did this mentality come from. As much as I want to change it, I can't. It's so difficult. I often admire how people can express their empathy towards family so easily but it just feels awkward for me. Help.

My gf's parents are super strict to the point that she still has a 10.30pm, max 11pm curfew despite being 26 yo and working. So for this reason, we never had sleepovers or supper date till today. We have also never gone overseas together before in the past 3 years.

- How do you get your employer to agree and approve your leave for your vacation plans (especially those that are longer than 2 weeks)? since usual companies only have a limited number of annual leave days. 
- How do you go on multiple vacations/trips per year without getting fired/ making your employer unhappy?
- How much of your salary (approx how many %) do you allocate as part of your travel budget?

1693,"To OP of 71717, 
I feel you. I too come from a family where I too feel that my parents were overprotective and I have never travelled overseas without my parents until the opportunity came up in NS as well. 
I would encourage you to go with the exercise as it really is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I too was happy that I got the opportunity to do so during my time in NS. While I framed it as an obligation to my parents then, I was more than happy to go for the detachment.
That being said, I think that as parents, they want the best of us and so they do not hope for us to come to any form of harm. So I think the best way to convince your parents is to assure them of your safety. The things you should tell them are: 

Firstly, you will be safe since you will be travelling in a group and that you will be looked out for by your fellow members of the group. 

Also, you will still be able to contact them to assure them of your safety. Not sure if your parents will demand that you call back or what but I think that it is still good to re-assure your parents by calling back every once in a while. However, you should make it clear that you may not be able to call back all the time or every day. 

You should also go and find out about a possible point of contact that your parents can contact you in case of emergency should anything happen back here. Each unit should have this number when they go for detachment. However, do make it clear to your parents that this is only for emergency uses. 

I think that more important than convincing your parents through reason, you should work on convincing your parents through action to show that you are ready to transition into someone that no need that much of their protection. For me, that meant helping out with some things in the household. 

Also, if you think about it, your going on a detachment could be further proof to your parents that you are no longer the kid that they think you were and who knows, probably they may relent on future instances where you need to go overseas. 

The thing is to get them to realise that you cannot be staying within the confines of their protection all the time. There will come a time where they need to let you go your way and they need to understand this as well. Give them time to be aware of this. 

Lastly, be patient and don’t think so negatively of your parents. I was once frustrated about how my parents were restrictive and at times felt suffocated (metaphorically) by them as well. 

However, I have since realised that the way every parent loves their children is different and learnt to focus on the positive things instead of the negative. After all, they are humans too and they too make mistakes. At each point in time, you are learning and growing and so are they. 

While I may not agree with them on certain things even till today, I am appreciative of all that they have done to raise me to who I am today. That does not mean that I have given up on the things that I do not agree with them on. I still try to voice my disagreements from time to time, but do it in a more respectful tone now. So stay strong and all the best????

I like having conversations but I feel like people are always talking about things that don't matter in life.

The issue is, most girls I met before, really only cared about guys or for some of my other girl friends, they preferred romance novels over hanging out with people, anytime of the day. When I start to be more openminded around girls (I hug people a lot) the more they start thinking I'm like a lesbian. I'm actually very straight. It's so restraining and confusing...

She and I are even planning to BTO once we start working and have our own financial means. She had quite a traumatic childhood and relationships. I do not want to elaborate on her childhood but it's something we would never wish on any child. She used to struggle with depression but went for counselling and gotten better. 

She has a history of harming herself whenever she perceives that she is at fault or punishes herself for some things. She doesn't do it as often and only does it whenever we argue where it ends up with her saying it's her fault. There are times when she says I am at fault too and I do agree on those and say my apologies. During those times, she never harms herself which I think it's because she doesn't have to 'punish' herself. 

I can't stop her from harming herself because she only tells me after she has done it. I don't know what to do and I feel hurt that she's doing that to herself but I feel so helpless and so sad. Would it be beter to end the relationship and let her learn to love herself more or should I stay? I'm at a loss

Of course you wouldn't know if you are considered hot by the general population. But you can try creating a dating profile and seeing if girls msg you. Guys always complain that dating apps dont work for them because they dont get much matches or girls do not message them. Actually that's not true, it is just not divided equally. Hot guys get alot more attention from girls compared to average looking guys. So if you get tonnes of matches and messages on dating apps, you know you are a hot commodity among girls. If someone say girls dont take the initative to text or reply, you know thats not true - because we do, if we find you attractive.

It was my birthday yesterday and he completely forgot about it until the day itself.

I feel like I should at least get a little angry or have a conversation about it but so far I've been acting nonchalant. What would you do?

“HIV infected persons develop antibodies to HIV antigens usually 6 weeks to 3 months after being infected. In some individuals, the test for the presence of these antigens may not be positive until 6 months or longer (although this would be considered unusual).”

Please note that even if you do the testing now it may not be accurate. Your might test might turn out to be negative as it takes time to develop. 

If your fwb’s circle of fwb has been tested to be HIV positive, please be ethical and stop your sexual activities for at least 2-3 months before testing again.

1702,"Would really need some advice. 

Some background story. My bf and I have been together for 8 years. Recently, he’s coming over to my house to stay during the weekends because my sis is away for exchange and I don’t feel safe with being alone with my mum. My dad works as a security guard so he works on a shift basis. 

There’s a history of my mom holding a chopper while we were sleeping about 2 years ago. My sister was with me. Since then, I’ve been having this image in my mind every time I sleep. 

She also discourages us having our own room. My bf tried so hard to paint the room, installed all my furniture for my sis and I so that we had our own rooms. Since then, things escalated. She claimed she couldn’t sleep at night. Things got better but my sis dropped a bomb to say she’s gg exchange (Aug 19-Jan20). Since Aug, she has been walking to my room while I was asleep. I heard footsteps so I woke up. And saw a shadow. I’ve looked at the timings, it can be 1am, 2am or even 5am! 

My bf stayed with me during the weekends and told me that he has seen my mom “patrolling” around my room. But the thing is, we’re really sleeping! We’re so worn out from work! My bf snores too so we decided to close the door so it doesn’t disturb my parents (my mom refuses to move into her bedroom, so she and my dad sleeps in living room). Just yesterday, my bf saw that my mom opened the room door at 1,2 and 3 am! 

It’s freaking me out, what do I do?

1707,"Recently I have been feeling kind of under the weather and unmotivated to keep on studying .

But it is not because I am struggling with my studies. In fact, far from it, I consider myself a ""straight A"" students: my results are exceptionally good (for someone like me); my peers look up to me; my parents are proud of me and I plan to keep on excelling academically as far as I am able to.

However the stress are taking on the toll and what with ever increasing workload causing sleepless nights (even more so when exams is near) have turned  me into a much more irritable person. My gf is quite understanding with my spending more time to studying than with her. However our communication have also been windling down a bit.

Penning all this down at 2 AM in the morning makes me feel depressed and question myself that actually what I am actually studying for.  Perhaps my being an academically strong student not because of any real purpose or objective, but I just find it a practical thing to follow since most of the school fees are self-funded, with some scholarship support. Still, at times I felt like whatever I did was not practical and I should be out pursueing something else more worthwhile. 

I hope I dont turn into those psychopaths.

I would like to read your take on the following rant, that a so called ethics ""professor"", at NUS spammed his students with just a while ago:
""Dear students

Some of you have complained that your ""friends"" who did not do any appeals are scoring better than you who did the appeals. And you think that's unfair. But you would be mistaken, because you're actually not seeing all the data. We, the teaching team, have that data.

In Week 13, we will show you the data. In the data, we will be able to show you that the students who have constantly gotten snapped, and worked hard to recover from those snaps through the appeals, are the ones currently at the top of the table (right now!). We can't fake these things, it's all in the data.

So, if you got snapped, but your score is the same or less than someone who did not get snapped, then, it is not because it is unfair, it is because you are not good enough. As we will show, the students who are good enough have gotten back more than anyone else, therefore they are at the top of the table. As they should be, because they are just that good, and shouldn't we reward students who have spent the effort, and have really gotten good?

The data always tells the story.

So, get good. Or not, your choice.""

dunno about you guys, but calling anyone ""not good enough"" because of a couple of assignments, seems unethical, unprofessional, and just plain crazy to me. this guy needs to take an ethics class himself, and then check himself into IMH.

1719,"I have been together with my gf (she's non-NUS; met her at a social gathering) for a few years now. Inevitably, the issue of getting our own house starts to crop up now and then. You see, she isn't exactly independent and is rather reliant on her family for many things. Lucky for her, her family is well to do and the community around their Balmoral condo gives her a sheltered but happy bubble to live in. She has made known her desire to stay near her parents after marriage many times.

Yet, I am of the more independent sort and would rather we live away from both of our parents. Even though both of our parents are rich enough to buy us a condo, I would rather we use our own money (not much on her part since her job isn't very high paying) and get a nice cosy BTO. Her parents agree with me, but my gf doesn't. When I told her about applying for the Bishan BTOs that were mentioned in the news this week, she kicked up a fuss about how that would be so far away from her friends living in Balmoral and Bukit Timah. She was also daunted by the prospect of leaving her current sheltered bubble, which was exactly the reason why her parents and I think we should get a BTO. After all, she isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer when it comes to dealing with people outside her sheltered bubble.

Needless to say, this housing issue is causing a strain in our relationship. She has also hinted that staying in a BTO is a line in the sand for her. After much persuasion, she was open to the idea of living in Bishan or somewhere equally convenient, but she insists on it being at least a condo. I love her very much, but I am afraid I am at my wits end dealing with her princess syndrome. Is there any way I can resolve this problem without jeopardising our relationship?

My results weren’t superb (& it was quite bad tbh) so whenever I applied for jobs that requires me to enter my University results, I would get eliminated even before I had the chance to go for an interview. I didn’t have the luxury of being a full time student. I need to work for my own allowances and school fees. But I know it’s not an excuse for not doing well.

On the outside, I seemed like a happy go lucky person but I guess no one will know how I truly feel. Doesn’t help when my family members keep asking me if I’ve gotten a job...... I am trying, really.

I had a friend who committed suicide recently because he couldn’t take adulthood. He lost it. When he landed his first job and he didn’t do well plus all the failed relationships he had along the way that sort of ruined him. Everything, literally everything just engulfed him at one shot. 

Don’t worry, I won’t give up on life. But I just want to shout to everyone who’s feeling down, disappointed or dejected - things will get better! It certainly will. Not now but eventually it will be better. Don’t give up on life. Think of your family, your friends and people whom you love. If you really feel like there’s no one worth living in the world for - live for yourself.

1722,"Hi I’d like to get some advice from you all. 

I’ll make it short. I’m a NUS alumnus. One of the (possibly) best things about my Uni life is meeting with this guy, who later became one of my close guy friends, whom I can confide in, especially when it comes to business, finance, relationship, life and stuff. Btw, we were from different faculties and we became friends after we first met for a CCA club. Later we found out on Facebook that we have quite a lot of mutual friends and our social circle is well connected. We had CCA meetings, gatherings, group outings, dance practices, and got closer to each other. We stayed in a NUS hostel (different blocks) and both enjoyed cooking. So, we didn’t run out of topics to text each other almost everyday during my year 1. We did more texting than meeting outside for just two of us. I could feel that he gradually showed some interest in me. Btw, I’m just an average looking lady but I think I’m sharp, hardworking, capable, kind, forward-thinking and very sociable. He is also smart, capable and average-looking (but I see him as a handsome guy). At times, he shared with me his past relationships. Maybe it was my mistake that I didn’t show him any obvious clues in return that I was also interested in him. 

So, he thought I didn’t like him and our texting became less frequent for a couple of months. We gave each other cold shoulders. Then I noticed he was chasing another younger girl and soon got into a relationship with her. We were still good friends but his then gf always speculated me and him whenever they quarrelled. To keep it short, they broke up after 2 or 3 years. (Disclaimer: the reason of their breakup was not related to me as I kept myself a distance from both of them. But he and I were still on talking terms as we had common activities.)

Some months later after his breakup, he texted me and we happened to catch up each other, and I could feel the same good old vibe being restored again. From that day on, we texted almost everyday though we were all occupied with our works and crazy schedules. Most of the things we talked about are no longer flirty, but rather sharing of each other’s life goals, career plans, family plans, finances and things that transformed us into mature individuals. Basically, both have turned into more capable individuals and started thinking about marriage — one of our common life goals. So, both are looking for a potential life partner to start a serious relationship with. He knows that I have some traits that make me wife material, and I also know that he is husband material. But we never talk it out directly to let each other know that we are the missing pieces for each other. We only show signals suggesting we can be a right match. 

So, the texting went on for a couple of months and I enjoyed it thoroughly. And just recently, I notice he’s become so caring towards me. He views my insta stories everyday and use them as a starter to chat with me. If he doesn’t initiate the conversation at our usual time due to his busy schedule, I then use his insta story to start chatting. 

Recently, he subtly hinted that we should meet up and catch up over dinner. So, we booked a date in advance for what both of us are available. 

Tbh, I’m in dilemma right now. Coz I’m not as hot as his ex-girlfriends, I want to know if he is really interested in me. If so, I’m ready to upgrade our relationship and go extra miles to fulfil each other’s goals. But if he is just flirting with me, I don’t want to waste my time for the wrong man. 

So, as a bystander, do u think he is interested in me? If so, in what ways should I deliver my signals that I’m also interested in him? Coz I heard that a guy tends to lose confidence and interest to pursue further if he doesn’t get any sign of assurance that the girl also likes him mutually. Btw, thank u in advance for any valuable advice ☺️

1738,"So I met this guy at a social event, and I got his number (he seemed really nice to talk to). We’ve been talking for a couple months now, and he told me about his future plans - currently studying in a private uni, only graduating in his early 30s. He seems really driven as well - working part time for his family business and doing part time uni.

Told my parents about him, and they felt that I should get with someone who’s from a uni like NUS/ NTU since it’s a norm to graduate from such a uni nowadays (in terms of job prospects, initial pay etc). Furthermore, he has plans of venturing into being a financial/ Property Agent after graduating, which does not provide basic financial security.

At this juncture, one part of me is saying: I shouldn’t judge someone’s worth/ future by the university they’ve graduated from; he’s really nice to speak to (for now); we have similar hobbies and we share the same outlook in life and relationships. 

But another part of me is saying: he’s gonna be quite old after graduating in 4 years time (early 30s), while I’ve already been working for a couple of years (I’ll be 28 by then). Our finances may not match and I don’t want to disappoint my parents for choosing someone who isn’t from a “good” uni since they have high standards for me. 

It’s 4 years down the road, I don’t know if I should spend the next 4 years waiting for him. Has anyone faced a similar situation?

1739,"Here is my take on relationships for guys. I’m no love guru or anything but just try it and it’ll work.
Part of it is psychology, really.

1. Attraction is not a choice. The very first time you see and talk to her, you’ll know if you’re interested in her and vice versa. She’ll know if she’s interested in you. If you’re interested but she’s not, there’s nothing much you can do. Attraction can’t be forced. 
2.  Get straight to the point and be confident. Ask her out for a date. Don’t just text back and forth. What you want is a relationship, not a phoneship. When she asks what do you want to eat, pick a date, time and place. Don’t reply “Oh I don’t know, what do you like to eat?” She wants you to decide. So be direct and decisive. Never accept a “maybe” date. If she says maybe, tell her to figure out her schedule and get back to you. Don’t ask her a second time. She’ll contact you if she’s interested.  
3. Ask questions and build rapport. It shows that you’re interested in her, and she’ll know. Women are not dumb. They’ll know if you like them or not. Asking questions will let her know that you’re genuinely interested in her or not.  
4. After the first date, don’t ask her out for the next date straight away. To them, it shows that you’re needy and you got no options. Contact her maybe 3 days later and ask her out again. You may want to go out minimum once a week. Indirectly telling her you have things going on other than being crazy. (It’s psychology). 
5. Don’t text her often. Honestly, this is the most common mistake. Many guys go on texting through night and day, calling her on the phone and chatting for hours. Again, it’s a relationship you want, not a phoneship. Reply to her texts minimally and set a date. If she texts you, initiate a date. She won’t miss you if you keep blowing up her phone with texts and calls. How can you miss someone if they’re constantly in your face? Again, it’s psychology. 
6. When do you tell your feelings for her or know that she’s interested in you? Listen to her. There are signs. If she “accidentally” bumps into you, it means she’s feeling comfortable with you and doesn’t mind getting closer to you.  But just don’t say “I love you” first. Let her say it. And then you reciprocate.  
7. When is the best time to ask her for an official relationship? Well, look for signs again. She’ll ask, “Where is this going?”. Well, don’t answer by saying “Oh you want a relationship?” Ask her back. Ask her, “ what do you mean ?” And then she’ll elaborate further. Again, ask her questions. Let her elaborate further. She might go along the lines with “We’ve been going out for awhile and I’m just wondering what’s our status.”  Then you’ll know what’s up. 
8. Don’t ask her about her past relationships. Whatever happened in her life doesn’t concern you. She’s going out with you and that’s it. When you ask about her past relationships or ask if she like someone else, you’re telling her you got no value. “Oh, you dated someone better than me? I hope I meet your standards, etc.”  
9. Don’t go telling her about your life story. Always ask her questions. Women like men who are mysterious. It’s like watching a movie and there’s a cliffhanger. They like the anticipation and finding out what you’re all about. If you tell her your whole life story, there’s nothing much for her to discover. 
10. If there are times that she doesn’t reply to you as frequently as before, it tells me that you’re constantly chasing her. I can’t stress this enough, women are like cats. They come and go as they please. If you’re constantly texting her, she’ll get bored. Stop texting her. If she likes you, she’ll come back.  
11. Never argue with a woman. There’s a reason why people say “Women are always right.” When you argue with a woman, it means you don’t understand them. Don’t even bother to reason with them.  
12. Women will ALWAYS test you. ALWAYS. From the the courtship to the relationship phase. Trust me, even if they say they don’t, they do. They’ll purposely make you mad to see if you get mad. Or whatever means to tick you off. Even not replying you for awhile just to see if you’re needy. But that’s just women. Don’t ever get mad. Just play it cool and don’t take things personally. 
13. When she’s mad. She’ll test you. When you ask her to talk , she’ll say “No, I don’t wanna talk about it. I’m not angry at all. There’s no point in talking.” It’s her way of testing if you truly care about her. Dig in deeper, make her laugh. Always use humour. Joke and banter with her till you she says why.  Don’t bother reasoning out with her why she’s wrong during this phase. Just make her laugh and she’ll feel way better. 
14.  Reference to step 13. Be wary of women who stonewall you. These are the people with attitude and are red flags. Whatever ways you tried to joke with her and make her talk but she still refuses to talk. It’s a huge red flag. Imo, they are manipulative as hell.  
15. Once you guys are together, then you can slowly tell her your life story. But do it with a positive spin to it. Example, sharing with her about your past girlfriend,” Oh i broke up with her because she was a egoistic, manipulative, self-centred bitch.” It’ll come as a turn off. Do it with a positive spin for example, “It was pretty unfortunate but I’ve learnt a lot during the past relationship. We just weren’t compatible.” Simple as that :) 
16. Don’t go around pleasing a woman. Please. Don’t drop what you’re doing just to please her. If she’s mad with you for not returning texts immediately and start doing it, trust me, she’ll stop returning your texts after awhile. Have a backbone. Continue with your purpose. Having a purpose is what attracts them actually.  This is as much as I can think of for now. Final tip, don’t chase women. Have them chase you. You just have to chase them during the first 3 dates. Initiate texts and asking out for dates. After that, she’ll text you, wondering if you’re interested in her, and then you can ask her out on a date.  Those romantic films you watch, where you gotta buy her flowers, do all the romantic things and hope one day she’ll fall in love. They don’t work in real life. Never buy her gifts unless she’s your girlfriend.  You don’t see men like James Bond chasing women with flowers etc. Be confident, maintain eye contact and engage in a genuine conversation. Get to know her more. Most part of it is just psychology. That’s why most women go after “ bad boys “ and not the “ nice guys “. This is it. If there are 9 men chasing her with flowers and you just act cool with the tips, she’ll probably blow the other 9 guys off. Many women will disagree on this but this what they’re naturally attracted to. Good luck ;)

She’s always blaming someone else for her own mistakes, second guessing other people’s motives when they’re nice to her, calculative with money and verbally abusive. Since young, whenever we have disagreements, she’ll never be able to reason nicely like other parents. Instead she’ll say things like “regret giving birth to you”, “go and die”, “you’re ugly” etc. If she weren’t my mother I wouldn’t want to have anything to do with her.

1742,"Today, I felt my heart properly break for the first time. The course I’m studying has quite a heavy workload so I haven’t been going home for the past three weeks. My father came to visit me today. He is rarely ever free and today is one of those days that he could make time. 

My father is close to 70 years old and he is still not retired. He works as a cleaner at a country club during the day and holds another cleaning job at the community centre near my house at night. For some reason, he had half a day off today and he said he wanted to tour my hall. He came over and after showing him my room, we decided to get dinner at the Kopitiam at Kent Ridge MRT. 

I know my father doesn’t have money so I offered to pay for his dinner. Guess what? The silly man ordered the cheapest thing he could find - fishball noodles. There was a lady (very well dressed, looks to be at least middle-class) infront of us in the queue and she left her chilli on the counter then walked away somewhere. My father didn’t see it and thought that that was an extra sauce so he just took it and put in on our tray. When the lady returned, she said very sarcastically that someone took her chilli while glancing up and down at my father. He immediately apologised and explained to her that we were not aware and that she could have her chilli back but she replied “你动过的我才不要。安葬死”, which loosely translates into “I don’t want what you’ve touched. You’re dirty to death”. 

This was when I realised that my father was still in his uniform. I almost screamed at this lady seeing as she was clearly younger than my father and was being rude. However, my father held me back and simply apologised again. He said that he’s used to it and it suddenly hit me that this is what he does all on a day to day basis. He apologises and lets people walk over him. He is invisible. I always knew my dad worked hard and is always at the mercy of others but seeing it with my own two eyes was an entirely different experience. I couldn’t even hold back my emotions and start tearing uncontrollably while we were eating. I had to lie that I was tearing because I got chilli in my eye but the truth is I was heartbroken by how my dad has to swallow his pride all the time. 

I can’t wait for the day when I can tell him to stop working and stop apologising for everything. All my dad ever did was love and dote on me but everyone else has just been so awful to him. Dear rich people, what did we ever do wrong to you?

My job search has been taking 2 years and I have yet to still find a full-time job. I'm a NUS graduate with a BscHons. I have attended quite a number of interviews (~20) over the course of the two years and got rejected by all but one - a 3 month contract role (in 2018).

I have been constantly actively seeking for jobs and taking courses online to better myself and my skillsets, helping out with the family's business and doing temp one-day event roles to earn some pocket money on the side during that time. However, it is hard to explain the one year unemployment gap in my resume (since the contract role in 2018). I don't have much work experience prior to graduation as well. I having sending out resumes on a daily basis, with only a few companies getting back to me (1-2 companies). 

I have been trying to keep myself sane and hold on to hope that a job offer will eventually come by but it's hard. It doesn't help that almost everyone around me are landing jobs and as much as I don't want to compare myself with them, I can't help but question myself: what am I doing with my life. Is it supposed to be that hard to land a job? I am at a lost of what I should do. Please help. Any help or advice would be kindly appreciated. Thank you.

Even when I am running late for lessons, I would forgo the ISB and instead speed walk to my class via the least busy route in an attempt to minimise human contact. I would also switch off my phone and ignore all messages because the thought of interacting with human online makes me equally nervous.

In the past, this irrational fear only flares up once every 2 to 3 months, and each episode usually lasts for no longer than 2 to 3 hours, so I would normally just dismiss it as a strange and random habit of mine. Worryingly, this 'habit' has been flaring up at an unprecedented frequency and intensity in recent weeks. I experience it once per week, each time lasting up to 12 hours. I even skipped my CCA a few times in the past few weeks reporting that I was sick, but I was actually just panicking and hyperventilating in my room because the thought of having to see and talk to other human beings was just too nerve-wrecking and inexplicably unbearable for me at that moment.

I dare say im on verge of mild depression (i have anxiety going to work) and just counting down to finally being able to leave.  IS it bad to be this picky as fresh grad?

1776,"I really need some advice here. No troll comments, please.

This girl and I met during camp. She had a bf then, but we still texted and met quite often. One day, I confessed to her and she broke down. She felt happier with me and had feelings for me. But what was holding her back from her ex was time(they were together for 2years). To be honest, I was prepared to leave because I dont want to be a third party. 
For the next 2 months, we spent almost every day together(except Saturday and Sunday). The time we spent together, we did share intimate moments(kiss, hugs etc). When she was sick, I would buy medication for her. I would also often buy her favourite food etc. Even when we eat out, I would often pay for our meal. During these 9 weeks, she eventually broke up with her bf. 
So, after 1 weekend, everything changed. Her replies got slower(this was not the same week she broke up with her bf). We had a lot of quarrels about texting etc. She didn’t care as much. There were a lot of red flags, but I chose to believe what she told me. Another week past and I went to find her (she stays in school). The usual bought her favourite food etc, hoping to surprise her. I was in her room for about 40minutes (which she knew cause I texted her) before she came back from her friend’s room. I confronted her about the whole situation and if she liked someone else. After much hesitation, she said yes. My heart sank.  
Till now, I still cannot comprehend the situation. How can someone change of heart so fast? After all the vulnerable moments we shared together. She barely knew the guy, but she already chose to forget everything that happened? I had so many plans; her birthday, after exams etc. But I guess it’s all a waste now. 
I know that time will heal everything but as of now, thoughts of suicidal are constantly in my mind, especially since I know she is enjoying her time with him. After everything that happened, I just feel like I was being used. I tried distracting myself by studying but I cant concentrate. I often skip meals these days cause I just don’t have the appetite. Sometimes I feel like being the nice guy doesn’t get you girls.

1777,"My parents got divorced some time ago. I have never told anyone about this, not even my closest friends or even girlfriend. 

I realized that I have been thinking a lot about it recently, until sometimes I tear up and cry myself to sleep. I really feel so helpless, more so imagining if my future relationship will end up the same way. If a marriage of 30+ years is able to disappear just like that, what is permanent? 

This is really a bad time, as finals is soon and I have to make my FYP submission. I have considered going to UHC for an appointment but I don't know if their advice would be effective. I believe that it is partly my fault, regardless of what online self help articles claim (that divorce is never the fault of children). 

I do not think its fair to my girlfriend too, that this episode is causeing me to have doubts and reservations. 

I believe that the siblings of one of my parents was another factor, they have always disliked my other parent and have hence been secretly wishing for the divorce. I am quite sure they were encouraging and supporting the divorce. If It is taking a lot of willpower not to write a strongly worded letter to those cunts, telling them how shitty their behavior is and that there is a special place in hell reserved for such cunts and assholes. They claim to be such devout and religious people, I wanted to once write a letter to their place of worship explainig how hypocritical they are

This is seriously the worst feeling anyone can feel, and I do not wish this upon anyone. Every night before sleeping is really the worst time, lying on bed thinking of how I could have saved the marriage.

1779,"First of all, I want to say that I really like Singapore,but I have some impartial observations to put forward. As a follow up to a previous post, I just wanted to say that I was very surprised with Singaporeans. I've been in different parts of Asia and usually really like the people, but here is different. Some people are so rude! In some stores you say hello and they don't even answer, no thank you either. This has happened more times in a few months here than ever before for me. In class, students constantly arrive late and leave early, talk and eat loudly, sleep right in front of the professor. Some will snort extremely loudly for one hour! I mean just go blow your nose... I don't know if this is a cultural clash or if i've been very unlucky. I've of course met some nice locals, but the whole culture seems a little bit oppressive. A lot of people will blindly follow orders/instructions even when it literally makes no sense. And everything here is always about work! Students do sports because they think it will look good on their CV, they always talk about school. When you go to nightclubs the locals usually don't even dance, they just go to buy bottles and show off. Even the relationships here sound transactional (why are Singaporeans so obsessed with concepts like FWBs?).
Anyway, to sum up, you guys are obviously very organized and hard-working but you could gain a lot (especially for mental health) by working on creativity, relaxation and spontaneity. 
Once again I've met some wonderful people here, and I genuinely wonder if some locals agree with me.

I have read that contract staff in Google are treated differently, restricted from accessing certain data, attending certain meetings and/or townhalls.

1790,"This is not a troll post, I really need some advice here. 
Background: My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 years. He has been in and out of jobs for the past 6 years. I’ve been the one supporting him whenever he’s out of job. I didn’t mind being the one supporting him because couples go through thick and thin, right? 

What happened: Lately, I noticed that we are quarrelling quite a fair bit. And whenever we quarrel, it escalated to something more verbal. We quarreled a lot but not to this extent. He’d shut down and not pick up my calls, not reason things out like how he would normally do. 
Last month, I wanted to be more intimate with my boyfriend. I might have come off as too “pushy” because he was too tired. I apologized for that. I did explain to him that it was because I don’t take initiative because I was shy and due to my past of being molested. So when I want to take initiative, my whole brain is just thinking about it and I neglected the part that he was tired. He then put it on that because the previous day we spent it with my group of friends. That’s why he was tired. He then said that he didn’t want to go on a trip with my friends because of this. (We resolved this already at that time). 

Last Saturday, as we were booking our flights to Australia. I said to him, why not you book the flights, I’ve been booking and paying for the hotels that we went for the past few times already. He agreed. But soon, he got angry when the prices of the air tickets increased. He kept complaining that it was because it is December (I’m an educator, that’s why I could only go during Dec). Then he started hurling vulgarities. And he didn’t want to pick up my calls and now he said again, he didn’t want to go on a trip with my friends. 

I don’t understand what is going on, I feel that if the ticket prices are too expensive, I don’t mind forking out. But it is as though like he is blaming me for it and every time we quarrel, it always ends off with, “I don’t want to go on a trip with your friends.” Like, isn’t this a separate issue? I feel that if planning for a trip only it’s like this, I don’t know how to move forward.

Sometimes I wonder if you ever felt walking away was a mistake. We cared for one another and loved another deeply, albeit through vastly different forms. I can confidently say we still love one another, but perhaps in a more mellow, subtle, distant manner now. 

Sometimes it's tougher to get over someone when there was no dramatic ending - no cheating, no falling out of love. Rather, a clash in personalities and perhaps life goals and timing. Anyhow, hope you've been well, love. Stay healthy and happy, please. That's my greatest wish for you. xx.

1795,"I met this charismatic guy back then. He always knew the right words to say, be it to advise, to comfort, or to reassure me. Perhaps it was because he is a lot older than I am.

I fell in love, and so did he. He was straightforward when confessing his feelings, and I was blown off my feet not knowing what to expect in my first relationship; because of our age gap we hid our relationship. We could only meet in his home, or drive around aimlessly, & what else can you do in these places....

This went on for a year until i found out that i was a third party. I was shocked, and betrayed, but mostly found fault in myself for being so gullible to a man’s sweet talk.  

I avoided him for weeks but my determination to stay away wavered as he confessed that he was out of love with her - and only stayed due to her suicidal tendencies. Well, who am i to stop someone in a situation like this? Yet my heart still longs for him. 

It didn’t help that we still met occasionally due to mutual friends. In the silence and distance, i would still grab his hand whenever he holds it out to me. A cycle of attraction, guilt and heartbreak - at least for me. 

At the back of my mind, i was always suspicious of his real intentions. Was he lying to me? Was i being used? How many more secret relationships is he hiding?

Eventually i couldn’t take this overthinking and completely shut him off my life - even after a year, when he reached out to say he has finally been freed from his relationship. 

Not long after, our mutual friends told me that he wasn’t ok, almost depressed even, and they didn’t know why. All this while, i didn’t dare believe that it was because i left - because he had so much going on for him, and i really didn’t feel like i was much of a priority in his busy schedule. 

This all happened a few years back. I’ve mostly moved on but once in a blue moon, certain events still trigger memories and erupt unpleasant uncertainties in myself. I guess i never got the closure i needed, nor know for sure if my first love was an unfortunate love story or a miserable lie. Maybe the worst part is, i could never breathe a word about this to anyone i know. 

I have zero intent of getting back together, yet i don’t know why this bugs me so much... genuine thoughts & advice appreciated.

I feel like my sister is the one pulling the strings. My parents favour her more and would even seek advice from her. She would always try to put me in a bad image and talk as if she’s great in front of my parents. I don’t know why she’s doing this but recently she has been talking about BTO and hinting my parents to pay for her, so maybe that’s why. Once she asked me what I thought about her fiancé and I asked her why. She said it’s because he will become a part of the family in the future and have a bigger standing (my sister is older than me) than me and my girlfriend. 

Honestly I couldn’t take it anymore a few months back and have tried to avoid contact with them. Me treating them well will only backfire. I would give them 1 word replies and no longer buy stuff for them or bring them out. My mom is the only one who cares about me and asked me why I changed but I didn’t tell her. I think my father and sister noticed but they haven’t done anything. So far I feel that it’s better this way for my mental health. But I have a bad feeling that my sister have ‘won’ and this might have been what she wanted.

All my life my experiences with the opposite gender have been very limited, like I can literally count with one hand the number of girls who were at any one point friends with me (my hand has 5 fingers if you were wondering). It's probably cos I have always been in male-dominated environments and also because I am too shy to even interact properly, even with guys. So I guess that's how unrealistic fantasies about girls have developed. It certainly doesn't help that I think girls are some of the most beautiful things on the planet. In school, I always get uncontrollable urges to stare at girls, simply because they have such beautiful faces/figures/legs/skin/etc. I also really wanted to join those telegram groups like SG nasi lemak cos i have so much pent up horniness, and the only reason i didn't was cos I didn't want to reveal my identity to anyone in those groups. Only after the outcry about sg nasi lemak did I start to wake up my idea and realise my thoughts may be quite unhealthy. 

So yeah i think i need some help to stop being obsessed with girls. I'm quite scared that i might be the next nus student appearing on the news for you know what. How do i treat girls as normal people, and how do i establish healthy relationships (friendships for now) with girls?

1812,"I just don't really get the concept of modern dating. Especially with the emergence of online dating apps, there are just too many options and many people are dating more than 1 person at any one time. 
Having gotten out of a few bad relationships in the past, I went to on to experiment with online dating apps, thinking that maybe dating / talking to a few people at a time would be kind of fun and would allow me to form better judgements since I would not be blinded to only one person that may be a bad fit. However, eventually I decided that the concept of ""dating a few people at once"" doesn't sit well with me. I don't get how is that will work out cause I think it gives the illusion that you have so many other backup options that you needn't put in much effort in any one of them? And it eliminates the fear of failure?
So I deleted the app after finding one guy that I decided to focus on. We went on a few dates and we do like each other, though we are both not ready and not sure enough to commit for a serious relationship yet. But the problem is, even though I am dating him exclusively, he is dating a couple of others because he too, had a couple of bad relationships in the past and now he is not sure of what he wants yet and doesn't want to settle down easily. I understand what he means because it makes logical sense but I couldn't help feeling upset that I am not the only one he is dating. It's like I am feeling special at one moment, but the feeling disappeared and was replaced with a heartache when I  remembered the fact that I am not the only one! 
I am having so many inner conflicts between my heart and my mind now. Should I stick around with him and date other people too (I mean that's practical right?) Should I continue dating him exclusively, give my best shot to it and accept it if it doesn't work out in the end, or just drop it and find somebody else who is willing to focus on only me and give me a shot?
I really think that this modern dating world is kind of screwed up. People nowadays are getting more picky and afraid of commitment to the extent that it's so difficult to find a partner now, isn't it? Or maybe I am the delusional one who is willing to put myself out there to get hurt.

Also to jump on the meme bandwagon, I won't be able to get away with outrage of modesty, so there's that.

1818,"Hello everyone. I'm a girl and...

I have a HUGE problem. I am constantly horny and I can't handle my urges that well.

So I am in a 1 year relationship with my boyfriend. He is a nice guy, gives me attention as much as he can, because he is working most of the time, I would then go on and hang out with my friends a lot. Didn't help that most of my friends are guys. I used to cheat on a former 2 year ex with many other guys and I never felt bad or guilty about it until I talked things out with him but you know, i moved on real quick without issues.

My ex at that time was manipulative although loving but i didn't want to continue being with him. Fortunately, managed to break things off with him.

So back to my 1 year relationship, i almost cheated on him with some other people but i really held back because this time I thought maybe I will indeed feel guilty so better not cheat.

But then I still feel like cheating because it's what I had been doing all this time. I feel like shit. What do I do?

Also, I feel like it's not fair for my boyfriend just cos I have a shitty reason such as BEING HORNY.

1819,"I met S. in our first year at faculty orientation and we hit it off really well from the start. I never thought of myself as a 'love at first sight' kinda person but we locked eyes and just knew. Immediately. The most memorable moment was when there was a night when everyone else was distracted doing something and we sneaked off to lie on a field together looking at the stars.

Since then it has been four great years. We both recently graduated this May and have just about embarked on our careers now. Of course with beginning real adult life comes all the usual considerations about moving in together, how and when to start a family given our circumstances, where to have our wedding outside of Singapore, etc.

I guess the honeymoon period is over of course and now is the time when real considerations take over. Like S. is Muslim and I'm Catholic, so any kids we are able to raise eventually we'll have to think hard about how to educate them on religion. We both also have different countries in mind that we want to emigrate our to-be family to eventually...we'v'e debated this for years and argued about it many times with no conclusion.

I really love him but lately it just seems like all these problems are stacking up one after another. I think the biggest wedge issue at the moment is that he really wants me to convert to his faith. I've not been super devout in recent years (long story) and I'm almost willing to convert just to be with him, because he means that much to me. There's just one problem: I'd have to cut my manhood. You know as it's sort of part of the rules. And I'm not sure if I can through with all that, and how much compromise I'm willing to make. Compromise after compromise until when?

There was once my father saw a credit card transaction from amazon that he did not do. So he asked me seriously if I was the one who used his card without his permission. I said no but he still doubted me. In the end it was an unauthorised use by some scammers so the card was canceled. Another time I bought snacks from overseas for my family but they were not happy with me because they didn’t like it. He would call me useless from time to time for minors things too. 

Once I bought shirts and shoes from e-mart for my parents. Then my sister said to me in front of everyone that it wasn’t my own money. Another time my gf put her showering stuff in my house and my sister scolded me like mad saying she shouldn’t do that. Another time I left some food for my parents and sister after eating dinner (home cooked) and my sister scolded me for being lazy to wash the plates.

As someone who values their privacy & freedom I'm not on social media but it seems like one gets completely cut off from any happenings or social circle. Singaporeans are such a reserved,constantly irritated and boring lot. They dont even bother to say hi to their neighbours. The Chinese are busy studying all the time and happy with not being integrated. Most girls(any ethnicity) are so meek they'd rather drown in their own ocean of fear than take the risk of approaching someone they like. Going out to clubs or tinder is so passe and a loser's game for a guy and organizing events constantly requires some or the other permission. A movie night at utown requires a licence! Flat parties are only held by the exchangers because everyone else is too afraid or busy on instagram. No one has any fun here! Pff, singapore is BORING! Would never recommend anyone to come here unless all they want from life is endless shopping malls and banal simple-minded consumerist pleasures.

1827,"Just curious about inter faith relationships hoping that you guys can advise better. 
I have found a potential partner of a certain religion that strongly encourages them to find someone of the same religion. Is it really a must to convert even when you already have a religion... it feels like even though they say it is optional but strongly encouraged, in the end I will probably be psycho to join them. The worst part is I know even if I do convert the intention is just to please him,  I will not wholeheartedly believe in the religion and it will be really pointless. from what I gathered through my friends, they have been reminded regularly by religious texts to find partners of the same religion. I have heard them say a marriage between people with different religion is less likely to work out as they have more things to argue... whilst that may be true, I feel that the anticipation of the argument is likely to cause real arguments to happen which may eventually lead to breakup or divorce... 
anyway does anyone has any good advice to make it work although I honestly see very little hope down this road...

1839,"Hi fellow peers, there's something that I'm a little curious and maybe slightly bothered about. So a little context here: I am a lesbian and I have a close heterosexual male friend who has a very jovial and friendly personality whom I hang out and chat with often. He knows I'm not interested in guys, but have expressed that he has found me cute and calls me babe or cutie sometimes. I'm inclined to believe it's just his personality and how he gets close to people easily (with both guys are girls). Some of the stuff he says could be interpreted as a little suggestive, like dirty jokes and stuff. But is that normal because I'm like a ""bro""? I can't pinpoint what, but I get the impression that he thinks he can make me straight or bring out the feminity in me sometimes. 

He also has a strong gym body and is proud about it and gives off the alpha male vibe as well, which I don't think very well of because I think it's really egoistic to feel attracted to girls whom you can dominate and lose interest in girls when they are capable enough to surpass you. One of the dominant moves I felt from him is his habit of giving the back of my neck a squeeze (I've never seen him do it to anyone else) every now and then. I do try to avoid physical contact from him, but only when I can do it without being obvious because I don't want him to think I see him as some predator. Another thing is that he comments on some of the things I do as cute (I find that annoying because it's really like calling the things I do for the goals and causes I really believe in to be kiddy). He's also the kind whose ideal type is someone he can show care and protection to, and I don't like the idea that he might see me as his type because I see myself as rather independent and have ambitious goals. Like omg, even if I like guys, I won't want to limit myself to strive for my ambitions less just so as to be careful not to make you seem less like a man around me; that mentality irks me. Nevertheless, we are good friends as I don't think some disagreement with how we think should make us enemies as we do get along mostly and he's been a really helpful senior. I ever thought that if I show that I can be a more capable person than him, I could see if his perspective of me could change. But ambitious as I am, he is a really capable guy with good grades and future prospects and I don't see myself outshining his achievements anytime soon if ever. 

Ok, sorry for the long context. So anyway, recently, we went to the gym together and he tagged me in an instastory doing some exercise (with only my ig handle and no other text). When we both went home, he showed me a screenshot of his instastory statistics (I think it's only available if you register your Instagram profile as a business account) which showed that I have a few dozen sticker clicks on my Instagram handle, showing me how so many people were ""interested in me"". There was also 1 share, which I inquired about but he didn't address it when it got buried under another conversation we were having. A few hours later, he then sent me an update showing how the number of clicks on my Instagram handle has gone up by about another dozen. I do see myself as a rather open-minded person, and think it's natural to compliment me on my looks if they appeal to him. I am proud of my physique and fitness after all (I'm not the massive kind, just the lean muscle kind of person who does mostly calisthenics). I do feel kind of bothered somehow though, but I'm not sure if it's because I'd never posted about my gym sessions or ever do selfies myself, or whether it's something else. I never did express any objection when we filmed me on his instastory though, so I can't blame him for anything.

Anyway, that's the end of my story guys. Thanks for reading. Some of the thoughts that have gone through my head are: ""Is he interested in me and believes I can somehow 'awaken' my interest in guys one day? Or is he just super friendly?"", ""Is there any meaning behind him scruffing my neck and cracking dirty jokes with me? Should I be allowing it to continue? I haven't heard anything misogynistic so far and can live with it if there's no harm done."", ""Am I bothered because I don't think well of the alpha male mentality, or because I feel objectified somehow or treated like a child somehow?"", ""What the hell does scruffing someone's neck even mean? I've never seen anyone do that to anyone else in my whole 22 years of life"".

I think I'm thinking too much, but I'd like to hear from what everyone else thinks of this. I also would like to think that it isn't a crime to simply admire something from afar even if it's something that wouldn't ever be yours. So anyway, prove me wrong or confirm my doubts so that I can stop thinking about this altogether. My utmost appreciation for your genuine inputs on the matter.

after gone through quite a busy work. 
Sitting in MRT while looking at phone, 
hoping for someone who would reply when I messaged them; few hours ago.
None of them were replied, the whole day the phone was silent,
even it was not on 'silent mode', not even from family members.

Changing from MRT to taking bus, a few walks from the station.
Waited at bus station, while listening to classical,
where sometimes I am wondering about myself, 
why the young me would listen to hundreds of years of pieces,
perhaps it was the old soul of me,
looking for peace in the business of the cities.

Sitting while enjoying the classical,
a group of four young men attracting my attention;
not because of their good looks,
but their playfulness, their laugh, their stories sharing,
they are comfortable with each other.

Perhaps I am crazy for smiling while looking at them talking with each other,
until the realization came to me; I felt lonely.
It ruined my smile.
I looked away from them, thinking back how lonely I am,
most of the time working my own shit alone,
having meals all alone most of the time,
watching movies all alone,
everything I've done, it was alone all the time.

My 4 years boyfriend broke up with me few months ago,
the reason was; it's time for him to have normal relationship,
instead of gay relationship with me.
thus I am all alone without any sexual contacts since then,
I guess he's making the right decision for himself 
and I felt happy for him.

I stayed alone far from my family.
My family and I were okay,
no strain and pain in familial relationship,
but we're barely contacting to each other
where it is norms for us.

I don't have much friends,
my JC time was ruined because I admitted myself as gay,
my whole classmate alienated me,
including my ex best friends.
Ever since then, I am not simply making friends with everyone
as I don't want the pain for being alienated repeating,
over and over again.

I am all alone most of the time,
with the musics and phone as my friends,
perhaps I enjoyed being alone,
but I am not fancy being in loneliness.

Distracted from been overthinking of being alone,
the bus came and I tapped my card for entry,
going back to final destination of the day;
a house which is not a home,
preparing for the same life cycle the next day.

At work, there’s this colleague who sort of is my rival is besting me to a campaign pitch that I have been working my butt off for. On the other hand, my wife and I have been fighting over my tendencies to skip my appointments at the fertility center. We have been trying to conceive for the past 5 years and my wife thinks that a trip down to the fertility center would help us conceive. The tensions of my marriage and stress at work drew me to my wits end that I would do anything just to turn my life over for the better. 

One day my rival at work approached me at a company dinner party and I asked him for the secret to his new positive outlook on life. He recommended this shady ass spa which cost me a whopping $50,000. But money was not a problem as I was a desperate man yearning to revive my career and to start anew with my wife. At the spa, 2 Korean men explained that the process to being a better man lies working rebuilding my DNA. After that I was told to wear a diaper and was led into a room where I was sedated. 

Here’s where things got wonky. I woke up the next moment in a plastic bag then enclosed my body, in my own makeshift grave. I panicked and ran home naked and afraid until I heard a man who was upstairs in my room with my Wife. I steadied myself, went to the garage and grabbed a shovel ready to take this man on as he came down the stairs. To my horror, this man was me! This new me claimed to be me and even had my memories. My clone had recalled waking up at a spa and we both drove down to the spa to confront the Koreans. 

Apparently, the Koreans have been improving their clients’ lives by cloning a better version of their clients, and then murdering the original person. I was the sole survivor of this process due to a malfunction in their process. My clone and I were both appalled at this revelation and now we can’t decide who should continue leading my life. Any tips I can get to solve this identity crisis?

We eventually got together, and that was when he opened up more and I started noticing that I wasn’t comfortable with his lifestyle and habits. I found out that apparently he wasn’t doing much for the business and pretty much bummed around the whole day. He also spent many sleepless nights playing poker and boasted to me how his few days of earnings from poker can even exceed my monthly salary. He’s from a very rich family and basically behaved like a spoiled kid even at his age (late 20s). He bought me expensive meals and gifts but I knew it was either using his parents’ money or from gambling and it made me feel uneasy. I broke up with him after a few months for all these reasons and he was furious, as he accused me of not loving him enough to give him chance to improve before dumping him. Vicious words were exchanged, and the immature way he handled the breakup (he even threw my phone across the room) made me hate him even more. 

Few weeks after the breakup, he started contacting me again, thanking me for teaching him an important lesson despite all the hurt and he said he’s working towards becoming a better person. Soon, he shared with me that he had secured a decent job. He stopped gambling completely and spent the time working out and learning new skills instead. He sent me gifts on my birthday and souvenirs from his holiday trips. Again and again he expressed his appreciation to me for inspiring him to lead a more fulfilling life and saying how badly he wanted to see me now. However, never once did I respond to him. Even when we happened to bump into each other once and he called my name several times, I pretended not to see him. My heart was still cold remembering the spoiled kid that he used to be, I refused to believe that he indeed has changed.

Fast forward about 1.5 years to today, he still contacts me from time to time. I guess time really heals, I no longer have bad feelings for him now. In fact I felt kinda guilty for ignoring him all these while. So I was just thinking whether it’s weird if I suddenly respond to him now (he just texted again recently), apologise for my lack of response so far etc and try to be friends with him? Should I be open to the idea of starting a relationship with him all over again if he’s still keen, now that he’s a changed person? My worst fear is that he’ll go back to his old ways one day and disappoint me again, am I thinking too much here?

1856,"The first time I ever tasted a fresh French baguette was on 31 Aug this year. Ever since then, I’ve had this insatiable craving for them. Night or day, all I can think about is baguettes..

I’m wondering has anyone else felt like this before? I’m afraid of telling my friends or family because I know they will judge me or think I’m joking, but I’m not. It’s been really stressful trying to hide my baguette addiction from them. I almost got exposed when I brought a baguette with me everyday to my group projects, and my friends asked me what’s my problem. Since then I’ve only eaten them in secret, usually I will go to one of the toilets in BIZ1 because they’re quite private.

Anyway, I wish the cafes in school would sell baguettes! It’s really troublesome bringing one with me to school every morning, especially when the trains and busses are so crowded. Sometimes people give me a nasty look because they think I’m poking them with something, but it’s really just my bread. 

It’s really stressing me out, and I don’t know what to do about this. Should I see a doctor?

1862,"Ever since I left Singapore for an overseas exchange programme, my Singaporean BF has been taking a long time to respond to my texts. Eventually, I gave up and found another guy (non-Singaporean) who is studying in the same university. I moved in with him last weekend. Everything seems to be going well, so after much deliberation, I have made my final decision: I am going to break up with my singaporean Bf.

The problem is this: when I left for exchange, my Singaporean BF transfered me a sum of money for rent and living expenses. Since I intend to break up with him, should I return his money? On one hand, it feels weird to be using an ex's money. On the other hand, my personal finances are quite tight right now, and even though my non-singaporean BF does not charge me rent, I still need to spend quite a bit on living expenses. Maybe I should return some % of the money and keep the rest? I have been overseas for approximately 2 months. The entire exchange programme lasts approximately 10 months. So I should keep 20% of the money and return 80%?

1865,"As an alumnus, just wanna remind NUS students not to settle for a low paying job just because (everyone tells you) the market is bad or because you are getting anxious from seeing others securing offers. Don't settle for less than what you think you deserve. Take your time. Go for one with decent pay. Many would tell you that starting salary isn't important and what is more important is the experience you can gain. I would say that both are equally important; Starting salary is important because your next employer would use it as a benchmark for how much they are offering you. When searching for your next job, imagine a candidate whose current salary is only 10% less your asking salary while another candidate’s salary is 30% less than your asking salary. Employers are more inclined to deem the former's request as reasonable and try negotiate it down with the latter because a 30% raise seems more unreasonable.
Also, if you choose a job that pays you say, $300 less than your peer, you take an additional two years for your pay increment to match up to theirs. And this discrepancy of income continues because they're likely to have increment over the two years as well. Not forgetting that you’re also losing out in your bonuses.
TLDR: Don't let employers lowball you if you have the skillset to demand a higher pay. Do not settle for less than what you think you are worth.

1867,"For the past 4 days, it has been tough for me to swallow my feelings up after my break up. This sadness has been eating my insides and my mind, giving me great grief and regret for not making our relationship official earlier. 
My girlfriend had dumped me as she said: ""if our relationship is not official, I take it as you don't want to commit into our relationship.""  Does commitment into a relationship has to be represented by our official identities? 
I promised her that I would make it official once I am able to cope with my studies at the end of the semester. The fact that we are not official gave her a sense of insecurity although I have spent my time to be together with her and do whatever I can to make plans with her every day and every week to sustain our relationship.
As time goes on, she started to be cold to me. She has lost her enthusiasm in me and she started rejecting my invitation from time to time. I asked her why and she replied that she was busy with her exams and assignments. I do understand that and thus I try to make time for her whenever she's available. 
After numerous plans and numerous rejections , I have started to catch her hanging out with another friend of mine on a daily basis. I thought it was not a big deal until she begin to refuse to go out with me just to join that friend during her free time. I wanted to talk about this but I felt like it was childish. For example, in one afternoon during her break, I asked her out for lunch and she refused by saying that she went out with her coursemates. Coincidentally, I bumped into the two of them (both from different courses) walking back from lunch and that hurt me like mad, I was confused. Why did she cheat me just to join him? She could've been honest with me when I asked her.
One month later, she broke up with me leaving me with grief for not making our relationship official and at the same time instilling jealousy inside me. I was depressed, sleep deprived, lacked focus and it all got worse when I saw them happily together going out together for outdoor activities.
I felt like shit, even up till now. I have put in my effort , time and my own trust into this relationship and it ended in the most most MOST misserable way. I can't bottle up these feelings any longer. I feel betrayed.
Does loving someone can only be allowed when the relationship is official? Don't you ever feel guilty sometimes for pushing me away for someone else while I'm here needing your love and attention?

Really annoyed at how rude some of them can be. Pity for those who had to live a life with these insufferable buffoons (F to pay respect our brothers and sisters that have endured hell). 

Yes I know not all old folks are like this. And it is not always the case that they are entitled or are screwed up people. Some could have just been in a bad mood that day, we never know their stories. There is still a portion out there who are just pure asshats and I'm glad time isn't on their side. Just sucks that my taxes is going to fund their social services or nonsense packages that further fuels egoistic entitlement (bloody hell, each and every generation thereafter is going to expect some sweet juicy deeds and the burden of funding it lies with us), their only contribution to society was to just show us how much of a mistake they are (Why did the ancestors not pull out? Durex commercials should also show these dingbats as reason why condom is encouraged instead of just bratty children). Don't pull the ""older generation plants the tree, younger generation gets the shade"" argument. Some of these entitled pricks did jack for society. Not all old folks are entitled and not all old folks made positive contributions.

Again, i'm not referring to all old people, just the really entitled dingoes. There's many out there that deserves so much more help and it just sucks that these bloody mops are making a bad name of others. We should not excuse their rude behaviour and should actively call them out.

1872,"I feel extremely lonely. I have friends, close friends, with whom I hang out. I am reasonably social. I take part in CCAs and stuff.  But I crave for something more than friendship. It’s not sex but more like intimacy and exclusivity. Even when I am in a crowd or hanging out with my friends I feel lonely. 

Background - I have only been in one relationship that lasted a couple of months in 2016. I am a virgin and I haven’t dated anyone since. 

My issue is even when I hang out with my friends, especially female friends, I always have this feeling that we will never be more than friends, since most of them are already attached. I feel like I am the only one with nobody in my life, nobody consistent. That my life has no stability because of it.  And that makes me feel miserable. 
I’ve tried to distract myself from this feeling by focusing on studies, hobbies etc but it does not last. I can’t keep it up anymore. This loneliness is killing me. 

Sometimes I even contemplate taking my own life and when I think of that the first question that comes to mind is ‘would anyone really miss me if I did it?’ and for a long time I’ve tried to convince myself that there are people in my life who would miss me but I am not entirely sure I can keep up this lie. And if the day comes where I can no longer convince myself that someone would miss me then I am fairly confident that, that is the day I will end up killing myself. 

My question is what can I do about it. It’s a very specific problem. I just want someone in my life who I care about, who cares for me, with whom I am exclusive with. I want to feel loved and secure, something that cannot happen with just friendship. 

I have tried dating apps but with no success. I find it so meaningless and tiring and I hardly get any matches and even those who do match hardly ever reply. I don’t even know if getting into a relationship is the right move at this point, even if someone ever wanted to date me, because I feel like now I am more in love with the idea of a relationship than with the person I would be in a relationship with. 

What do I do? I want to stop feeling this way. I can’t go on living miserable like this.

Then after we went back he messaged me and said he liked me secretly that he keep hinting on me by saying I am similar to his girlfriend. But the problem is he liked me more than his own girlfriend. I don’t know how to reply him after.

I was thinking that if he liked me more than his girlfriend, why he make comparison of me with his girl and everything are the same?! Is it because I am guy?

To be frank, I don’t have intention liking him at all before but it seems that my feelings started to sprouted out towards him. What should I do?

1895,"Here is an advice to go eco-friendly. In my attempt to reduce/reuse my usage of paper, I asked my lecturer if she would be okay with me submitting hardcopy assignments using rough paper (i.e. useless paper that is printed on ONE side) and she actually said yes! So friends, try asking your teachers if they allow you to print submissions with used paper - pretty sure most will say yes because of recent pressure over climate change etc. No harm asking. When there is a will, there is a way.

Also, as someone who jots down notes on paper instead of on computer, I have switched from writing it on notepads to writing it on used rough paper, and then filing them up afterwards. So for those still writing on foolscap or notebooks, u can consider writing lecture notes on rough paper. (I have lots of rough paper at home, that's why. And you can actually get them from the CLB printing room too - esp at the unclaimed printouts tray)

So, here's the thing. He is more high drive than me. I have no qualms giving it to him when he ask for it. And when I say no he respects that. 
The thing is, because he is more high drive, he initiates it more often (like 99% of the time?) and I rarely initiates it. Not that I don't have a desire for it. But, Because the frequency (of his initiation) is already higher than my frequencies of desires, that’s why I rarely initiate it. 
So, for me sex is not as exciting now cos it is done without me having an internal ""desire"". We just do sex but I am not able to give my best because internally I am not “fired up”. 
I don’t think he would like it if I reduce the frequency, but I honestly think it wld help with that part of our life because it would get me more excited and involved and perform better?
Does anyone have a similar problem of varying sex drive and how to deal with it? Am I right to ask to reduce the frequency or shld I just continue with the flow?

But I just feel so, bitter and jealous, when I see friends who earn so much less, spend so much more, live the high and easy life, because they are born into a rich family. They always tease me for earning so much more than them and yet dressing/eating like their maid or driver. Even those friend who are not rich and earn much less than me laugh at me for acting like them, they think I'm putting on a show of being poor. And worse, some don't believe that what I have accomplished is real. They think it must be from my parents, although they have never given me a cent of money after graduation, only true love and affection and discipline.

I know I'm doing the right thing, I might not be able to sustain this breakneck work pace and income forever. I have aging parents to take care of, and plans to marry the most wonderful girl in my world. But that tight and bitter feeling when my peers show up for supper with a car that they would never be able to afford (monthly cost more than their whole damn salary), go travel the world anytime because they work (or not) in the family business, or even buy into an investment without mulling it over for days because they can afford to lose the money: its a sucky feeling to have.

1917,"In response to OP of #71083, 

I hope this response is not too late for you. 
I think I am in a very similar situation with your sister, with the same diagnosis.
I also withdrew from my friends because I found it very hard to trust people because of personal experiences. There was a long period of time when I did not feel like meeting up with anyone,  but sort of forced myself to do so some times because I don't think it solved problems. Fortunately, it is not the case now.

Many times, I don't understand myself. In fact, every moment, I am trying to make sense of myself. It is an extremely frustrating route. At least for her, counselling helps, but for me, it works to a limited extent. Perhaps that very advice the counselor provided your sister with has been the answer she is seeking for desperately in a sea of unanswered questions, hence she has been sticking to it faithfully. Perhaps, it even eases her anxiety and makes her feel a little happier and at ease - something she has not been experiencing for a long time.

Many times, the things we do don't make sense to people. I am equally guilty of not explaining in detail to others my actions, because 1) I doubt others will understand because they are not in my shoes, regardless of how much they care for me 2) I don't even know for sure what is happening to myslef, how am I going to explain to others? 

There is no use in using logic because it will worsen the situation. In fact, I realise I have been very sensitive to people who did it and many times, the words they uttered made me feel more stressed, anxious and useless. 

I read a comment that said that we are self-entitled. I admit that I am, and your sister may be too, depending on how you see it. Perhaps, the self-entitlement comes from us not explaining in full what happened to us, hence it seems that we are doing anything we want without considering others. But, it can also be seen as a strategy to cope with ourselves, ableit logically, not a long-term one.

I cannot say for sure that your sister is experiencing the exact same feelings as me, but I hope it will let you understand her better. 

Like what commentors have raised, I recommend you to meet/contact her counselor to find out more about your sister's condition. Even better if you can consult him/her together to close the communication gap. 

I realised that anxiety and depression may last for a long time, perhaps even a life time, as a relapse can happen so unprecedentaly and mood swings seem to be unavoidable. Hence, it is even more important for you to be by her side. 

I wish for your family to understand how to treat her better, and for your sister to feel better overtime. Also, be prepared to face more unpredictable problems in near future, especially if her trigger is studies and she has yet to complete hers. 

I am very glad that your sister took LOA because I really regret not taking one when my anxiety was at its peak. Seeing the counselor and taking LOA are signs that she is helping herself and not letting herself slip further into this incoherent mental mess, which is important in tackling with such issues. 

Hopefully, we will find answers and solutions to this incoherent mess one day. 

Meanwhile, I hope that the general public can be more open to us. I am fortunate enough to meet many people who helped me along but I am still struggling. I cannot imagine people in the same situation who don't.

1937,"Hi OP #71206,

Entertainment websites or applications are addictive because they provide us with instant gratification. They hook us further by misleading us with the perception that virtual badges or titles would help to increase our social worth, and thus, offer us a perceived increase in our self-esteem -- helping us to feel better and cope with situations that we deem ugly. However, badges -- like the ""Top Fan"" badge -- are bankrupt accessories if you think about it. They only reflect the lost time spent on social media and nothing more. Think, rationalise: how has this badge helped in your self-development?

To dilute your addiction, I'd suggest engaging in activities that you enjoy to make you an even more wholesome individual although I’m pretty sure you’re one already :)! You can go for painting classes, do sports, head for a coffee workshop… yada yada… there're just too many to list! For me, I deactivate my IG account periodically (every winter/summer vacation) to remind myself that time is too precious to be wasted on social media. Just last summer, I met up with a friend to do kayaking, met up with another to watch a performance at Esplanade, read 2 books, wrote a poem with a flamboyant friend, met up with a Prof for afternoon tea and to discuss about writing conference papers, etc., etc., ...

Anyway, if you need a social-media-detox buddy, I’m right here for ya! We can deactivate our accounts any time and engage in some healthy, enjoyable (non-illicit) activities!

Cheers,
Concerned K.

At the very least, make it explicit that they are welcome to share the tables/seats with students. And I hope we students will embrace the idea should it happen. 

I asked some of them why they don't just use the tables along the corridors. Some told me they don't dare to do so because they are afraid of receiving complaints from students. Others told me it is more important to save the tables for us because we are studying hard.

But he never thinks it is an issue when we were toghether. And he is somewhat materialistic and calculative, but he try to hide it so I only detect it from very subtle and minor things. Some examples are when he treat a bunch of friends he count the bill for so long while we all just seat there and wait, it's so awkward. And he will treat twice because the first time the place is not good some friends are not enjoying... Pls just don't treat if you are not ready. I mean your wallet. Another time he slip out that he chooses me because I can alleviate the financial burden if we go to buy a house...ps.

He cheated and was wrong, SO? He learned from his mistakes understood what is love and was trying his best. Yet society only harps on his past mistakes. Us humans, people are capable of change. When you were a kid, surely you made mistakes your momma or Papa smacked you for, what do you do? You learn. In school when you make mistakes, even multiple of them what do you do? You learn. Life is ever growing and ever learning and he recognises his mistakes and did. 
He was on Tinder again after the break up SO? Tinder is more than a platform for dating or hooking up, you got to TALK to people and what is wrong with TALKING to someone post- tragedy? Seriously stop being so narrow minded people. 
Come on LOOK, fellah was saving up for a engagement ring before National Service, WHO DOES THAT unless they are sure their partner is the one for them after all they been through? Tell me you will think of that in your early days before you even join the army. TELL me you will do that if you wanted to cheat because I know I WONT because in the 27 years of my life I have never seen or heard anything like it. Look at him now! He cant even BE FRIENDS WITH HER. Have a heart
I am not showing him pity, for what he did in the past, there is a price to pay for sure but this is definitely a big OOF to not be able to even be friends at all. 
Us as a society in Singapore? Its really quite disappointing to see you people go straight for the negatives and fail to see the current predicament. That is why so many people have depression or cannot deal with depression because us as a society WE REEK, the ratio to negativity vs positivity or even neutrality is too ridiculous.
IF you want to be negative why not do both sides? Why just the guy who confessed his mistakes? why not look at the opportunistic fellah that went straight for it after that relationship? So what if he treats her right at the start? He dont need to go through that this guy has gone through, he already has a prime example. THINK ABOUT IT he had that in his mind a while to be this opportunistic ughh disgust.
I do not know either of them and I do not think either of them is right, but I feel that we gotto be more fair and sometimes put ourselves in the position to see anothers plight. At least show that our society still has a heart.

1969,"I recently attended a reunion session with a few of my NS platoon mates, including the sergeants and lieutenants who were with us during our mandatory service period.

Throughout the session, some of the sergeants and lieutenants shared that they had dreams of furthering their education in universities, but are unable to do so because they either lacked good grades or needed to be financially stable as soon as possible (because their family isn't well to do). For one particular lieutenant, he shared that he came from a broken family and had to help his mum with taking care of the children and family chores during his primary school time. And because of that, he wasn’t able to keep up with his studies – thus, performing below average for his PSLE and O levels. This carried on to his JC life where he had to work part-time to support his mother and siblings. Moreover, he also shared that he felt ‘tremendously envious’ of his university friends whenever they were talking about their school assignments, CCAs, project work, and other academic stuff that he would never be able to experience in person. Upon hearing that, a part of me felt really guilty because I’ve always complained about my tertiary life without ever thinking once about the people who had to forgo their study opportunity because of their family circumstances. It was such an emotional story that a few of us had trouble holding back our tears…

Tbh, I’m so grateful to have attended the reunion session right now because I’ve learnt to see education as a privilege rather than an entitlement. My only regret is that I wish this realisation could have come earlier… 

So for those who are struggling in university (like me) or are crumbling under the academic pressure (like me again), please don’t give up and know that there will always be people rooting for you by your side! If you’ve none, I’ll be your first! Please cherish this study opportunity/privilege that you have! ????

I’m the ex gf that was contacted by a friend who knows his supposedly most recent gf. My friend came to me for help to persuade her to break up with him. So we contacted and managed to uncover the lies and his cheating doings. We officially broke up on 18 August 2019 and he was together with her on 21 August 2019. He started dating her in May 2019 (believed to be the period when I was overseas). I was together with him for 6 months (19 Feb’19- 18 Aug’19) and he told her that his last relationship was 2-3 years ago, when it was more like 2-3 days ago. 

In summary, the main “issues” of the relationship revolves around:
1. Monetary issues - Over paying of meals, the wear and tear of his prized possession a BMW 335i that he doesn’t pay season parking for on some months and tailgate other cars out. And I even paid for his season parking for 2 months cause I couldn’t bear to see him having to wait and tailgate other cars out. 
2. Staying over at each other’s place 
3. Physical touch because we didn’t sleep with him thank god 

He mentioned that he hate cheaters and that he will never cheat because it’s low and just not his style. So apparently if what he said was true I assume he hates himself then. The relationship went downhill apart from the usual quarrels over the 3 main issues when I wasn’t able to help him achieve his goal of the 2019 to get a Rolex Hulk. He wanted me to use my credit card to get him the Rolex and he claims that he will pay me back. I didn’t agree to it and he started making a fuss, verbally abusing me for being selfish. Eventually, I couldn’t take it anymore and I broke up with him. 

After we broke up he still IG message on and off saying that he miss my dogs and me, despite being attached. Asking if he is still my dog’s dad while I find a replacement. He also tried to ask me out a few times to “thank me” but honestly thanks but no thanks. 

Breaking up with him was the best decision I made this year. Through this incident, we come out to be bestie having been through the same torment.

1979,"I come from a humble background, both my parents only had primary school education and you can imagine the opportunities that were limited for them. Despite that I am really thankful for them that I was given the best they could afford. 

However, there is a part of me that feel inferior growing up, being surrounded by friends who are well to do; affording holiday at least once a year, having parents with connections that could secure them internships and opportunities. It feels like the inequality gets worse as i progress up the social ladder. It gets even sicker in the workplace when people around my age talk about appreciating the different type of wine, savouring the multitude of western cuisine, travelling to exotic places every break. I'm here at the corner just trying to repay my tuition loan, thinking of where to eat the next kuay peng and where to bring my gf to eat Singapore's best kuaychap.

Having climbed this far, I'm proud of myself and my root but how do I really mix with people from more privileged background when all wine taste the same to me?

1980,"Hi I’m the girl who posted #70976. Just a update, we broke up, and he tried to patch things back by saying how I’ve left the relationship too early, and I was being selfish because he was always there fighting for our relationship while I was complacent. Despite all my friend’s advise I felt guilty and I wanted to go back to him. That was when my friend noticed that he looks familiar, and my friend actually knows his ex gf. I reached out to her, and she actually told me the real story they broke up. He told me that he was single for 3 years and the reason they broke up was because he still had feelings for his first GF, and he wasn’t ready to be in a relationship and that’s why they broke up. 

The ex GF side of the story: They also had monetary issues, about how he was always paying for things while she didn’t. But the actual fact that she paid for their trips, payed for his season parking and his insurance. How he also asked her to buy a Rolex watch for him. And how he blamed her for not pulling her weight in the relationship, and how he was always the one holding the relationship. He also mentioned to her that “in a relationship it was important to be physical, and if there wasn’t, he was pretty sure that the relationship will not last.” (He said the same thing to me too, but thank god we both didn’t sleep with him) he also told her that he hates cheater and he will never be that low life that would cheat. She also told me how he would always guilt her into buying things for him. And into staying in the relationship. 

He told the both of us that his last relationship was 3 years ago. Here is the kicker, they (the ex gf and him) broke up on 18 July and we officially started dating on 21 July. Which means that he was still attached when we started seeing and getting to know each other. 

Needless to say I didn’t feel guilty for dumping his sorry ass. AND, after all of these drama at least I came out with a new bestie who knows exactly what I’ve went thru. <3

1985,"Hi Prof Ben, 

Would like to have your advice and inputs for my concern below.

I am interested in the UX/UI, multimedia/graphics/illustrator etc field. Is it advisable to take up a degree in Computer Science in local uni or take up a Multimedia/Graphic course etc in private uni?

As I'm not sure if the field I am interested in are suitable for me or something I would enjoy in the long run and also in terms of the availability of the job opportunities/salary. Hence I thought of studying computer science would be more advisable as it is considered general IT degree and will be able to apply to the UX/UI, multimedia/graphics/illustrator etc field too? (Please correct me if m wrong)

However if I choose to take up a multimedia/graphic course etc, if in the future I am not keen anymore or would like a career switch to other areas in IT. The degree I get might not be able to allow me to jump to other areas in IT.

I feel I am not technically as strong as I do not have a programming background and I don't think I am a fast learner. If I take up the computer science course, would it tough for me to catch up. What should I do? 

Thank you.

1987,"This happened during my orientation a few years ago. During one of the water games at the swimming pool, an OGL came by to brief a few of us girls. We were in the water while he was at the pool edge and squatted down to speak to us. 

After a while one of my friends did an excited squeal and tugged at me under the water. She whispered to me that she could see the OGL's dick and sure enough, it seems like the OGL was going commando under his FBT shorts.

Since it was a small group I told the OGL that we could see his privates, but surprisingly he pulled the bottom of his shorts a little to show more and asked if we like it? The three of us giggled and we were actually quite excited as he was such a hot OGL and we were frankly talking about him being so hot during the entire camp.

But now with all the recent events about NUS sexual harassment and peeping toms, I wonder if what he did was sexual harassment and if we should have reported him.

2002,"Any tips on getting over a crush on a co-worker? 
I’m working full time currently and a few months back my boss hired a new male staff for our team (my office is predominantly filled with female employees). He’s a year younger than me, tall and quite good looking by societal standards.

The situation wasn’t so bad initially as he was sitting at another desk far away from me. We usually have lunch together as a team as part of our company’s team bonding culture so we do spend a lot of time together. We had some interaction then but nothing too major. The issue arose when my boss moved him to sit beside me as he wanted me to coach him on his work.
He has been sitting beside me for about 2-3 months now and through our daily conversations, I realized that we have similar interests and share the same sense of humor. We even had the same CCAs from school and sometimes we would give the same comebacks to jokes at the same time. We are getting along so well together that I’m afraid that I’m starting to feel something more for him. Often times, I caught myself paying more attention to him than needed for work. It has not blossomed into a full blown crush yet but I know it would, if I let myself fall into it. 

The thing is that he’s attached (obviously, since I wouldn’t be posting this if he was single). He mentioned it multiple times to me/us during his first day at work (I remember rolling my eyes at it because I’m a salty, single-af-bitch). It doesn’t help matters when I found out from him that his girlfriend was the one who made the first move to ask him out and ‘pursued’ him relentlessly because it made me hate the phrase ‘timing is everything’ even more. She is his first girlfriend and they have only just gotten together a few months ago. I can only curse my own goddamn luck that I was not the one who met him first. She is 4 years younger than me btw and I really feel like telling her, “Sister, you have at least another few years to find a new and/or two to three more boyfriend(s) before you settle down whereas laoniang here is working with a tight timeline. Please siam and move along.” Sigh. 

Anyway, please, any tips for me? I have no interest in getting in the middle of their relationship and being a third party. It’s tough enough having to stop myself from being so attracted to him and yet having to see him everyday. Please help!

As a prereg, I realise that my colleagues keep talking about empowering patients and letting them take charge of their health, or something along the lines of ""we should be role models for our patients"", but all these are so hard to achieve. I mean, just look at the number of patients out there who think that they are smarter than us and challenge us with our therapy recommendations. Like I dont even see my role as a community prereg pharmacist anymore if patients continuously ignore my advice and engage in unhealthy activities. No wonder my preceptors rather use their mobile phones than talk to their patients. To be honest you all will fare better if you work elsewhere. Even better, go into other profession like selling insurance or becoming a childcare facilitator. At least the toddlers are easier to manage than the adults coming to your local pharmacy. So glad that I have the choice to choose another profession after my prereg training concludes at the end of this year.

I'm content with my single lifestyle, having hobbies that I can immerse myself in and a small group of close friends that I usually hang out with. 

However, I am starting to wonder if I am missing out on major milestones. A lot of people in NUS seem to be attached, and from what I know, many people of my age have dated at least once. Sometimes my friends would share stories of their significant other, while I would quietly and cluelessly listen (because of obvious reasons. lol).

While I am open to the idea of dating a girl while studying, I am not actively looking for a partner (not that it makes a difference; I don't club nor drink so maybe people would perceive me as boring? I don't know how clubbing is fun but that's a separate issue altogether). I did try Tinder just for the sake of having dating experience, but I deleted the app the next day after downloading it because it felt way too toxic for me (I don't know why sugar daddies are so popular among girls there but... sure).

We've been broken up for a few month but I feel like I didnt get any closure even though i was the one who initiated the break up. 

You live right in the prime district of singapore and I live an hour away from you. Your family is obviously well to do whereas mine live in a 3 room flat. When we got together after a few months you visited my place and called it gross. Obviously I felt sad and inferior, but I brushed it off because I thought to myself, yes it's gross compared to yours. So I'm always the one who goes over to your place, staying over the weekend etc. You always wanted me to stay over friday through monday. I felt suffocated after the honeymoon period and asked that I have Sunday to myself, you got angry. Throughout the 3 years of the relationship you've only visited my place less than 5 times. When I told you sometimes it's tiring travelling from home to school and all, maybe you could come over instead, you straight out tell me no and if I feel unfair, I dont have to go over to your place anymore. It sounded like you were threatening to break up. So I sucked it up. 

We both have dogs, yours is a pure breed with some sort of certification whereas mine is a mongrel that I adopted. Whenever you walk your dog, if there's someone walking a mongrel you will say things like ""eww. Better not come near my dog"". Your parents once commented during a family dinner at home that ""stray dogs should just be shot dead in the streets"". You all laughed it off and I got so angry with that comment that I had to leave the table and cut the dinner short. When I told you how I felt you just said ""so?"". Is it an elitist thing? That only pure breed dogs like yours deserve to live? 

You are extremely calculative. When we would go out to dinner, you split the bill down to every cent. When I dont have enough cash, you would remind me ""hey don't forget you still owe me $1.20"". Not that I'm gold digging but you constantly reminding me makes me feel like I'm trying to cheat your money which I'm not. Sometimes when we over order and I really cannot eat anymore, you will say things like ""eh this dish very expensive, you better finish it"". Which honestly made me very uncomfortable. 

You are spoilt, rude and selfish. My parents aren't rich but they do the best they can for me. Sure, I had to work part time and take out a student loan for my education just like most singaporeans. You told me my parents shouldn't even have kids if they cannot afford basic things like education. That hurt. When expensive things break down in the house such as tv/refrigerator, I will fork out some money to lighten the load for my parents. You got angry and told me I shouldn't have done that, it is not my responsibility and I should save the money instead. 

You constantly find things to fight about. You dont let me hang out with my friends just because they have a different political view. You criticise the people and things I care about. When you found out sometimes I donate money to SPCA or SOSD (small amounts), you scolded me. Said we use the money to travel better.

We are completely different and I know the break up was the right decision. 

I guess this post was my very indirect way of spilling everything out to you and to air my grievances.

2020,"A long time ago, when my husband was young and naive, he didn’t know how to cherish his vast family fortune and lost it all quite flippantly. As a result, the house we were staying in got repossessed by some Ang mo creditor. My husband disappeared as well after getting into debt, leaving us to pay off his debts and fend for ourselves.

As my kids and I had nowhere else to go, we begged the creditor to let us stay in our home, and in return we will work hard to pay off the debt with interests.

Despite overwhelming hardship, we not only paid off the debt, we also managed to upgrade our home and made several improvements.

One day, our creditor told us that we have successfully paid off so off all that we owed him, and that he is returning the title deed back to my husband! The house was his all along anyway.

Then, my husband came back into our lives.  Instead of the young foolish man he once was, he had morphed into a very successful and should I also say shrewd businessman. He amassed even more wealth and our house value is like spare change to him.

He came back and wanted to take responsibility for us. However our kids, after being used to not having him around, were apprehensive. He doesn’t stay with us, but beside us in a large bungalow. However off an on, he will pop by, and voice his displeasure if he sees the kids misbehaving, threatening to drag them back to his own house to be punished.

Naturally my kids are very unhappy. But for the life of me, I cannot comprehend why my kids started trashing their own house that they stay in, just to make a statement that they are upset at their dad’s high handed ways! We built the house together without their father, but they make no qualms about destroying the very house that we built! When our servants tried to stop them, my kids beat them up instead!!!

All these while, my husband looks on with bewilderment as well, since his own bungalow is still well and fine! When my mother tried to clean the mess they made, they started jeering at her as well! They said they are doing these things to show their dad they are angry with him, and wants him to pass the title deed back to them!
 
So super no brain. The house was never my kids in the 1st place. They even had the cheek to ask our creditor to come back and claim the house! I just want to spank the lights out of them!!! Unless bunch of brainless buggers. (Must be the dad’s foolish young genes!) Give birth to char Siew is better than giving birth to them!

2021,"Long story ahead(p.s not good at writing so sorry for my mistakes) : 

4 years ago, I started a relationship together with  this wonderful girl, she was kind, caring, compassionate and always by my side. 
However back then I did not know how to love, I have never really loved anyone in my life before. And throughout the first half of the relationship, I have cheated on her mentally and physically, been on tinder, flirted over and over, I was also abusive back then when we argued very badly. I am considered a class S Jerk? (At least thats how I feel about myself.)  All these young dumb and stupid mistakes were made and its going to haunt me all my life.

Throughout the relationship she found out about all of the above and wanted to break up, but I managed to convince her to stay and she always forgave me and stood by me no matter what and before long, I finally learned to love her with all my heart, not a single day goes by where I dont regret what I did in the early parts of my relationship and I really genuinely wanted to change for the better, she shaped me into a better person and I kept trying to be better because I want a future with her so badly.

Fast forward to this year, I got injured and so it was rather uneventful, we couldnt do much together as a couple, but despite that she always stood by me and I wanted to make it up to her after my surgery, I planned 3 surprises for her birthday, looked at overseas trips, planned christmas surprises and was actually saving up for an engagement ring on the side so that I can propose after NS (by then it would be 6-7 years in the relationship) and I honestly felt like this year was one of the better ones, we were happy or so I thought.... 

Then we started working part time together, during our time there, one of the guy was very friendly with her kept chatting her up and they texted excessively as well..despite me  expressing my discomfort, it didnt really change things. A few weeks later, we argued and honestly this arguments wasnt even one of the biggest we ever had and that very weekend I had to undergo surgery for my injury, and the week after, she still cared for me the same, but before long, I got the cold treatment, I could tell something was off but I couldnt put my finger on it. 

The next weekend, during one of the days she was out and mia-ed for hours, from 7 - 12 am, I was so worried something wouldve happened to her and I couldnt do anything because I was recuperating at home, when she texted again at 12, I was so relieved and mad at the same time, I chided her for going missing and before long she broke up with me saying the past 2 arguments was the last straw for her, I didnt want to break up so I arranged a f2f talk the next day and wanted to convince her to stay, but she was adamant and breaking up isnt a 2 sided thing, when one side decides its over, theres often nothing you can do about it. And so I tried the next best thing, I asked to stay as friends because even if we can't be together, I still want to be happy with her, share her upsets with her even as a friend, I want to stand by her and I know I will be content and maybe I could still execute all the surprises that I had planned.. 

She agreed initially, which was something good, but I was in misery, I was distraught, depressed.. Iam glad we were still friends but the fact that we arent together anymore killed me.. I wanted to talk to someone after the breakup so I went onto dating apps and tried to talk to people, get different perspectives from strangers who made it easier to ask for advice because they didnt know me.

She found out that I was on those apps again and she instantly blocked me off all platforms saying she wants nothing to do with me ever again, and so there goes my chance of even being her friend.

I tried asking her to meet again to talk, in hopes of salvaging something but she wouldnt see me, she agreed initially because my family contacted her and backed of last minute... So I tried, I went to get some of her favourite cake and travelled all the way down to her work places in my crutches post surgery in hopes that we could talk over the cake and still be friends at least, but no she didnt want to see me at all and had her friend send me away.. 

Before long, the guy which I mention from work told her that he is the right one for her..kind of a low blow if you ask me, but coincidence? I dont know, but I knew I was right to be uncomfortable and now, they are out together a lot.. Then again who is to blame other than me? I was the one that caused the cracks and created the opportunity to exist in the first place.

But even so, my love for her doesnt change, I will always love her even if I cannot be by her. Until today, I still cry my heart out each night (kinda serves me right dont you think? Karma comes around. ) But my heart only has the capacity to love her and I dont think I will ever love again unless its her and right now all I can do is to respect her wishes and stay away from her, as long as shes happy, I guess its worth it. 

Whats the point of this story? Well recently, I have been diagnosed with depression and had a few rough episodes, truth is I dont really know what to do, I guess maybe by confessing my past sins and sharing this story on this ""confession"" platform might help me deal with it... Like how people always confess their sins in their religion..

But I also hope this story would also help all of you out there in a relationship, hold on to it dearly like each moment is your last, love each other like theres no tomorrow and dont make foolish mistakes that will haunt you.. And to those not being in a relationship, only be in one when you are ready... Because love can go away so quickly in a blink of an eye and by then it will be too late for regrets. Trust me, I learnt it the hard way. 

I know this story has more than enough details for you to identify that I am talking about us, and in the small chance that you happen to read this post, I apologise in advance if it makes you feel uncomfortable or upset that I am sharing it, it is not my intention to add to your discomfort. Also I havent seen you in a while and I hope you are happier, bear in mind that I will always love you though we are no longer together and that you are always my first and happiest thought whenever I need to produce a patronus

2022,"My sister who's been going for therapy for depression and anxiety recently told me that she's learned that it's ""better"" to just look out for yourself. She blames us for trying to help her and not expect appreciation in return (e.g. we cook a meal for her, and she does not like the meal, scolding us for trying to think for her; or wake her up to remind her of an appointment and she gets mad that we would try to force her awake when she could have just missed her appointment since she was too tired anyway). She is almost entirely convinced that there is no obligation to help another if you do not feel like it, and there is nothing that should infringe that personal right. 

I could argue by logic and try to convince her, but she is pretty adamant about her new world view. And her therapist says she is making progress. The only issue is that she is now further from the family than before because of her newfound views and while I encourage her to find her own life outside (to truly live out her ideals), she obviously is not ready - she is on LOA, she has no job and she does not want to work (because it is something that she does not want to do and no one can tell her what to do) (and my parents will never bear to let her truly be independent without a stable job, good grades etc)

Is there a way to solve this or am I wrong and this actually is not a problem?

But after knowing me (I can be pretty wild and crazy most of the times), they know I'm crazy and my rbf hides my true self. However, there are days when I'm sick or just simply tired to do stupid and crazy things (I'm always trying to make my friends laugh whether it's me acting stupid or saying jokes), so naturally my rbf will show, and I will realize my friends all acting careful around me, trying not to trigger me as though I'm angry. It has happened a few times so I've already made it clear to them that if I'm upset, I'll tell them - but normally if my rbf shows, it's because I'm genuinely exhausted. But it is still happening and I get the feeling that they are genuinely afraid of me. It annoys me that my friends (of three years) still feels and acts that way around me, but I literally have no idea what to do. It exhausts me thinking that I always have to act happy and crazy just for them to not feel afraid of me. I have asked them before to share their honest opinions of me, but they have never once said they are afraid of me or whatnot. Serious advice please -

2025,"I have been in a relationship with my bf ever since half a year now. I've understood that he is a goal oriented and intellectual man and those were the things that made me love him even more. On our first few months he was quite agressive for being sweet and attentive to me. Always making sure he replies to my messages and attends to my concerns. He is a very sweet guy hence I fell even more. We matched when it comes to intellectual conversations as well as simple ones too. And we've travelled to quite some places already around asia and will be planning to go to a lot more. In fact have booked our upcoming holidays too.

But just about 2 months now, he's been indulging himself with so much studies and stress that I still try my best to cheer on him. He's on his university studies and while I'm working, I am fully dedicated to waiting for him to finish studies and we can start building our lives together.

The thing is, he is so busy. Straight up ???? % attentiveness now to just 10%.. I don't know what happened to him but he often just seenzones my messages for the whole day, and he still wouldnt agree to post our photos online... Its been months since we started dating and I would always wonder why he wouldnt post our couple photos. He does say he love me and is pretty invested on me. And I would like to just believe it. Cause requiring him a lot would mean additional stress with his studies right?

I have tried to fit myself to him and his standards as per his request, but now that he's busy, I only asked for him to post our photos as a sign to let people see he is busy + committed. Something to make a girl feel secure and happy. I even reinstated that I wanted to be posted on social media as for various reasons but he really just doesnt wanna do it. I feel so broken and felt like an option only...


Correct me if I'm wrong but, most girls would want to be shown off on social media too isn't it? Am I giving too much to him since I've changed my interests and tried to understand his university schedules? I even go find him a lot of times when all he does is just to call at night to say goodnight. His reason is that he will just make it up to me on our travels but still insist a silent treatment on not posting our couple photo on any social media platform. No attention + hidden relationship = total anxiety eating me. 


If you were the guy, would you rather compensate just so you wouldnt loose your girl? How will you make it up to her on your very busy schedule? Any tips? I'm trying my best to save a dying relationship and all he say is we don't have a problem and I simply have to believe him. Is that enough to stick by?? Pls. Help. 


P. S. I would like to disclose that I often get compliments about how pretty I am and how people used to wonder why I'm single a year ago. So I don't see any point of him rejecting me or feeling cold towards me.

P. P. S. Considering my looks and university degree plus my attentiveness towards him, I don't know if he is just making me an option or is he already cheating on me?

Yes, true friends can exist. 

It's quite common that some people like the benefits of a ""friendship"" but not the costs associated with it. I remember there is a Chinese saying for it, but you know like most things in economics, some people like to take this for granted and do not appreciate it. 

If it is really unbearable, maybe it's time to say goodbye to C and K. Remember it's not just about whether you had known C since young or K close to 10 years. The question is what do you really know? 

Like many things in life, things change and more so for people, who can have their own independent hearts and minds. 

There is no need to feel sad. If they threw you away, pick yourself up, dust yourself down and remember, we will always be there for you. One big family.

I have been in a relationship for 2 years and my GF went to study abroad lately. She is overwhelmed with assignments and we hardly talk to each other, maybe once a week, sometimes less. We will still be in this distance relationship for a couple of months more. 

I was okay with that until I came across another girl lately, she was warm and caring and that just made me realize how not fulfilling my relationship has been. The chemistry, the emotion is not there like in our first days. I am not thinking of breaking up (yet) but I am not sure how long I can keep up with these issues unsorted out.

I intend to be honest with my GF about my feelings, the coldness of our relationship and see how we can fix it together but I am afraid I will hurt her. I tried to open this up indirectly a couple of times but she was not very interested to find out what I am really feeling.

I know my GF is very busy with her schoolwork and we both have a plan for our long-term commitment already. And the crush I am having won't last long anyway, I found out the other girl is relocating to another place soon (needless to say, I am sick of starting another distance relationship). Yet, having a feeling for another girl teaches me how my relationship does not fulfill my emotional needs.

So if you reading this, dear smokers, make sure you are extra careful that no one is beside you when you smoke, because I'll be waiting to report you.

Can the authorities also do something about this? (Aside from placing signboards because it is not working) Maybe install a CCTV (if there is currently none) and do random checks occasionally. Your help is much appreciated.

A mentor who thinks that there's no potential in my project and did not bother to guide or help me with the progress. A researcher in the lab who's out there to complain on nitty gritty things such as i should learn to handle instruments etc myself without even demo-ing to me; not even once and he complained to the prof about it. As such, approaching the end of this project, i'm at loss at what to do with failed experiment (that actually carried on due to the prof interest) and obviously with many people backstabbing behind my back, it's likely that i will not get a decent grade after sacrificing one whole summer and two semesters  to be a free labor for them. There was one such incident during summer when i did not go back during Friday as there was nothing scheduled on that day(i actually double confirmed with my mentor and he said no, nothing for that day)  and if i were to conduct experiment, they have to run in few consecutive days and friday is definitely not a good day to start experiments. So i did not go on friday and guess what? he texted me and scolded that i should be more active towards this project and come in to read some papers even though i had nothing to do. My friends said that i was letting these guys to push me around for such a long time and i should be saying something much earlier. Now that it was approaching the end and im really fearing for my grades, is it too late to say something to the department about the lack of proper guidance received (basically, no one in the group is working on the field of project i was working on and i was thrown into a situation when im left alone myself)? Did someone encounter such issues before? will writing in to the department helps?

So I've been going my own way for some time and randomly a friend of my whom recently got into a relationship with a girl he met in school asked if I was in a relationship. I told him I wasn't and am not intending to.

He immediately jumped out of laughter and said, ""more like you couldn't get any."" I was left baffled by his statement and asked why so?

He said, ""I've known you for 3 years and the reason you are not in a relationship is because you couldn't get any."" I'm by no means ugly. In fact I have a 6 pack whislt he has a dad bod.

And he's been with her for less than a month. He would literally skip lunch or even have 2-5 minutes to eat his lunch just to send his girlfriend back home from school and go back to school again (different timetables). And this idiot would go great lengths to spend all the money with her on food and she ate a few bites before telling him she doesn't feel hungry.

That's not all, they act as if they are a married couple by having to lecture each other on the time they reached home. She got pissed with him for reaching home late because she wasn't able to video call him. Sick cunt.

This was just one instance of simps acting like white knights and putting me down. Another guy from my class laughed at me for spending time alone on outside because I was a lonely loser with no girlfriend. The guys girlfriend posted a pic of her and another guy on her social media claiming the other guys gay but we all know what's she's been doing behind his bad. And to top it off, the girl never posted any pictures of the them on her social media but posted pictures with different guys on it. Not sure what kind of exclusivity this is.

Just to conclude, why do men like these choose to put someone down just because he's not dating or doing his own things? What do they have to gain by putting men like me down?

But what he did tonight...I can't get over it. I am terrorized but I don't know how to get out of here.

We got in an argument about me hanging out with one of my close friends who happens to be a guy. He was jealous that I went to watch a movie with him and it was only the two of us.

We were both shouting and I started crying so I wanted to walk away. We were in the kitchen and he threw a plate and said ""don't you dare walk away from me"". I just froze, I was terrified and I didnt know whether he was going to hit me or break something else next.

But he just got closer, took me by the wrist and said ""understand that you're mine. You don't get to act like a slut now that we are together."" Then he kissed me, I couldn't move or say no but I didn't want him to touch me at that moment. He dragged me to bed and he tried to take of my clothes. I started fighting back but he said ""you don't want to resist, we're just going to have some fun"" and he...did what he wanted to do. I was crying and I didn't say a word but he could see that I was hurting and yet he didn't stop. When he was done, he kissed me on my forehead and asked if I was okay. I just nodded, I couldn't talk and I was too scared of him. I waited for him to fall asleep. And now I am in the restroom shaking and typing this. I can already see bruises starting to form on my wrist.

I think I have come to the point of giving up hope on ""friend"". Whenever I trusted them, they will simply destroy my trust. 

Let's name two of my ""close friend"" C and K. I had known C since young and our parents are very good friends as well. I told C a secret and mentioned not to tell anyone because it is not the time to reveal the secret yet. C agreed to it. However, C decided to tell another person, eventually the news came to my ears. I was shock and devastated at that time to hear such news. The thought of all the trust I have on C simply shattered at that moment. 

While K, we had known each other close to 10 years. I would say I am closer to K as compared to C as we usually interact more since we had quite a lot of common interest. Recently K's birthday is around the corner and since it is K's 21st birthday, I decided to make it something special as a birthday gift. Hence, I did a handmade birthday gift which I had never made one before. With my excitement, I went to Art Friend shop and spent more than an hour to think of how am I going to make a gift out of it (ps I am not an artistic person). Yet, I received a long message from K about K's disappointment in the handmade gift. K feel that I did not put in much effort despite thoughts that count. But to me, it gives me the vibes that K spent more money to buy my birthday gift as compared to what I gave to K hence K is disappointed. On top of that, K even mentioned that I did not spend the time to consider what K would like to have or able to use. K said that regarding my birthday gift, K had spend time to consider what would be useful for me, which to be honest, it is not practical for me. However, I appreciate the thought of K buying it for me and did not said anything. 

Other than those 2 ""close friends"" I have mentioned, I have also experienced abandonment and betrayal from other ""friends"" as well. Is it common to have these kind of friends in the society now? Friends that see benefits in you but once you no longer value, they simply throw you away...

2058,"hi guys, i need advice to REALLY get this message across: birthdays are important to me and when he doesn’t celebrate mine, our relationship takes a serious beating.

i’ve told him those exact words over the past 3 years but it’s really clear he doesn’t get it. we’ve argued over it and i’m always the first to let up because he has a knack of wiggling his way through any convo. 

some background:
over the past 2 years, my birthday has been less-than-ok because of him. the first year a failed gathering which i didn’t even know it was for my birthday until only after when he told me (no one wished me, no cake etc.); the second year, i observed him do nothing at small gathering w fam, he didn’t take charge or help out or contribute in anyway, just existed there where convenient. it rly made him look like a bum.

and this year i thought maybe things would change? not really. i had already lowered my expectations alot. tbh it was really as simple as cutting a slice of my favourite cake with him, or eating something new tgt. but i received a grabfood uncle with two slices of melted cake, which melted even more throughout the day. we both had classes that day so we didn’t plan to meet (apart from a 1 hour class in the morning and aft, i was actually free and i guess low-key waiting for him to show up), although turns out he didn’t even go for his, he just kind of lazed around at home.

he’s part of those ‘birthday-is-just-another-day-and-somemore-i-already-do-thing-for-you-on-other-day’ kind of people, which i really can understand. but if you know i ride alot of hopes on this day and literally any sign that u put in some effort into appreciating me will have 10x multiplier effect today, why is it so hard to just bring me out for nice dinner? or agree to do a small thing that i like to do that u don’t really like tgt?

i believe love is a verb and even though i know he loves me, i don’t feel appreciated or loved.

it’s such a stupid thing to get worked up over and i’ve been trying to supress this disappointment i feel. i guess NUSWhispers is where it resurfaces. so thanks all for listening.

2059,"70940: pharmacy has never been a sun set industry. whenever i go to guardian or watson or unity, the pharmacist is always out for lunch or on break. we lack them actually.

I suggest MPharm program in Australia. a few of my secondary school friends who studied bachelor science in NUS, furthered their studies in MPharm and are  fully registered pharmacists now. Right now sgd to aud exchange rate is very favourable. so tuition is cheap.

MPharm is just two years. Per year tuition fee for international student is 35k AUD. (for example newcastle) so about 70k AUD for two years. If you include total Room and board should not exceed 120k AUD. or 110k SGD


assuming your current pay is 40k SGD per annum now.

you take a two year hiatus. losing out 40k*2 = 80k SGD (lost income) 
you spend another 110k to get your MPharm. so total losses is 80 (lost income) + 110 (tuiton fees and room and board) = 190k SGD

during prereg, pay is sad about 25k SGD per annum.
so 40k SGD (your current pay) - 25k SGD (pre reg pay)= 15k SGD (lost income for the prereg year)

total losses = 190K + 15K SGD = 205k SGD

a pharmacist earn about 5k plus at guardian easily. inclusive of bonuses about 70-100K. we take 70k per annum for calculation

compared to your current 40k. you will enjoy a 70k-40k = 30k advantage. you will take 205k/30k = 6.8 years to break even after you complete your pre reg. 

I would say go for it. however if your current pay is more than 70-100k per annum, not advisable unless you hate your job.

2060,"Is the civil service really a dream job for fresh graduates who prefers work-life balance, job stability and more money (more bonus), compared to working in the private sector? 

I am now working in the private sector (R&D), but have to OT a lot till late at night, and a part of me likes my job because of the good colleagues and working environment, but another part of me wants to earn more without putting in that much of OT if possible (leave my job on the dot). I am quite tired of OT and have been wanting to throw the resignation letter recently, but I understand that a lot of jobs that are offering are now contract jobs and it's the same as my current contract job.

I don't mind the red tape and bureaucracy at work if I can enter into the civil service, but I am worried that I am in a less favourable positions compared to scholars who will always be ahead of me. I just want to slack and wait for time to pass and stay in the civil service for as long as possible till retirement, becoming a deadwood, even though I know that this is impossible.

2061,"Background

Family: Well to do, can say it’s above average

Sister: Just started her 4 year degree in NUS 

Me: Graduated and just started working 

So just last year when my sister knew she will be enrolling into NUS, she begged my dad to buy her a car as NUS is far from home and driving to school will buy her more time to rest and study. It will take her around 1.5 hours to travel by public transport. 

During my enrollment period, my dad also insist on buying me a car but I didn’t kind of like the idea of it as driving in Singapore is not cheap. Petrol, parking, ERP, maintenance, traffic jam, etc... Do note that my dad is an expert and very knowledgeable about cars. So my dad and I had quite a discussion over this matter and I told him if he insist on buying a car, get something economy as I won’t be driving it often (depreciation and stuff like that...) End of the day my dad bought me an Audi R8... I was so furious that I told him off and had quite a big quarrel over it. After that I told him I’ll cover the monthly expenses of the car. Note that I own a small business while I was in Uni so forking out for the car is still within my capabilities. Till today I did not take a single cent from my dad with regards to car expenses. Technically because I don’t drive it often as it attracts too much attention and I don’t want my friends to know I own such an expensive car...

So back to my sister who eventually got my dad to buy her a Range Rover Velar. She have been driving around for 3 months and often borrows my car. I have friends who are still in NUS and told me that my sister would drive my car to school and park it over the weekend for school camps... Is it necessary to pay parking which can amount to who knows how much???

So recently she told my dad that her car is costly to up keep every month and her car consumes lots of petrol and hope my dad could trade in her car for a smaller one. Guess what, my dad told me that she is requesting for a BMW i8 because it’s an electric car... and her main reason is she would want to help my dad save some petrol money... 

Upon hearing that I confronted her with my dad being around and told her the best way to save money is to 

1. Stay in the hall. With that she will be able to get more rest and not worry about travelling time. Then she mentioned she want to be home daily so I suggested her 
2. Buying the train and bus hybrid concession pass which would cost only $85 which was my main source of transport during my Uni days. Upon hearing that threw a tantrum and said that I’m not understanding enough. Take note that my dad is paying for her petrol and parking expenses which amount to approximately $1200 every month...

I feel that a car to her is to flaunt and not as a transport... Since young she doesn’t work part time or have any source of income and only ask my dad for allowance and fund her travelling and hobbies... Am I being unreasonable here? Why can’t she be more understanding and be like any other student who travel to school by public transport/ stay in the hall? Why can’t she spend her own money? Thoughts on this?

Despite laying expectations and understanding, the debate and quarrel usually is about the same thing and for our case one quarrel usually leads to another and it gets worse sometimes.
Sometimes its about replying about 5 mins slow, which is consider slow for her. As my timing is spread out for work,study and personal life,  its very hard for her to understand that most of the time despite sitting down talking about it. 

i have to admit sometimes i do want some time off just to sleep which will also affect her. We do meet up to sleep but weekends are fully planned and all out for dating and all but its still insufficient.

I was overwhelmed with feelings at that point of time and to think of it right now, I’m frightened. Not sure why is it so, because saw myself having a future with him as far as 1 year ago (he’s a sweetheart ever since he started pursuing till now, and also a person I can always rely on) and we’ve also gained the support from our parents despite the age gap. But I’m quite overwhelmed with the things I have to handle, like it’s my final year in uni, we have recently started on planning the wedding, etc and I have so much on my shoulders I don’t know who to talk to. Tried talking to my friends about this, but all they can tell me is to relax, don’t think so much etc which I can understand since they haven’t experienced this before. Can’t open up about this problem to him as he seems extra enthusiastic about this whole wedding ever since the proposal, so I definitely do not want to spoil his mood because of this. His friends even described how serious he was about this proposal. And I am truly touched. Finance is not an issue though, since he has been working for a few years with a decent income and both of us come from quite a well to do family. But I just don’t know, everything just seems so soon and it’s kinda suffocating me. Hais and I’d probably be a mom a few years later, since his mom has been constantly bringing this topic up whenever I’m over at his place. The thought of it is just rather terrifying to me.

2080,"Ever since I was young, my parents would always remind me from time to time that when I start working, I have to give them a portion of my salary, because that's what filial piety is about and I should repay them for what they've given me growing up. I have nothing against that, but my family is well off and my parents definitely don't need any extra money. My (future) salary would be peanuts to them. I don't understand why I should give them a portion of my salary as a sign of filial piety because that would just be giving them something they don't need. Isn't spending time with them more meaningful? 

I understand that to them, giving money is filial piety (they send money to my grandparents overseas and we rarely visit) since they grew up poor. I am grateful for everything my parents did for me and their road to success must have been so difficult but I just wish that maybe they stop seeing money as a standard of filial piety... I definitely have no problems giving them a portion of my salary but I don't understand the rationale behind it if my parents are already well to do.

I would like to advise that you spend more time with him over at his place or anywhere convenient for him when he's not in Camp. Even better still, go out of your way to fetch him when he books out etc. He will definitely be very tired so this is a period where you really have to frequently go out of your way to accompany him. He's in SCS, so there's a decent chance that he should be mature enough to appreciate. It will definitely be a very trying time for both of you, but know that most relationships that make it through NS smoothly will likely last much longer.

From the following post:
Question, is it okay to let your girlfriend meet a guy she knows from a dating app?

Well, she said that it was before we got together and they started chatting since then.
Honestly, I would be okay with it. But she was hospitalised for a week and fulfilling my boyfriend duties, I visited her everyday, from the start of visiting hours till the guards would chase me out. Then I saw a notification on her phone which looks like a dude, trying to get to know her. Asked her about it, and she said ""I matched up with him before we got together.We've not met yet but I don't talk to him anymore."" A week later, she says she wants to go out with him.

Honestly, I would usually be chill with it. But it's just that feeling of betrayal towards your boyfriend. Imagine this guys, getting 5 hours of sleep, buying breakfast from the market before visiting her, staying till the guards chase you out everytime and you found out your girlfriend is texting some guy behind your back while you were worried about her health. That's how your girlfriend thanks you.

What about your opinion on this situation guys? Would this be acceptable?

To clarify: First,she deleted the app and they communicated through facebook messenger. Second, my girlfriend said she told the guy she has a boyfriend. Third, the guy is from NZ, she wants to meet him because she said she promised him to bring him around when he comes to Singapore.

2086,"It is concerning how our society treats porn as a normality. I have been an avid user of porn or in stricter terms, a porn addict, during my younger years and was disillusioned about how sex should be. I started objectifying women and developing weird fetishes such as feet fetish. Like a chain smoker who feels crazy withdrawal symptoms every few hours without a cigarette, I feel an uncontrollable itch to start searching for stimulation on the Internet every time I was alone. The ability to get different stimulations easily with a new tab each time only made my addiction worse. After the usual gets boring, there would always be new fetishes to help me finish. After about ten years, I find myself numb from sex and unable to even get an erection with real women because my mind has become so accustomed to the unreal stimulations of porn that sex felt like a huge disappointment. I was diagnosed with erectile dysfunction about a year ago and have been on a nofap routine till now. My current partner has been very supportive and am really glad the abstinence paid off when my willy finally responded while we were making out last weekend. What I want to say is that for men who are currently having problems getting stimulated from your partner, the problem may not be your partner but rather your unrealistic expectations of sex formed from years of porn addiction? I also hope that parents of the newer generation would take the time to educate their young about sex properly instead of treating it as taboo and have their young learn about them through social media or porn which over sexualizes everything.

Of course on rare occasions we had some disagreements before, but we would always make up and don’t hold a grudge against each other. Whenever we encounter any tricky topics, we would always discuss things calmly and try to understand from both sides.

I guess all i wanted to say is that i used to not believe in finding “the one” who will make you want to say “I want to live the rest of my life with you”. I used to think that i will end up with someone whom i think i can tolerate my whole life and get married to that person just because it’s time to get married.

2091,"I've seen many posts here asking for help on CS modules. Just my 2 cents' worth, from my years of studying and learning. 

[ Background: I'm not a CS major, but I've gotten an advanced degree in pure mathematics. Along the way, I've gathered some tips on learning and some of these may be relevant to CS students, since the two subjects are rather similar. ]

0. Be honest and admit when you need help.

This should be the first obvious, but some students are too proud to admit it.

1. Attempt to clarify at the first sign of uncertainty.

Confusion doesn't come suddenly. Usually you start off understanding 100% of the stuff. However as the weeks pass by, things get increasingly fuzzy, until one fine day you see all the symbols and terms flying past and you're forced to admit you don't have a freaking clue. By then, it's probably not too late (see point 0), but better to start early at the first sign of trouble. 

For that, you have to be strict on your understanding (points to follow).

2. Ensure you can at least site the definitions.

Bloody memorize them by rote if you have to. Some people have said if you understand the materials well, you don't need to memorize. Duh. But apparently you're lost so that advice doesn't apply to you, so you gotta start somewhere. Memorizing the damn definitions is a good start - a slight difference in definition can mean all the difference.

""Every man has a woman who loves him"" is different from ""There is a woman who loves every man"", so get your quantifiers in place!

3. Avoid comparing yourself with others.

Wherever you go, there'd be some hot-shot super star who can ace the class with little (or even no) studying. They're they. You have to start from where you're standing. No point wishing you could be like them, or worse, bear them any ill will. [The latter is the surest way to ensure you'll remain in mediocrity.]

If it makes you feel any better, those super stars will eventually meet their match with even hotter super giants. Also, there're some people who're just star-shaped balloons. Pay no heed to those people; you have your own struggles to deal with.

4. Be humble.

Pride stops us from even starting step 0. No, faking till you make it ain't gonna work when you're dealing with highly technical and precise subjects. Write ""="" instead of ""=="" and see your C program crash and burn. Ask someone. If you don't understand his / her reply, ask again or someone else. 

Grow a thick skin. Ask a question instead of brushing your queries aside. Some people may be mean but most are nice if you're truly out to learn. If you're really that shy, go to the relevant Stack Exchange.

5. Ask questions and state results CLEARLY.

You'll be surprised how much your learning improves once you can state things with clarity. I am forever grateful to a friend in graduate school who, while I was hemming and hawing over a certain bijection, said ""come on, at least you must know one side of the correspondence"". 

Once you force yourself to state things clearly, you can no longer get by with just half-understanding. See point 2: at least get the definitions right. Now state results clearly. Try some small examples. Can't think of any? That's what your peers / TAs / profs are for. 

You may have seen some domain experts discussing with each other in extremely ambiguous terms. Don't emulate them. They know what they're doing. You don't.

6. Be patient.

Once you've decided on all the above and to put your nose to the grind, progress will be slow. Because your old habits will manifest themselves. That old, wishy-washy definitions, the imprecise statements, the fear of looking ignorant among a crowd of smart people... those are gonna come back. But recognize them for what they are. Don't beat yourself over them, but just correct yourself and move on. 

7. If, say, you think you're doing really well, and suddenly you realize there's an extremely elementary gap in your understanding, be grateful instead of sad.

It could have been worse: you could have gone through life without finding it out.


All that's said and done, a concluding statement. True: even if you work hard, there's no guarantee of success. But also true: if you don't work hard, there's zero chance of success. All the best to all.

2092,"It's my final year in uni, I'm 23 and I'm still an evergreen. I had hoped to find a boyfriend during my time here, but I guess that's not happening. It's not that I lack suitors, but I was just never interested in them. Some of my friends say that I'm just too picky; I guess I am, but then again shouldn't you be picky when it comes to forming romantic relationships? Maybe I'm old school, but when I date someone, I'd do so with the intention of becoming life-partners with them and marriage as the end goal. Honestly, I feel the reason why so many people breakup all the time or cheat on their partner's back is because they chose to settle... until someone better comes along. Perhaps it's because they don't want to be alone. Idk I just feel so jaded toward relationships.

My friend say she thinks physical cheating (such as ONS) is worse than emotional cheating because the thought of her partner doing it with another person will never be erased. I myself feel that emotional cheating is worse, because their heart is already with someone else and liking someone else is a constant feeling. Of course, both is bad and it leaves the person being cheated on forever thinking they’re not good enough, but I just want to hear some point of views!

2100,"So I'm an Asian guy and I've been dating an Asian girl for the past year and a half. I'll explain why this is relevant. We've brought each other home and her family was delighted that she finally brought home an Asian guy and we both get along with each others friends very well and both my friends and family have told me she was quite the catch. We've both had a string of partners before, I've slept with about 40 women in total and like most people, I enjoy sex but I've only had sex with my current partner about 2-3 times in the past year. The problem is, my partners have all been Asian while she's an ex-spg. When she first told me I was the first Asian guy, I felt physically sick and nauseous but kept it to myself and thought could get over it but unfortunately I can't, hence the sexless relationship. It's gotten to a point where I find it physically impossible to get sexually aroused by her and brush her off telling her I'm not in the mood. She hasn't brought it up or been affected by it yet as she's very understanding and thinks I've just been not in the mood. I haven't cheated on her but it's getting really frustrating.

2101,"I was asked point blank if I was gay by a long-time straight friend after some drinks in front of a large group. Being still in the closet, and especially with such a large group I laughed it off and denied it. I don't blame him, alcohol makes it easier for people to ask personal questions. Nevertheless, I felt really uncomfortable that I couldn't give an honest answer, and I wish my friend was more sensitive with the whole affair. 

I don't think I've been flamboyant in any way, just that I've never dated a girl despite being shipped regularly, and I've always claimed being an unattractive nerd was the reason why.

I know there are those who say my true friends will stick by me after I come out, and that those in university are open minded, but I'm really scared. I'm scared of how many will actually remain, and amongst them how many will be understanding and continue to treat me same as per before. I'm sorry, but I'm not ready.

I'm scared that any new acquaintances in uni will judge me based on my sexuality over my personality. I've spoken to friends who would whisper to me in a lecture hall about how a random guy sitting a few rows in front is gay, even when I know nothing about him.

I'm scared my army buddies will run from me and see me as that guy who would add questionable stuff to their Milo.

Coming from a boys school, I'm scared that my bros of nearly a decade will see me as someone who might want to hit on them and distance themselves from me and cut off contact. I'm scared I'll no longer fit in. 

Sometimes, I know curiosity gets the better of all of us. I too, want to find out if my eye candy leans the same way. But there are different reasons between when you ask about someone's sexuality in front of a large group, versus when you ask in private. The first approach makes me feel like you just want to expose me to everyone else. But  if you want me to know that you're comfortable with who I am, there are plenty of ways to do it in private, which I think is a good way to build trust too. I won't give an honest answer either way at this stage, but it'll definitely make it alot less uncomfortable. I've always wished I could fit in and be straight like most people, but the reality is this is something I don't really have a choice over. I just hope my friends in the majority can be more understanding, and not to make it more difficult or uncomfortable for those with a different sexuality.

Furthermore, many of the jobs do not require expertise or knowledge pertaining to your degree. A recent news showed that half of Singapore grads find jobs not related to their degree. Goes to show how useless the core modules become when you graduate. Note to self: Memorize your notes, cause you can just forget it after finals.

Some may argue that you will learn soft skills, project management skills, get networks etc during your undergrad course. But you can also learn these while accumulating work experience, not to mention the salary which you can use to pamper and upgrade yourself.

Going to a JC used to be a popular choice for many of those who can. But as the gap between a diploma and bachelor cert closes (in terms of value for money from the perspective of a employer), will diploma be the new favourite? Or will fresh grads widen the gap by pursuing masters?

Because i chased away the 1 and only friend who was a really good friend to me. Let's call the person A. A would always be there to check on me, when I'm feeling down. A would come and cheer me up,to accompany me, to eat meals with me. So things got better for me, I became less hard up on myself, starting being more sociable and was happier.
But me being me, I indirectly chased A away due to my insecurities.
And now , things have worsen to the point where I laugh at myself everyday. I laugh at how pathetic i actually am. Ever since A left,  there was not a single day where i have people asking me out for a meal or to study together or to even check up on me.
And now, Im slowly having really negative thoughts. I imagined myself on the highest floor of the HDB, looking down, perfect image of everything ending in less than 10secs. And i imagine turning around to seeing friends behind asking me not to do it. But obviously no one was there. All i could see was my parents, and if it weren't for them. I probably would not have lasted until today. Although I don’t tell them anything, just spending time with them makes me feel happy. And i dont want them to feel the pain, and i also want to make sure i repay them for all they have done for the past 20plus years. But everytime I imagine them leaving,  I see myself leaving too. Because there’s no one else who really cares about me, or be even there for me. I once had a change of mind when I met A, because finally there was someone who wanted me to be a part of their life,  for the first time in my life, I felt loved by someone other than my parents. In my mind all I could think of was that, someone finally is gonna stay despite my problems and insecurities. But things don’t always  go the way we want it to, and things ended on a bad note between us. 
Everyday I live with a hurting heart, like it really hurts and the pain is slowly killing me. And its getting really tiring coupled with the stress level in school. 
Ive tried getting to know more people, but people just assumes I’m there for an ulterior motive. Either that or most people already has a close group of friends, and no matter how I try to talk to them, I just get left out or forgotten. 
This is really wearing me out, more frequent panic attacks, lesser sense of belonging, and im really sick of everything. 
Maybe it is really time to end everything soon

Did you truly understand the answers? Or maybe you copied codes for missions I guess, so your programming skills hardly improved over the course so far. You won’t find another module that provides so many pyp for you to try out. If you knew you aren’t good in doing the papers, you would’ve practiced more, try out random code tracing problems by yourself, ask tutors, etc.

Yes, there will be those who are better cus high IQ/ started learning python before university, but these ppl make up a low percentage. It’s not like these smart people only exist in cs1010s anyway, these people exist in most modules. Even many of those who who started ahead in python struggle in cs1010s. So the point is, just put in a lot more effort if you really want your A. Else, too bad, just SU then. If you carry on with this attitude complaining about how hard the paper is, you will be suffering in the rest of your uni life.

Bosses love to spread malicious rumours about staff and backstabbing amongst colleagues is SO common. Colleagues also refuse to help each other or share necessary information. Outwardly, the department presents a caring and inclusive image; but inside, it is really just a hotbed of Medusa-like activity. 

I go home feeling miserable every single day and my only solace lies in the pay which is fantastic, even by SME standards. Recently, I got another job offer, but the pay and the position are lower. I will need to reply to this job offer by the end of this week.

My parents have been convincing me to stay put in my current job because of the pay (getting a pay rise next month) plus the prospects it gives. Maybe it's an Asian parent thing but they also feel like my pay gives them ""face"" in front of our relatives. This makes me scared of letting them down. They also tell me such toxic behaviour are in every workplace so there is no point in quitting. 

Please advice as I am extremely conflicted if I should make the leap of faith in leaving.

It was pretty crowded so I shared the table with an old lady, to which I saw she was pushing her husband (I assume) in a wheelchair. From his looks it seems like the uncle had difficulty speaking. Then I went to queue at the chicken rice stall and the auntie queued at the fish soup stall beside, I then overheard this conversation in Chinese:

Auntie: “Hello, 1 fish soup please.”
Guy: “$4.50.”
Auntie: “I want rice can?”
Guy: “Auntie you want 2 rice is it?”
Auntie: “No, I meant I want the soup with rice.”
Guy: “Soup comes with rice lah.”
Auntie: “Oh okay sorry.”

Then I saw the chicken rice stall guy was laughing at their conversation. Not only was the guy taking the order quite rude, his friend was laughing. 

Don’t they realise that they’re working in a hospital where generally people don’t come here unless they have relatives or friends in need of hospital care? I mean I get that life is full of sh*t but come on have a little sensitivity, it’s not like patients visiting the hospital isn’t finding their life hard enough. A little professionalism can help make people’s lives easier. Quite sad to see this really.

2154,"Long post ahead. 

Every now and then, I see short guys expressing their frustrations and worries here. Height has never been a deal breaker for me. It is just a more visible trait  which may not be very important in sustaining a relationship. There are more practical considerations that women ought to start thinking about and I wish to illustrate these with my dates. I’ve dated a couple of guys who are taller than me and three guys who are shorter than me. 

Some of the taller guys had lower qualifications and also earned less. They told me they preferred someone who earned lesser and is more dependent on them. I was way too independent. These relationships did not work out because they needed to conform to the societal expectations of the man being the main or bigger provider. 

Another of the taller guys was a dessert chef in training and would often bring me desserts for supper after work. Still, this did not work out because we did not belong to the same race and our families were against the idea of us being together. 

The second last taller guy was a financial analyst. He is well-travelled, well-read and also well-fucked. We did not progress beyond our second date as he was insistent that sexual compatibility was the most important thing to him. He offered to be my “mentor” and suggested that we should not waste time if we are not sexually compatible. This did not work out because we had different priorities. We ran into each other some months later. He said he was engaged but still looking as he was not sure there wasn’t someone more suitable. I was glad I dodged a bullet. 

The last tall guy was confident, successful and smart. He also had a habit of canceling our date at the last minute. I felt like I was the backup plan and did not wish to be waiting for someone who did not prioritize me. 

Now on to my shorter dates. 

One of the shorter guys was a staunch Buddhist. He tried too hard to convert me into a vegetarian and insisted that I try meditation. When I rejected him, he sent me many messages about how he could not stop crying. Pretty sure I dodged another bullet there. 

The other shorter guy decided to turn up unshaven, with dirt in his eyes for our date in town, in a really old T-shirt, shorts and slippers. He then had the cheek to advise me that women like myself who are taller than average (I’m actually only in 160s) ought to dress in a way that make ourselves appear more petite. I wondered if I was in a set-up in some reality tv show about nightmare dates. 

Then I met my husband. I am about 10 cm taller than my husband but it did not bother me one bit. We are compatible in more ways that I can imagine. And one thing I’ve noticed is that he tries harder than any other guys I’ve dated and never lets his height limit him. He does more than his share of housework, he cooks and bakes better than me. He is committed and puts in effort in dates. 

I can’t speak for all the women but I would rather be in a relationship with someone who understands what it takes to sustain a marriage than with who is taller but doesn’t pull his weight.

I am sure there are men who are tall and good looking and put in effort too. These are few and far between and probably all snapped up by equally rare women the minute they are available on the market.

Start looking beyond the appearances for hidden gems!

Earlier this year, before we got attached, one of my good friends from my JC (who is also in my course) told me he liked her. At that time, I already knew I liked her and that she also had some feelings for me. But at that moment I hid all these from him because I wasn’t comfortable sharing. 

However, after seeing my friend go out with her a few times, I decided that I had to act, and went to confess to her directly, and that’s how we got attached. 

Now, me and my gf stopped talking to my friend altogether, and my gf kept assuring me that it was the right thing to do, because she eliminated him fair and square, and I have already fell out with him since. 

Right now, I’m quite content with the state of my relationship. But I want to ask how to prevent my former friend from spreading about what happened and ruining my rep in school, and whether the way I got together with my gf was wrong. I feel that it isn’t because all is fair in love? At the end of the day, I won her heart and he didn’t what.

I guess you can say that I am a bad influence - you have became more calculative and wary of people compared to the past.

I was clearly not your best choice... and you already knew that I was someone full of issues. Despite everything, we stuck together for many years. Most of the time, you were the one protecting and loving me. You never gave up.

But I can see the change in your feelings now. Recently, I’ve became depressed. I talked about death. You have always hated my negativity so I guess.... this is a new level. I can tell that you are trying to avoid me. You rather be with your friends and family.

We have tried to talk abt this, but it never worked out. You’ve clearly reached your threshold. Maybe you do not even want to be associated with me anymore. That’s okay, I guess. With the failures in my life, I will never be good enough for anyone anyway. Even my family do not care about me. All they care is about flaunting achievements. When I share my feelings with them, they scold me for being negative.

When I worked at a restaurant as a server in the past, I would come across so many customers who don't finish their meals. Some of them barely touched it. Sometimes my manager will ask them if the food is not to their liking, but they would just reply by saying they are already full. 

It's funny because they ordered so much food that the dishes are filling up the entire table. 

Please don't order/ask for so much food if you can't finish it. And if you have too much food on your plate, please share it with your friends/family/neighbours. Don't waste food. 

This is not because someone else across the globe is starving, but because many people worked very hard to provide the food for you (think - the farmers, chefs/hawkers, your parents, your helper). As a consumer,  you don't always see how hard it can be to prepare the dishes but it can be a tiring process. People say throwing food away is a sinful waste and therefore an immoral act. I think that it's more immoral to disappoint those who have invested so much into making something for you. 

Sometimes when we bring the unfinished meals back to the kitchen to throw it away, we try not to let the cooks see them because they get sad. 

I hope this resonates with some of you. Thank you for reading.

I'm 2nd year out of university. Salary about 6-7k a month before CPF deduction. I can't BTO on my own. But buying 2nd hand HDB is economically so much less worth it as an investment compared to the private market. 
A normal private condo even the 1-2room kind now is like at least 1million. My salary isn't enough to loan more than maybe 500-600k on my own?

What’s more, I am from a Polytechnic, meaning that I have some background knowledge in programming which is suppose be beneficial. It doesn’t help me at all despite that.

What's up with writing all these stuff that make you look even more like the ""strawberry"" that your elders have already assumed that you are? Get a life. No wonder these people are single.

Also, for your own sake, use a profile picture that looks decent. I have seen one too many pictures that look like advertisements for prostitution (i.e. baring too much skin or posing like a ""chicken"" looking for hookups).

It seems that (most of the time), females nearing 30 are the ones taking such apps seriously. Please, for everyone's sake, screw off from such apps if you don't intend to take on a serious relationship.

Until I came to uni and realized I don't genuinely like anyone I meet ???? it's like I can make conversation when required of me, but it's bothersome to me. I don't have many friends that I can turn to (just a few cliques here and there), since I don't find joy in small talk and superficial hi-bye friendships, and hence hardly reach the stage of building deep relationships with them. Also, when I meet new people, I see things that I dislike in them super quickly, which makes me not even want to try to befriend them. lt doesn't even have to be a whole personal encounter for me to come to such a conclusion, a short few seconds would do. One reason could be that I think I tend to see through people's intentions very easily and hence don't fall prey to all the fakeness going around? Or maybe it's that I just don't have much love to spread around lol all exhausted on my family and bf? 

Since wide connections seem to be very important to succeed in life these days, I do often reflect on myself and wonder why I'm like this? Am I really that bad of a person? I guess trying to judge less and learn to accept and befriend people that seem different from me is the only solution, but I just feel fake doing it. Any suggestions on how to improve myself?

Your not the only one with that problem. I once had a partner who would deliberately (and always) pretend to not know things or get names and details wrong just to seek attention. Eventually, I grew tired of the unhealthy behaviour, as well as the perpetually need to correct the person’s mistakes, and went ahead to initiate the break up.

It felt wonderful, super liberating in fact! :)

Anyway, my point is that you need to be able to see yourself spending the rest of your life with the other party instead of allowing others to mislead or misguide you. For your case, please trust your judgement — only you can tell whether she’s the right partner for you.

2210,"After 3.6 years of relationship, I recently broke up with my boyfriend. In the first few years, I was really into him and serious about the relationship. I wanted to marry him after 2 years of dating and hinted to him but he didn’t take any action. I was quite disappointed with him, especially about our financial plan and savings. 

As the years go by, I realised the things we want in life are no longer the same. I love challenges and travel around by myself (because he doesn’t want to join me or not interested) , and he is an idle person, stay at home and like a coach potato, not keen in exploring new stuff. I know something isn’t right in the 3 year of relationship and asked my friends whether is it normal that sometimes I didn’t miss him and forgot to text him when I was traveling. My friends told me it’s normal when you are busy and don’t think too much. I tried to find back the love we had but unable reconnect to him. I just hold on to it....I didn’t realise “it is the time to let go” until I met someone else who is younger and fun who I can connect to. We chat and talked a lot stuff (he flirts with me but I didn’t take it seriously). In a way, the existence of this new guy makes things clearer that I have grown apart from my bf. So I broke up with my boyfriend and I told him I need some time to rethink of this relationship. Breaking apart would make things clearer. After breaking up with him, surprisingly I feel relieved and guilty at the same time. Guilty because I hurt him and wasted his time. He tried to chase me back but i rejected. Things didn’t turn out nicely as he was quite a jerk, took back some expensive stuff he bought for me... Anyway those fancy stuff doesn’t matter to me, so that’s alright.

My friends know him as the “Mr Nice” and my friends think I betrayed him for someone else. Because the existence of this person and I broke up with him? I still feel bad for him and friends think I am a bitch, heartless. There is nothing much I can do, as I can‘t explain and don’t think they would understand. 

I still chat with this fun guy I met. He knows I broke up and decided to chase me. My friends (not-so-close) advised me to find someone who is financially stable - build a family and stop wasting my youth and time on this guy. He is 5 years younger than me but somehow we can connect and I’m genuinely happy when I’m with him. He asked me out for dating and I’m still hesitating. One side of me want to hang out with him, know him better but another side worried that i might hurt him. He might think that he has chance. I worried that if I let this continue and we might not be compatible in the end (maybe because of age gap and financial status) then I will hurt another guy. 

Should I accept him to go dating or look for someone who is stable? I’m very lost, all the time. Am I thinking too much?

Fast forward, in one night we became fwb and every time we saw each other we were suuuuper horny. He did ask me if we could try dating. I said no almost immediately. The ending was so bad, that he rejected me in bed. He said the guilt would eat him alive as he still likes his crush. Wtf reason is that? The rejection in bed killed me. I was so so so so so sad. The most painful thing is, we are in a clique and we have to pretend nothing happened.

Our relationship is not the same anymore, we don't text individually anymore. Even kinda awkward when we are put together alone.

2218,"My thoughts on dating apps.
We're at a time where modern dating is complicated. Right now especially, we are objectified by people via social media. We post on instastories because we want people to say what we're doing, we post pictures on instagram, waiting for likes and comments. Deep down we're seeking for external validation. We're in an era whereby we swipe right because this person is good looking. Hopefully has a fun , interesting personality and hope all goes well. We get out, meet this person, have fun and hopefully, we'll be going out on a 2nd date, 3rd date and so on. But in the midst of all these fun conversations, it's become normal to date others. It's normal to say ""hey, I really had a fun time with this person, but let me get more swipes, go out for more dates and see how it goes."" When either party finally expresses interest, the other says ""I'm not too sure. But let's just hang out and see how it goes."" 

But in other words,"" Hey, you're a pretty fun person to hang with, but let me just date more people, if I find a better person, I'll stop dating you."" Isn't it pathetic that we've been objectified by others who we have interest in and vice versa. Since when are we not enough but want more because of the plethora of dishes that is laid in front of us. Why should we be objectified by others. Why should validation be expressed by others, hoping that we're good enough when they're already interested.

I am going to make sure her life is well taken care of if she wants to be with me. That’s a huge driving force to realise my ambition and to give her extremely good life only one can dream of.

It is fated definitely. I don’t rmb much for other girls except her. She is the only one I can rmb so much. This will be my ultimate driving force to succeed. The power of love and my desire to give her the best life

2234,"I cheated on my boyfriend because i lost the spark between us and there was another guy who was being really nice to me. I know everyone will tell me to breakup with my current bf because i dont deserve him etc etc, yes i brought up to my current bf that i wanted to breakup because i had been seeing another guy which treats me way better than him. I told that to his face - i like someone else and wanted to dump him. He  suddenly became possessive and obsessed over me, it went by in stages, initilly he begged and tried using pity to get me back, when that didnt work, he resorted to threatening me to reveal that guy and used words like 'i wont give you peace or 'u cant escape from me because youre mine'. He almost resorted to violence and said he would kill himself and me so no one could have me if he cant

BY doing this he is further confirming that i did the right thing to dump him, but im also afraid he would harm the ppl i love. At this stage dont give a shit if he suicides as long as he leave us alone.

What should i do?

2235,"I'm a girl in a relationship with a guy (we are long term friends)

Thing is, I am attracted to girls; I got together with my guy friend because of how well we clicked. Like I do feel that a relationship is also about whether we can do life together and our understand of each other is really great...rather than just sexual attraction.

Recently, I met a girl who I fancy, and I know that she fancies me too. I told my current partner about this, and he told me to ""be who I am"" and chase her (and we would remain close friends). 

I feel uneasy about this. I would have normally done so if I were single, but I can't help shake of the notion of 'cheating'. Plus, life in this relationship has been great; we can understand each other really well. On that basis, I'm not sure if I ""should be who I am"", because that's not fair to him.

Should I stay?

Standing by the exit of A1E just past 9am this morning, that dark moppy hair only served to further accentuate your smooth, fair skin. I guess you would be what others conventionally call a pretty boy - the only thing that could be fairer than that radiating skin would be the cream white jumper hiding your broad shoulders lean frame, nicely complemented with your dark grey (or olive green? or black?) bermudas that showed off those legs which deserve every attention.

But what was most attractive was the look of brooding - first on A1E, then at The Deck - your lonesomeness only served to make your more endearing. I suppose you are one of those who will always be swarmed by aunties and neighbours with extra snacks and a pinch of your fair cheek.

2243,"I have encountered some issues with my wife. I am going through a sex deprived marriage like many did. The problem is, we are married for less than a year. We did have sexual encounters on and off before our marriage for the past few years and every single time it was great. Around 1 year prior to the wedding she requested for hiatus and her reason was she did not want any ""accident"" to happen. I though she was right and fair so I obliged.

We did not ""consummate"" on our wedding night as I was semi KO'ed by the liquor when we reach the suite. The next day we had to check out by noon so there was no chance for anything kinky to happen. The same night nothing happened as both of us were still exhausted. The following night I initiated but was shrug off by her ""I'm still feeling very tired, can we do it another day?"" So I thought why not give her another few days of rest before I try again. I did not ask again till almost two weeks later and was again shrug off by the ever familiar reason ""i don't feel like"". I didn't say anything and turned towards the opposite direction and fell asleep shortly.

After weeks of facing her rejections, I brought up the topic of sex deprived marriage to her. The conversation didn't last more than 5 minutes and ended up pretty nasty. During the conversation I brought up to her the potential issues of a sexless marriage. It was pretty clear that the message not only did not get through but at the same time backfired. She said that I not being understanding and demanding. I then asked her ""if I don't turn to you for sex, who should I turn to?"" She kept quiet and the conversation ended.

We did not have sex till 3 months later and it ended within 10 minutes. There was almost no foreplay, just touch, pump then cum. To be honest, I couldn't feel any love from her. And then the same thing happened again whenever I try to initiate, the SOP Reasons ""I don't feel like, feeling tired etc"". My frustrations grew strong as the days went by. When I could no longer hold back my frustrations, I confronted her. She then told me that she's no longer interested with sex but wouldn't mind if we are planning for children. At that moment my mind went blank. Completely blank. Mind you, both of us are only in our late twenties and she has already lost her sex drive. To make things worse, she's a looker and when we are out, married men never fail to lay their eyes on her. In the eyes of those envious men, they must have thought how lucky I am. But the truth is, I am suffering.

Till date I have yet ate outside although the thought has crossed my mind countless times. Partially also due to the fact that some of our relatives have divorced due to cheating/3rd party.

I know there are already such threads but I thought it would be great that I could share my own and have others reflect that there are ""worser"" scenarios. Feel free to share your opinions. Any tips to remedy my situation is very much welcome

1. While I was doing my industrial attachment in year 3, I happened to meet a senior who had just graduated and was working at the company for about a year. He’s the kind of guy who has his good looks hidden behind his glasses. He has a calm demeanour and is really nice and friendly. He’s quite buff and strong, and i heard from colleagues that he still goes to nus gym to work out. I didn’t approach him and just treated him as a crush. I regret this so much. I should have approached him but i don’t know how and what to do. We were in different departments so i would occasionally pop by the floor his department is on to look at him. I decided to try to work out at nus gym maybe to see him and strike up a conversation. I went almost daily to try to find him but he only goes on saturdays. Every saturday i will try to find him at the gym but recently his disappeared. and i’m no longer on my IA at the company. here’s my first question: How can i find him again?
2. i usually am quite active on snapchat. the people who add me are close friends and they know about my crush on the senior. One day i went to a department store and saw a girl being quite close to my crush. I don’t know if she’s her girlfriend but my heart was crushed. i knew i stood no chance because he looked very happy and she was quite pretty and tall. i took a photo of them from far to post on snapchat to say that i have officially dropped out of the race to get him. After a few hours i realised the posts on my snapchat were screenshotted several times. i panicked because it was something quite private. and i felt so stupid for putting that online. I found that it was girl A who had screenshot and decided to go on her instagram to see if she posted the screenshot on instastory. long story short, i found out through some stalking that girl A was actually a close friend of my crush’s girlfriend.

I'm a recent Computing graduate, and due to our family's financial problems, I agreed to pay for the tuition fees of my younger siblings' university and polytechnic education. However, even though my brother did not do well for his A-levels and highly likely couldn't qualify for Biz or Engineering, much less CS, he decided to ""follow the trend"" to choose courses in CS in his application. He's interested in subjects such as algorithms, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, computer graphics, and cryptography from things like video games and cryptocurrencies!?

I advised him to choose a more realistic course option he could enter but he refused, saying it was either NUS SoC or NTU equivalent or private uni equivalent. I showed him statistics that IGP for SoC had rocketed, so it'll be hard for him to get in even if he attempts however many times he can during NS. At my wits' end, I threatened not to pay his uni fees if he went the private route and he rebutted me by saying he will work part-time to fund his own education.

A few years ago, I started befriending a guy, James. James reciprocated my interest to be friends, and he even showed more interest than me. Like me, James was lonely without close friends. The friendship was very enjoyable. However, at some point, I started finding myself being irritated by James. 

Am I socially awkward? Is this the reason why I was dumped by my close friends, because I did things to prevent myself from being irritated and I irritated them instead? Is James socially awkward too? Is this the reason why James is also lonely without close friends?

James and I remained as friends, though not as close friends. I was still irritated by him and I started irritating him too. The friendship felt really toxic. At the same time, James had another friend, and the situation was similar to ours. James and her used to be close, but at some point the friendship became toxic.
Recently, James’ friend decided to end her friendship with James. I was inspired to end my friendship with James too. Coincidentally, James has just found another gal friend and is enjoying his new friendship. He is optimistic that he has finally found his true friend, while I am skeptical about it.

Now I feel tired and lost. Should I continue searching for friends or should I stop trying? I am waiting to see if James' new friendship will last. If it lasts, maybe James is right, I will just have to find the true friend for me.

But he did say things like he was thinking about me etc, but I just replied with a HAHA because I did not know if he was joking or being serious. Also, time was a factor as I felt that it was weird a guy would say such things when we only knew each other for 5 days. I took him as a friend and found no harm sharing, and asked him how his weekend went and stuff. Then, on fifth day of knowing him, we left the event location together when the event ended. Then I realised that while talking, he kept standing very close to me and tugged at my hand in the process. I felt that he's trying to have some physical contact with me and did feel a bit happy, but I didnt shoo away from him. I am not sure if he is using that to try to test if I am interested in him? Then, after that day, he stopped texting me and when we met again during follow up event, he did not talk much to me and did not leave the event location with me anymore. I could feel the change in him, but what I am vexed about is why that sudden change? The change was really huge and sudden that I can’t even find any reason for it. Looking back, did I do something that irritated him after that day of physical encounter? I don’t think I did because it was within such a short period of time. Or is it that he is just trying to find physical comfort in someone? Anyways, I realised his horoscope is Aries and not sure if this is how Aries guys act around girls. Need some advice on possible reasons he behaved this way and is it an Aries thing?

2277,"When I was in my 2nd year of IP, I met my first love. Lets call him Atticus. Atticus was the perfect guy: Sweet, handsome, and charming. I really liked him alot, and he reciprocated. Unfortunately, I was young, naive and didn't really think through my actions. Also, Atticus was a teacher in my school, so it was logistically difficult to meet. Eventually, the pressures of having a secret relationship stressed me out too much, so I decided to break up with Atticus. 

Since then,  I have gone out with various guys: some casual flings, some serious relationships, some FWB arrangements. Some of the guys that I have dated include a famous-ish youtube celebrity and the son of one of the crazy rich families in Singapore. Surprisingly, even though many of the guys that I dated have better stats than Atticus, none of these relationships ever lasted for more than a few months. I just never felt anything for any of these guys. 

It took me way too long to figure this out for myself, but now that I have, I am completely sure of this: Atticus is the guy for me. I was foolish to break up with Atticus. After all, we lasted well into my fourth year, which is way past the halfway point of IP.  I should have endured just two more years. I should have given our love a chance. True love conquers all, but I was not brave enough so I threw it all away. As things currently stand, it is difficult for me to get back together with Atticus, but it is also difficult for me to find happiness with any other guy. In theory, since I am now certain that I love Atticus, my mind tells me that I should try my best to get back together with him. Unfortunately, my heart is too cowardly to make the first move. I guess this is the story of my life: because I am stupid and scared, I am fated to continue one meaningless  relationship after another until I eventually die alone.

In early days of social media, it’s exciting knowing what people are up to, but over time, I get really sick of seeing people posting stuff obviously just for the purpose of showing off, seeking validation and fishing for compliments. It disappoints me that even those people that I respect and look up to also resort to doing such things nowadays. 
Even worse, upon meeting the said individuals, they will question me for my inactivity on social media. What’s wrong with not wanting to share every little details of my life with people I barely speak to in real life? What’s wrong with not being interested to take and share photos of those Instagrammable food or places? They just can’t seem to understand. It’s scary that one of my friends even label me as “behind society” due to my lack of social media updates.
Anyone feels the same way about wanting to disconnect from social media or at least go on detox for a while? Seems like young generation nowadays can’t live without social media, wondering if i’m the only odd one out haha.

My mom is 43 years older than me while my dad is a whole 46 years my senior. Recently, my friend’s mother passed away. She was only in her early forties. Ever since, I keep feeling like I don’t have enough time with my parents. To put things into better perspective, my mom is 63 and my dad is 66. The earliest that they can enjoy life is when I go out so work, which is at least 4 years later. (We are a low income family so my parents cannot afford to retire before my brother and graduate from university.)

I’m so afraid that I will lose them before I repay them. My parents spent all their life slogging their guts out for so little that they’ve never even owned a passport. There are so many things that I want to do - I want to bring them on trips etc but right now I’m nowhere near my goals. I am so afraid and I just want to give them as much as I can now, but as an undergrad with little savings, my hands are tied.

2286,"When it comes to relationship matters, do you believe in fate or do you believe that it is something that will be in your favour as long as you work hard for it?

My ex-boyfriend and I parted ways exactly 2 years ago while he was on an exchange. It was that one fine day when he decided that our lives had turned boring and he doesn't sees a future in us anymore. Prior to that, we were together for going 7 years. As much as I wanted and tried to hold him back, knowing him, and wanting the best for him, if that was what his heart wished for, I'd let go because I want him to be happy and I believe that love come in many ways. 

The immediate 1 year after the break-up was a lonely and self-recovery journey that I was forced to undertake. Earlier this year, it has come to my realisation that I've put everything behind me, even though I'd still think of him from time to time and have been constantly reflecting on what I could have done better for my next relationship. As I'm introverted and do not meet new people in my daily activities (I'm already in the working society), I've turned to cmb, hoping to find that someone.

Throughout the past 1 year, I've met a few and have ghosted a few (I'm really sorry), it became more apparent as times go by, as to what kind of guy I'm looking for and want to spend my time with. However, I'm still single today and am still in the search for that 'perfect' guy even though I know nobody is perfect. Honestly there are a lot of desperate guys out there, if I have wanted, I'd be attached right now. However, I don't want to get into a relationship just for the sake of being in a relationship. I hope the wait is worth it and I hope the guy I'm waiting for comes soon :(

Have recently met this guy (from the app) which my heart pounded a little for, even though I've never met him in person for interactions yet (actually not entirely true because we both recognised each other at the start of the convo as we were in one of the same tutorial classes back then when studying in uni). However I felt that he doesn't feel the same for me. He'd normally replies after a few hours (eg. at least 4 hours after my last reply), even though it was a lengthy one (like what they say, sometimes hot, sometimes cold). Based on my experience of such convo, I know that he will one day stop replying soon. That brings me back to my starter question, do you believe that I should resign to fate?

While having the drink, he invited me to his room that night but I rejected. He confessed and explained that he's not looking for ONS but rather want to seize the change since he stationed in overseas. As I have no feeling to him at that time,   I politely rejected but agreed to keep in touch after he's back in his country. 

Since then, he has been texting me everyday for the past many months. He shared his personal stories, what's happening around him etc while I slowly open up to him. He's a mature, smart and confident guy, successful in career and excel in life. But what changed my mind is, he can see through who I am.

I do think that I have a feeling for him, but I just don't know whether I can accept his way of handling  relationship. When he was young (like 10+ years ago), he used to date multiple girls at one time and sometime one day fxxk few girls. He  even shared with me the experience that, some girls he doesn't like as they asked to buy branded stuff after sex.  Even now, he can easily chat up girls and girls often offer to give their phone number to him. All these were what he shared with me as we texted and somhow I do believe them. When chatted with me, he doesn't really touch on the sexual thing. Even during the one or two times when we're on such topic, he'll stop immediately when i showed any uneasiness. 

My concern is, with all his history, and the nature of LDR, if it happens, what this guy wants?

2294,"To OP #70401:

I was in the same boat as you a few years ago and ended up initiating a breakup with my then bf. Perhaps our circumstances might not be exactly the same, but let me just share some thoughts based on my experience.

Texting other girls might seem harmless, perhaps they are really just friends, but do look at the bigger picture as well. Has he been giving you the same amount of time and attention as those girls? For instance, my ex used to claim that he’s perpetually busy at work, and that he’s no big texter. He hardly texted me, so I felt really cheated when I found out that he has been engaging in a lot of casual  text conversations with other girls.

Perhaps he is not telling the truth about them just being friends, who knows maybe they knew each other from dating apps, which are so easily accessible nowadays? Especially since you mentioned he has new girls to talk to every now and then. Very suspicious, how is it possible that he can make so many new friends (and all girls) within a short period of time? Since he said they are “friends”, maybe you can try asking him how he got to know those “friends”, then observe his reactions. You can even jokingly ask him to introduce you to them one day. If he sounds hesitant, turns defensive or blame you for having trust issues, most likely something is going on. At this point, if your insecurity bothers you so much, and if he’s not cutting down on those texting habits despite knowing that you feel uncomfortable, I suggest you just leave already. If you choose to stay, just pray hard that you will somehow find out the truth (if any) before it’s too late. In my case, one fine day my friend saw my ex bf’s profile on a dating app, alerted me, purposely initiated conversations with him and asked him out to test his reactions, and the rest was history....

I think the biggest red flag is that he hit on other girls while giving the impression that he is single. Once you know of this, it actually no longer matters that he claims that he is serious with you, having introduced you to his parents etc., because hey, his behaviour totally shows otherwise! Please don’t just accept his words of reassurance blindly. In my case, we’re already discussing marriage and I was just waiting for him to propose. When I caught him cheating and confronted him, he told me it was because actually he still wanted to explore and not ready to settle down! Well, why would your bf market himself out there as single if he’s ready to commit to you and only you? Seems like he wants the comfort of having someone to always fall back on, while at the same time still wanting to fool around and perhaps looking for better options out there. Please don’t waste your time and youth on him, there are still a lot of guys out there who are more deserving of your love and care and will treat you as priority and not a spare. You might be tempted to stay in this relationship due to the fear of being alone etc, but once you let go, it actually feels very liberating. Been there done that, and eventually met someone who is better in every way, able to address my insecurities and never leaves me wondering whether he truly loves me. 

Apologies for the long post, I wish you all the best in making up your mind and hope you will eventually find your happiness.

2299,"Hi, 

*lengthy post ahead

I am currently a year 1 student in comp science (part-time) from a local uni. Just a rough background of myself, i came from an engineering diploma from poly, and am in my mid 20s.

Recently I have the thought of dropping out from the course and apply for an IT course in SUSS instead. Reason being: 1) it does not have maths/engineering related modules as compared to the local uni, modules were IT related. 2) local uni's workload is much more and fast-paced, bellcurve with full time students and I would say I'm generally not a fast learner. 

However the business IT course focuses on mainly a specific area of IT (The degree course is quite a niche area I guess) hence Is it advisable to go for it or would a comp science degree is better as it offers a wider range of job opportunities? Currently I do not know which area of IT I would like to dive into hence I chose Comp science degree so that it allows me to explore the various options while studying in uni. 

However recently as considering my age factor etc once I graduated from uni, would it be wiser if I take up the SUSS course instead as it allows me to build my experiences in it and also to allow myself to kinda just force to try ""grow"" interest in it?
As the modules in Comp science are quite general and by the time I graduated, I might not have the ""in-depth"" skills to allow me to build my experiences in the area I would like to dive in.

What should I do?

A: change course to the SUSS course immediately, which the sch will starts in Jan, or in July.
B: stick with current local uni course, in the meantime search job related to the suss course and work there to see if I enjoy that area of IT. (Bt this could means I will miss the Jan intake and would have to join the July intake).

Thanks all for reading!

For most part of the trip, meals were included, except for one particular lunch. The prof recommended a restaurant, and as a class we went there together. I think I’m the only one who knew of my classmate’s financial situation, and because of that I noticed that when ordering, that classmate ordered the cheapest item on the menu. Some plain fried rice which was half the price of what most people ordered, and a bottled water which was like a third the price of the other drinks we ordered. Then most of us also ordered desserts to share among our cliques. Penny pinching classmate did not order and did not share any dessert.

After the meal, the prof paid the bill and asked the class rep to collect $xx from everyone. Prof said to the class “Since everyone had a meal and a drink, and desserts to share, let’s just make it easy and divide equally, ok?” I glanced over at the penny pincher, and saw the face just fall apart and went black. It was pretty haunting. But well, no one spoke up. Class rep went around collecting money, penny pincher paid up with the darkest face I ever seen on anyone.

The both of us had taken the mod alone and so when we met for the first time during tutorial, we paired up and I've never felt so comfortable talking to a guy before. But sadly the moment was short-lived and he actually attended my tutorial time slot just for a make up class so I wouldn't actually see him again.

Fast forward to the next tutorial, HE WAS SITTED THERE and in my heart I was like this must be fate (ok yall confirm like walao liddat also fate but lemme have my moment LOLS) and so once again we paired up tgt and class was really enjoyable because the both of us are just two damn blur sotong making a fool of ourselves while everyone had their shit tgt. Then came to the end of class and I was actually quite sad becus the prof had told him that he can't continue to change his tutorial to this time slot again as it wouldn't be fair for the other students so it was really going to be the last time i saw him again :'( 

So after class ended he started to ask me which course I was in and all and he offered to walk me to kent ridge bus terminal via one of halls (he stayed there) as he insisted that it would save more time than the usual route so I agreed (I know sounds abit shady but IDK why i agreed also) but yah nothing happened sorry to disappoint HAHA. Then at the bus terminal I was actually hoping he would ask me for my ig or something but he didn't and we just bade our farewell.

2 years later (I'm in year 4 now),  when I was about to leave a restaurant, he came in with his gf/fiance?(Machiam a kdrama you mei you) and we actually made eye contact and I wondered if he recognizes me but I just left becus it would be even more paiseh if he didn't know who I was and I just go crash their date.

Glad that he is doing well and I am also doing well just that I am still a single pringle.

2314,"I have an issue with the new 'A Culture of Respect and Consent' mod. Throughout the course, it is evident that the course is biased in favour of female students. While I appreciate the single sentence in the beginning that mentions consent and respect should be given to all, regardless of gender, I find it disappointing that the examples provided in the scenarios are oblivious to this.

In all scenarios except the one involving the homosexual couple, why does it always portray men as the perpetrators, and women as the victims? If NUS truly wants to enshrine the idea of consent and respect, I think it wouldn't be too difficult to include just 1 scenario in which a female student asks a male student for consent.

At the end of the course, it's surprising that the course urges us to ""not support misogynist pop culture"". What about misandrist pop culture? 

Granted, the reported cases of sexual harrassment on females far outnumber that on males, but is this a fair justification to dismiss the small but existent number of male victims? I think this shows that while NUS tries to market this as a course for all, it is unconsciously biased in its portrayal of harrassment. Ultimately, it shows that society values the consent, modesty, and privacy of males much less than that of females.

2318,"Need some advice here!!!

Am currently working in a startup with a pretty cool team of around less than 10 people who have come and go. I like my team and am grateful to the founder for having me onboard, supporting my work and growth and helping me build my resume.

However, recently found out the founder has been filming girls in bathrooms. I don't know if anyone else knows, especially my team. There are less girls than guys in my team, but overall I'm just wondering if they know and are turning a blind eye to it or genuinely don't know.

How should I deal with this? Quite disturbed by what he has been doing, wondering if he has done it to his own employees like me as well. All this while he has always been about supporting women. Didn't expect him to turn out this way...

But I don't know if I should quit the team knowing all these. On one hand, I think his work is ok. I believe in it!And there is potential for the startup. All the investors seem interested and trust in the founder and his people growing skills (we always highlight our ladies in the team). But on the other, how can I still work for someone that is such a trash human wrt to basic things like respecting privacy. To me now it feels like he is tokenising us women and using us to further his own agenda for his company. Yet I don't have clear evidence and what if the other people in the team know but are still working with him because they are separating his work character and his other characters? Should I consider his values as a decent human being to decide if I should still work here? People always say separate work and personal life but should this also be separated? Would you work for such a boss or would rather leave or even more, hope his company dies? Please tell me what to do!

Same! Convos between me and my crush are mostly academics stuff... I usually want to try to keep the convo going but as she is from a different clique as mine, I'm not exactly sure what she likes to talk about, so it's hard. Partly also because when she asks questions, I assume that she's studying so I don't really want to disturb her too much with my replies (especially that it's recess week now)

Might be similar for your case (although the roles are swapped). I think it's possible to tell from his replies if he finds it annoying. Maybe initiate a non-academic convo if you know what topic you both have in common. It might just be that he doesn't now what else you want to talk about and can't get the hint.

Literally, anyway, I am sure this relationship will last. I spend a lot of time and effort to build up this relationship and she definitely reciprocate it. 

She likes to study but because of her family background, she comes here to work and to earn as much as possible to bring back home. That sympathy and empathy , even though she never said it out , these 2 weeks , i know she is definitely really happy being with me.

2336,"I've been doing some soul searching for the past week. 

So here's the story. I've been together with my gf for 6 years already and we have just proceeded on applying for our BTO. Both of us graduated last year and She has a stable job, earning a salary of 4.5k while i decided to pursue my dream of starting up a business which i've basically used up my entire savings on it and hence, my income is not stable. 

We've argued several times on the BTO topic as i feel that it's too early for me to decide on something which is going to be the biggest purchase of my life. She's been talking about how long we needed to wait for the BTO to complete before we even start paying for it and by the time it's completed, my business would probably take off, hence i shouldnt feel that's its too early. I eventually gave in and we proceeded in applying.

So, few weeks after applying, she suddenly brought up the topic of proposing, how her dream proposal is like, the venue, ring size, how many banquet tables etc etc and she's hinting that i should do it next year. 

This made me feel that she really doesnt know my financial situation which in turns made me more stress. What makes matter worse is that she talks as if i would be the one paying for  everything.

So, few days ago, i asked her if she had some spare cash( which i obviously know she has and its quite a big sum as her family is well to do and is still giving her pocket money despite her earning 4.5k/month) and if she wanted to invest in my business. She gave me a wtf look and just brush my topic aside. 

Also, recently, i've just made a huge discovery that she is still thinking about her ex, to the point that she goes to their ""frequent"" location, hoping to see him. Note that her Ex had blocked her on all platforms, so she isn’t able to contact him. But remember guys, I’ve been together with her for the past 6 YEARS!!

So now I really don’t know how I should be feeling. My feelings is a complete mess, esp since we already applied for the BTO.. I don’t know what am I expecting to read in the comment section, but oh well, if you have any opinion on my situation I’m currently in, pls feel free to comment.

2341,"Thinking of having children but just can’t trust your man that he won’t meander into another woman’s arms? Here is a practical advice that would pretty much gurantee he won’t deviate cos he risk losing too much. The more he is experienced, the more he will be afraid to lose you. 

If you like a man and you don’t want to lose him, hold on to him using your third hand. For life. 

Pre or post marriage whatever. The cert should hardly matter to you if you find the right man. The strength of your relationship will be determined by your ability to grab and hold him with your third hand.

Forget abt all the preaching of “holy” people who talk so much but in the end are hypocrites with secret affairs behind their “holy” significant other. Nah, I already have it distilled down to a science while people still think sustaining marriage is some kinda wishy washy hoping with faith. 

Guys are like kids that needs to be held by the third hand all the time so that they don’t lose their way. 

Also forget about all the crazy techniques in bed you saw as video and all the nonsense you ever saw or read and thought, ‘that would please a man in bed’. Those are like hollywood action shows, it would be a painstaking effort with little return. 

The only technique in bed that u shd be concerned abt is tightness. You are on the right track when it becomes clear that he would sell his soul to live another day with you on earth. Doesn’t matter how experienced he is before he met you.

Jade pigeon eggs. 

Your ancestors can thank me later. I need all the positive karma I can get to meet my wife the next life too. 

-from a guy happily married to a wife for ten years with a kid and have literally zero interest in any other woman. All that confidence. All freaking plastic bags. 

P.s.- YMMV, since attitude in life and character must match first or his life will be a perma BDSM of “hate her mind but love her body too much to leave”

His brother has a girlfriend who literally treats my boyfriend's house as her own. My boyfriend and his brother both share a room together and she will always come in, play and sleep inside their room. Because of this, my boyfriend has to camp at his living room until she leaves the house (usually around 12-3am). She too moves furniture around and the boys had to shift everything back again after she left. Although my boyfriend and his parents are totally not fine with it, sometimes ranting to me about what she has done, they are not the confrontational type. 

One time, when my boyfriend's parents went overseas for a few days, she  came over, brought food with her boyfriend, without buying any for the youngest brother who has special condition. When my boyfriend came home from work, he saw the two of them eating in his room together while the youngest sat outside. After preparing dinner for the youngest, he told me how the youngest actually ate very quickly, something he would do when he's really hungry.  

As much as I am annoyed, I know I'm not in any position as an outsider to interfere. I could only give my opinions to my boyfriend to do something about it (since he is the oldest). But to no avail, since they are not the confrontational kind as mentioned, sigh pie. When I ask her about it, she conveniently cited the fact that she is mixed??! I'm pretty sure this is not a racial issue lol. 

Besides treating the place like her own territory, she too has something against me. EVERYTHING, I repeat, EVERYTHING is a competition to her. From studies, to achievements, even planning to get married. Lol. But that's a different story altogether, we'll just leave it at that. 

I just wish someone in that family would do something about this, when they are clearly not ok with this. Or hope that maybe she would grow up and be more considerate someday. Idk. I'm just uncomfortable with this situation.

That’s when I came across a forum for pick-up artists.  It’s exactly what I’d been looking for.  It seemed like a cure for my autism.  I watched all the videos I could find.  I started working out at a gym.  I’d spend all day approaching women.  Soon I was only hanging out with other pick-up artists.  They respected me.  They wanted to learn from me.  Finally there was something I was good at.  

Right now I have over one thousand numbers in my phone and had sex with 20+ woman.  It’s a bit like gambling.  Sometimes it goes well.  Sometimes it doesn’t.  But you always have the chance for sex.  There are so many tricks to learn.  

Women have emotional brains.  They get addicted to feelings.  You can use that to your advantage.  The first time you meet her—tell her she looks amazing.  But never give her a full compliment again.  She’ll always chase that validation.  It’s like a drug.  Tell her ‘she looks beautiful for her age.’  Tell her ‘she looks good in this lighting.’  Keep her insecure with half compliments.  Keep her feeling like there’s something wrong with her.  Like she’s not good enough for you.  Like she needs sex for validation.  

Of course it’s manipulation, but why should I care?  I’ve been manipulated so many times in my life (bankers, sales, MLM, corporate boss etc).

Will require some genuine career advice. I always had interest in a certain field and had been working in this field after I graduated in May. The job scope (sales related) is not something that I like, and I wasn't able learn much valuable knowledge about the field from the job. It is, however, a full time job and I truly liked everyone in my job. 

I recently got an offer for a niche role in the particular field. It's a role that I think I will learn and grow a lot more in the role. It is a 2 year contract role, and I am not too sure if there will be much job security in this job.

On one hand, I am feeling guilty now for leaving a job with nice people, especially so when they are facing a period of uncertainty and things are getting busy. On the other hand, I feel that the other job will give me a chance to learn more about the field.

Would like to seek genuine advice on whether I should switch jobs. No trolls please :)

Recently I was invited for a Interview in one of the Big Telco giants in somerset for a Sw engineering Job. I was representing a recruiting firm

The HR was supposed to be the point of contact and I called her after reaching,  I was early by 30 mins and she clearly said can't  come now in a rude manner. I was waiting in the lobby.

She came and registered in the lobby it seems and gave me a visitors ID card in hand. From this point to till I left the building she never spoke a word. 

Interview was delayed by at least 20 mins and even then she didn't utter a word. Then comes the ordeal , Job description and my resume never matched and the interviewer did not seem to be interested to conduct the process and so was I and He just came out of the room and he was having discussion with his colleague and did not even say a bye. 

Disappointed and came home  and next day is where it turns out to be fun. I forgot to give the visitors card purely unintentional and now the HR wants me to go to their office and Give. 

I did not think twice to say NO even the recruitment agency. But they  had constant check on the returning the card. I threw it away the next day. 

All this happened 20 days ago and yesterday the agency guys whatsaped me , you pay 50 SGD fine or its a police case. Reason was any one can enter their office now .I was amused and said clearly I wont pay and I threw away the card and agency seemed to threaten and I said clearly I wont pay if need be let me answer to the police. At last Agency guy said he accepted to pay the fine.  

May be I will said as a cheap guy in the comments but I did not do anything wrong from my perspective and neither did the agency. Just because the HR is from the mighty Telco , The person is so demanding.

1)HR did not speak a word or give Any instructions on where to return the card when she gave me. 
2)HR did not escort me out post interview.

I don't mind paying 50 SGD and making peace but I feel If I pay then the mistake is on me - Your genuine thoughts please.

2353,"""Friends shouldn't expect anything in return."" This was the phrase that really broke me during our final arguement. After spending so much time helping you, it really hurts. It's funny that we could within a year go from coursemates who don't talk, to bestfriends and now, to strangers.

Everything was perfect at the peak of our friendship. We stayed up texting through the night sharing our deepest secrets and spending our day in school like two peas in the same pod. We did literally everything together, we were like a couple but better - We were besties. 

However, things started to fall apart after our finals. You formed a new clique, I felt insecure and jealousy grew. Was I too boring? Did I do something wrong? Fast forward to this week you refuse to even go out with me alone. I then understood everything when I looked at your new clique. You found the bestfriend you wanted, a girl. The only issue you had with me was that I'm a guy and you're a girl. No matter how hard I try, no matter what I do, I will never be able to match up to that new bestfriend you found simply for the fact that we're of a different gender. 

To my Ex-Bestfriend Lynn, it's simply too tiring for me to try anymore. It's becoming unhealthy for me to constantly have you on my mind. I fought hard with you and for you but sadly I have lost the battle. I'm sorry for being a difficult guy to deal with and I thank you for all the time you spent with me. For now I will go back to being that nerdy virgin who will be forever alone. Waifu for laifu I guess.

2354,"Happy belated birthday to you. This year, we won't celebrating your birthday together but I am always hoping for your good health and always be happy like usual you. I was holding on longer than I should because I still wish that things might really change one day. I trusted you for so long even in the midst of our problems and arguments but only to find out that you meddling with my trust. This time, I am letting everything go because you made me realized that I should deserve something better for my future in which I decided to move away from you for the benefit of both of us and for the well-being of both of us. Despite all the problems that we had, I forgive for everything that you have done wrong to me and I braced and lower down my own pride to ask for your forgiveness because at that time, I believe maybe we would do better in terms of our relationship; but I know it will end like this.

Here I am, finally choosing myself over you whom I liked and loved before and falling in love with my own life by breaking our bond. This is me to let you know that I am no longer to fight over your attention again and no longer to look back and look forward upon you from far and only this time; I craved for the distance from you by quitting myself away. So, cheers to you and to both of us for allowing other people to enter our lives and nurture us further into life. And thank you for stopping by and leaving a big mark. I don’t have any regret on it, instead I am thankful to you because if it weren’t you, I will still become a weak person who depended on you like last time to keep myself strong.

This is my final farewell to you and I am hoping that I won't see you again in future, let us end everything.

2355,"I am nearing my graduation years and I am stuck at a crossroad here - whether should i be idealistic or realistic? I have a passion that i am always working but it is something that does not exist in Singapore as it is very theoretical. During my exchange, i am able to do a research project on it despite not having any formal education in it as i learn everything by myself. I am now seriously considering whether should i pursue a phd on it instead of my engineering degree but this will mean that i will end up jobless in Singapore should i come back. This means that i have to give up living in Singapore as the only jobs i can get will be overseas and i will have to compete with insanely smart people around the world which i may not be able to. So should i trade my engineering skills that come along with easy and comfortable life with something that i am passionate about but at the cost of highly competitive, difficultly, low guarantee of success and less than 6 hours sleep?

Once, my mum moved some of the furniture back to the original spot. When she came back and saw the furniture, she just took her bag and left without greeting my parents. Also doesn't help that she treats my parents like invisible on a daily basis and usually stays in the room without interacting with the family.

Back then, I used to hang out with this pretty attractive girl. Different girl from my previous post. Slender body, nice smile, and fair skin. We’ll head out to movies and dinners. Frequently in movies, she will ask me if I’m naughty or not. She likes to place my hands on her thigh, inching closer by the minutes, when it’s not even a horror movie. Thereafter we went to take a stroll, she pointed to me an inexpensive hotel, asked if I would like to spend a couple of hours there. She wants to do ‘it’ with me. I looked at her in amazement, in disbelief that this very day arrived, not on a stormy night wherein the movies, people seek shelter but a freaking random weekend. I joked that there isn’t a 7-eleven nearby, so it’s not going to happen. But in fact, I already spotted one while we were strolling. I can sense her disappointment, her urge, that she can conquer the night, she was more prepared and mentally ready than me getting pumped up for a 24km march. You tried being pro-active, hinting me with your scantily clad attire, of how beautiful your legs and body were. It’s not that you’re not pretty, or not attracted to what you have to offer but it’s just that my ‘Guild’ needs me. Still, I’m sorry…glad that you found someone you love now

At the company I work at, there are a number of colleagues who do not have the relevant experience, yet they are placed in a higher position simply because they suck up to the boss/bosses. 

And how do I know that they lie about their work experience? Because it shows in the way they talk to other colleagues. The questions they ask. The way they talk to clients over the phone. 

My question is this: how far can bootlickers advance in their career, when they do not have the relevant skills or experience to sustain themselves at the job they are placed to do?

I can’t imagine myself pumping a XS one even if she’s what others consider to be perfect. However I have been forced to hide this from my circle of friends as they always ridicule XL girls. I end up calling these girls mean names in front of my friends to fit in, and it pains me deeply inside. To make things worse, when I’m around a girl I find attractive, I get so anxious. I can’t even look at her, and end up doing all kinds of stupid things and saying disrespectful stuff to her.

There’s one girl in particular. We are on the same pokemon go team, and she has this really cute face (a bit like whismur). My heart races so fast I feel like I’m getting a heart attack whenever I hear her voice (she’s pretty loud and expressive so you usually hear her before you see her). I think we’re really quite compatible, with similar playstyles in pokemon go. Furthermore, because of the game, I will get to see her quite frequently. But alas, I’ve blew it yet again by always being overly mean to her such that I believe she despises me.

I've liked this girl for a year plus, and just when I felt that I was ready to confess, this acquaintance of mine in the same course added me as friend on insta. So I thought why not accept, and it turns out that he was dating my crush for a year. I was shooked, cos me and this girl were quite close, we had shared quite a lot on our personal lives, but she had never mentioned to me that she had a bf.

Fast forward to now (about half a year since I had learnt the fact), I had already made up my mind to move on. But I am still lost, confused and slightly hurt. Obviously I had not moved on completely (hence this post). Also, I don't think she knew I had feelings for her because  she still keeps in touch with me, and treaed me like she would treat a friend. But she has no idea that everytime she is nice to me, it would both lift my spirits and kill me a little. I have no idea how to treat her now. I wouldn't let her know about my feelings cos I know I would definitely be rejected and it won't do either of us any good. Should I slowly distance myself from her or should I continue treating her as a friend?

I deleted my Instagram when I broke up for awhile and didn’t bother to contact any online friends then. When I reactivated my social media, she would leave lots of comments on my igstory even if I didn’t responded. I decided to befriend said girl since I realised we had some common interests. This is the part where it gets weird, sometimes I would mention experiences shared by my friends without mentioning any of their names and she seems to know exactly who I’m talking about. She let it slipped once by accidentally mentioning a name. She seems to know about me more than she is disclosing. After hanging out for slightly more than a month she confessed that she chanced upon my pics 3 years ago on the explore page on Instagram and has been attracted since then. She also admitted to having followed my private twitter, Reddit, basically every social media I have under other usernames/throwaway accounts. She has also confessed that she wants more than a friendship with me and proceeded to pin me and forced a kiss onto me. Since then she has been slowing letting me know that she has actually been wildly stalking me and she admitted to stalking all my friends as well to know more about me. I’ve rejected her advances since the day she confessed. When I started seeing one of my friends and she found out she wasn’t happy about it. She tried to talk me out of it and told me that I’ll never find someone better than her. We had a talk and I decided to cut her off. Today, my best friend told me that he is going to make things official with a girl he has been seeing secretly for awhile. To my horror, it is THAT girl. He told me that his gf was bent on meeting his only female best friend, me. After meeting her she pulled me aside and told me that everything she is doing is all for me. Someone help me.

Been browsing on Instagram, sometimes I see Instagram Story advertisements. Things like careers in financial advisory, setting up an e-commerce shop, and other stuff, but those are not what I want to ask about. 

What I want to ask about are overseas internships. I have seen story advertisements from Absolute Internship and Capital Placement which talk about overseas internships in places like the UK, Spain, and other places not Singapore(though SG is a location). Looks good on paper: Work overseas and experience life as a pseudo-local there for three to six months. Might be a good resume bulding activity. Sure, it will not be fun and games like SEP, but it might be a stepping stone to either a full-time opportunity at the SG branch if no desire to work overseas and if they have one, or a possible ticket to a long term working pass overseas.

Inputs welcome(if this gets posted). Would also like to see if Centre for Furture-Ready Graduates can provide input. Come on, CFG, do your thing.

Every single time without fail when we go movie, dinner meet up I paid for everything and you never mention anything about to pay any cents back. I just wanted you to be happy and enjoy the times together. 

Just when I tried the third time and confessed to you yesterday, you rejected me so badly and even ignored all calls and text till now.

True enough, not every woman is receptive to the idea of her man having female acquaintances/friends. But, I am always responding to every conversation that involved female. For instance, replying with a heart shape or a few sentences on my Instagram. Occasionally, I might hang out with a group of female friends for dinner. Until she broke down, I decided to call for a stop. 

Then, I went on with a sex massage to satisfy my needs. Coincidentally, she found out I cheated behind her back and requested to end our partnership. I begged her to give me another chance and she agreed but I could tell she would not be the same her again. 

I can tell everyone that I did not penetrate them but who is going to believe me? I regretted my actions and I really hated myself for my unfaithfulness. Losing myself to lust is not someone I wish to be. What is important right now is earning her back. However, whatever approach I used, it all seems futile to her.

She’s not fat, just a bit plump but I think she’s ok. She did lose about 20kg over the past 9 months, so I think she wants to maintain her current weight. But I feel that she’s doing a bit too much.

It also seems like she’s doing some funny gym stuff instead of like running or weights. She said she has spinning classes and silks classes every week. Like wtf are those?! I’m starting to think that she’s becoming so foreign to me and is no longer the girlfriend I once knew. I’m reconsidering if we should even get married now.

2404,"Why does he love me? 

I would be fooling myself if I said, because he can appreciate my ""essential being"". Maybe that is a tad idealistic. Kind? Humorous? Beautiful? That is not unique to me, and I can easily be swapped out for someone else. 

This is the internal thought process of a non-feminist young woman in campus, who does not condone sex early on in a relationship. Kindly follow my line of reasoning. 

Repeating the question, which is very simple, 
What is the basis for his love? Because me loving him is not enough, he has to value me too, or else I won't be happy! 

Many romantics believe, love is blind, love is irrational. No wonder there is also a term such as hopeless romantic, which indicate a sense of letdown by reality. 

In most cases, the natural instinct of the opposite gender is to rush into sex, unless he is irrationally noble. There is a frenetic sexual energy at this age where nothing but biology is to blame. 

Do you love yourself, or do you seek validation from instagram likes and size of following to prove your social value based on a painstakingly curated glory hole constituting of vacation photos and perceived popularity? If that is the case, do I attribute his love to my parents for funding my life (and my phone to access instagram)? 

What is your identity? Do you believe yourself to be smart? Do you think of yourself as creative? Do you see yourself as strong? Or special in some inexplicable way? 

Does he see that? 
What tangible things do you have to show for yourself? 

Has he had many long drawn out, thoughtful discussions to know you on a mental level? No? Yeah, who has time for that anyway? We are all living alone on our own for the first time, in most cases, and we need instant remedy for our loneliness and neediness. 

To cut the long story short, we could possibly just be another random person without deep, meaningful and specific contextual relevance to them. All you have to offer him is sexual favors. That might be the reality. And you are better off abstaining than to be an unpaid worker. 

So cultivate some self-worth, individuality and focus on personal growth and achievement, rather than investing emotional energy into a gutter, through laying your insecure, eager to please/accommodating self at their mercy when they leave you feeling ""abandoned"" and worse than where you started. Ain't worth it. Save yourself the unnecessary heartache/drama.

We hit off quite well in no time, since we share similar hobbies and similar tastes in japanese things. We also spent a lot of time having deep conversations and met up regularly to eat. Surprisingly, he agreed with me on a lot of topics I thought was controversial and not many would agree with. In no time, we became best friends and whenever there is a jio we will only go if  both of us are going. 

The next thing I knew, he got attached, I wanted to be happy for him and I congratulated him but i was quite upset and  angry that i wasnt the first to know about it. He didnt even tell me anything about girls or that he had someone he liked. Because of this I gave him the cold shoulder. Not like he actually cared, since he has a gf now. But barely a few days in, I kinda missed his presence and how we used to share with each other our deepest secrets. Seeing him and his gf flirting around so much also made me really uncomfortable. 

Anyway, I made some other friends and this girl N showed me some BL manga. At first i was quite shocked at the contents, is this how hardcore bl is supposed to be? But i found myself enjoying the manga and even asked for more recommendations. And when i met J again, i couldnt help but visualise him and me together. I think im gay for him. But he is a hetero and i dont think its going to work out since he has a gf. So i gave up on him. 

But now, he broke up with his gf a month ago and came back to me for company and we started talking alot again. I told myself that I need to stop this toxic r/s cos my feelings are growing even more as i spend time with him. But I cant help it whenever our hands touch or he pats my head when I got a A for my essay. 

This is our final year and I dont know what should i do... should i confess or should i just leave this friendship and stop torturing myself with this feelings? advice needed please.

A few months ago, my dad confessed to me that he was having issues with his marriage. For obvious reasons, as his daughter, I can't directly help him. Even so, it hurts me to see him so unhappy, so I tried to indirectly help him, e.g. by organizing a family dinner in a fancy restaurant and pretending that I have some last-minute assignment so my parents can spent time together. I also advised my dad to try his best to communicate his issues with my mum in a clear and effective way. For a time, I sensed an improvement in their relationship. I was very proud of my dad and his willingness to make an effort to save his marriage. 

Unfortunately, my mum dosent share the same positive attiude. A few months ago, my mum told me that she was thinking of divorcing my dad after I graduate. I am totally disgusted by how toxic she is and how she is willing to give up her husband and daughter without putting in any effort to salvage the situation. I find it even more disgusting that she pretends to be concerned about my graduation as an excuse to guilt trip me into taking her side in the event of a divorce.

Well, guess what, we know all your tricks. We are making preparations. When the day comes, you will not get a cent out of my dad. Goodbye and good riddance.

Hey, bb, I'm sorry for giving the cold shoulders recently. I simply didn't want to strain our rs further because of issues like this, moreover, we will get married once I graduate. I've decided to reply you via this platform since you know how I always fire my thoughts out erratically whenever I lose my temper. So I'm doing this, calmly atm.

Believe me, from the moment I dated you, I understand your love for cars. I saw how much you enjoy being behind the steering wheels, be it learning how to drive, the first time you actually drove me around for dates and to this point of time, deciding whether to own one, has always been your lifetime dream. But I just want you to know that it isn't ez to own one in SG. Not only the depreciation is insane, you still have road tax, insurance, petrol, maintenance fee etc. I'm not doubting your ability to own one, I believe you will, but it isn't the right time now. No doubts your salary is remarkable for a fresh grad, I'm proud of you if you don't know, and I know you will be paying off your tuition loans very soon, but we still have the wedding, honeymoon, our flat etc, and I wouldn't want the car to add on to your financial burden.

Maybe wait a little longer for me to graduate, find a stable job and for us to settle down into our new flats before owning one? By then, I will also be able to share the burden with you and hence, give you my 100% support. Pinky promise? You know I don't break them.

You don't have to worry about me. As you know, I'm either heading to school, home or library. And as for our dates, I'm totally satisfied with it, just that final year has been tiring me out, hence the lack of enthusiasm. My apologies on that but to let you know, I still love you, okay? I've spoke to my dad a few days ago and he is willing to lend you the car when he is overseas. Otherwise, we can rent one occasionally on the weekends. So are you willing to compromise? Text me when you are ready to talk about this topic calmly alright?

There's prof that went thru at most 50 slides per mod and I have to multiply that with 5 mods. Imagine that!!!! I'd say I'm a relativity slow learner, I can only learn fast provided if the concept make sense to me. However rn atm, I'm forced into H2 bio (I only got till sec 2), h2 maths (I don't even have amaths) etcetc and I'm constantly burning the midnight oil everyday and still a lot of the concept taught still don't make sense to me. Idk I'm probably dumb or sth. I'm really questioning myself if I should withdraw cause fyi, I got into the major I'm in rn because it is almost similar to my poly course, so I assumed it would be easy for me to enter uni (but i never liked the course). Side note when I was in my last year of poly, uni was never my option, I just told myself that if I'm able to make it, I'll go, if not I'll just work. However idk what's up with me, Im probably insecure of my future and didnt wanna lose out cause lets be real here, degree holders are everywhere, not having one makes me lose an edge nsixiakxjwks. 

That leads me to think, whether or not should i withdraw, I feel thay uni is really not the place for me, everything here is so overwhelmed, I'm not enjoying school like how I used to. I'm not happy. Constantly stressed out. Not having enough time although I've sacrificed my social life, and burning the midnight oil. I feel that I'm better off working. But people kept telling me that for a poly student to get into uni, it's not easy. I shouldn't make such a impulsive decision and regret later. Maybe I should try out one sem and decide after that. What do you guys think? Degree over happiness or the other way round? For me it's happiness but still degree is so so so important in Singapore. Sighhhhhh. What should i do now and is it true that it is hard to fail in uni?

I have been single and lonely af for all my life. But in recent months, I got really close to this girl who is on exchange here (not nus), who I got to know through mutual friend. We started texting increasingly more frequently before she came, and since she came to sg last month I have hung out her about 15-20 times already, about half of those with our other friends, and the rest just 2 of us. Recently I even brought her to my house once at around 10 pm, we had dinner with other friends but she waited till everyone left before she agreed to come and visit (my parents were at home).

So were basically super close and still texting multiple times a day, everyday. But apart from sharing stories about her private life (she has been single for some months), we have not been physically intimate. I once hinted that we could be together, but she brushed it off jokingly. But I'm sure she knows that I like her. 

The questions which have been troubling me are: 
1. Given the above, is it time for me to share my feelings with her? Given how we lack physical intimacy but are already super close, is it still possible she just sees me as a good friend? 
2. For those who do not think it's the time yet, what hint(s) should I look put for? How can I further hint her?
3. How do I put it across to her in a way that would not creep her out? The last thing I want is to lose her friendship or even start seeing her less.

I appreciate all genuine inputs or suggestions, and I sincerely hope there are no troll comments here (there are many other trashy posts here for that), please help me out!

(I also hereby promise to post an update here of what happens after I eventually share my feelings with her- for good or for bad.)

I've just graduated last year and found a job related to my degree, receiving a salary of 4.1k, which is the average salary of people with my degree.

So, my fiancee and I have BTOed, currently waiting for our flat and our wedding ceremony will be held a year later, after she graduates from uni. Since I came from a much humbled background as compared to her, my family and I would usually take the public transport, or at most grab/rent a car on rare ocassions. Since I'm currently working with a decent salary, I've decided to purchase a car so that it would be much convenient for everyone and I can bring her out on dates more often too. However, when I told her about this plan, she doesn't seem to understand things from my POV. She mentioned that we will be spending lots of money on our new flat, wedding dinner, honeymoon, my tuition loans etc and the car would be a financial burden. Basically she hates the idea of me owning a car, despite giving in to her by choosing a cheaper car. She mentioned that owning a car in SG is equivalent to burning money away since it's COE only lasts for 10 years, hence the depreciation.

Okay, so everytime we get into this topic, she just doesn't seem to give in and we have been in this conflict for about 2 weeks. And I'm honestly so fed up. She knows that I love cars since young and owning one is my lifetime dream. I'm super lost right now, how should i convince her to let me own one?

She became cold towards me lately, even coaxing her with food doesn't help like how it does in the past. Although she doesn't ignore me, I can tell that she is very unhappy by her attitude through the phone or irl. I did not expect her to react in such a way since she grew up from a rather wealthy background and travelling by cars were her go to. But she mentioned that she didn't want her parents to support her after we get married. I really don't like to see her being unhappy, but I really want to own one car.

2445,"I honestly think SMU has better control over their student than NUS. This year both NUS and SMU had their Business Orientation Camp differently. 

SMU is very concerned about their reputation and its Office of Student Affair closely collaborated with the organising committee to ensure that their students had a wholesome experience, this is given the condition that the students had the freedom to carry their phone around. They even banned games that may make the participants feel uncomfortable such as red black which may include questions that related to sexual activities. 

Unlike NUS which had it differently. Their students were told to pass their phone up and only allowed to use their phone during meal time. The reason being is that they don’t want the participants to take any stories that are deemed as inappropriate by the public. However, they are still told to play games that involved sexual activities. There were several complainants who felt uncomfortable during the games and resulted in them not being able to bond with their group mates. Just because they are seemed to be less fun.

2447,"Hello, 

I’m in NUS year 1 right now. 

However I’ve been feeling down lately for quite a while. My Girlfriend broke up with me almost two years ago and we were together for 4 years. 

I’ve been going out on dates for a year post breakup but it’s not helping.  Most of the time there will not be a second date afterwards. It’s difficult to initiate a second meetup when the girl I’m out with doesn’t seem like she’s better than my ex.. 

It’s been almost a year since I last went on a date, I don’t think I’m bad looking.. I’ve not been able to bring myself to kissing another girl/sleeping w them. 

Deep down I still love her but she’s not ready for any relationship ( I’m not sure if she meant it ) at this moment, I’m diverting my attention on work and studies.

It’s really tough, it’s taking a toll on me. I’ve to agree that I’ve crushes here and there and it will probably help me move on if I’m able to date them but I do not have the courage to try - I fear rejections and I know for a fact that I shouldn’t rely on flings as distractions.

But whatever it is, I still love my ex and if I could I would still date her and accept her for who she is. 

Please advise me on what I should do. My savings are not that high hence I’m unwilling to  go out on dates with other girls unless she’s my ex, because she’s the only girl I’m willing to spend whatever cash I have to see the smile on her face

Thank you for hearing me out, apologies if the sentence structure isn’t up to standard. I just poured whatever was on my mind

Lastly I believe I’ve changed for the better. I’ve been more understanding, open minded and loving.

Then I started noticing that the comics she’s been reading on her ipad are also gay comics. I know she’s into japanese comics but I never realised it’s this type of comics. A couple of times when I peeked over her ipad there’s full on guy on guy action with uncensored dicks and buttholes. And she wasn’t really hiding her ipad from me. I also noticed that sometimes when she’s reading comics, she would rub her boobs or touch her crotch. I don’t know if she even realises it.

What should I do? Should I ask her about her comics? Should I be worried about anything? I’m so weirded out that I’m at a loss.

If there was an opportunity, I would like to apologise to you face-to-face for the lack of professionalism and responsibility I had displayed close to 3 years ago because I was considering suicide after facing a huge “betrayal”. Being given the chance to lead a team of capable individuals was the saving grace while I focused my attention on work and recovered from there.

Thinking back, that guy doesn’t deserve such a response from my end and I did regret considering him as my dream guy. Thank you for asking me out for Saturday outings as we were too casual for dates. That helped me to understand that he was not the only guy that could be considered.

A few years ago, I ask the Lord who will be my life partner and that evening itself, I saw you twice on church grounds during dinner time. It would be interesting if it was arranged by Him though.

Life has definitely been very different for us for the past few years and I was led by God to visit the group that you are leading currently which is quite amusing despite the situation I am facing now.

Currently, I want to be with a guy who views me platonically and I doubt I can see myself dating anyone else until the birthday on 2021 has passed.

If He wants to use your group as a place for me to heal from my past hurts, I will gladly accept it and endeavour towards His plans for me.

Do take care of your health and your parents’ well-being for this season. God Bless!

2457,"I've always found many complaints here on NUSWhispers to be quite uncalled for but this is something I've felt become more and more intolerable over the past 3 years in NUS. (I'm a Year 4)

Study spaces used to be abundant but now, major study spaces are taken away from us.

1. CLB Level 4 Computer spaces. Back in AY1617, that used to be my favorite study spot as the tables were spacious and the PCs there meant I could not bring my laptop for the day. The fantastic location also meant that I could conveniently drop by there for a quick study sesh between lessons especially when I’m travelling between FOE and FASS. There was even a printer right there which meant I was spared a trip to the inner printing room on the same level. After that sem when the place was closed for renovation, I was definitely disappointed but not to the extent of frustrated.

2. SCALE + those reserved non-air con tables at ERC.
That used to be quite the secret study spot, which meant that it’s less crowded than usual. Plus the seats were comfortable. After the actual office closed for renovation and they started occupying those outdoor seats, it was sure frustrating to see that no one from SCALE was using those tables but the reserved signs meant us NUS students couldn’t use them, especially when the other table areas are PACKED.

Now, AY1920 is truly the year of BEEF as 3 major study locations were suddenly taken away from us again.
Now, I understand that CLB is undergoing renovation which is eventually going to serve us students well. However, it boggles my mind as to whether the university facilities management even considered where are the regular CLB users going to relocate to, if The Study @ ERC AND YIH are going to be taken away too AT THE SAME TIME? What’s worse is that these 3 study spaces are the biggest ones on campus so that means A LOT of users are going to be affected and for a long time.

Finally, CLB opening hours. Again, I understand that the change was for better resource allocation. However, I think it makes absolute sense to extend CLB and other library operating hours in order to compensate for the inconvenience brought by the reduced study spaces.
Sorry for the long rant. What are your thoughts on this? Am I being too whiny or are you guys equally frustrated?

When something doesn't go their way, like not getting into Orbital (which is really only 4 MCs over the summer), these people start complaining like it's the end of the world, behave as if their CS major is forever ruined, and start demanding for things to start going their way.

These people need to realize that not everything is handed to you in university, and that they need to get used to not getting things that they want, and start finding solutions rather than waste time blaming things that can't/won't change, at least for the moment.

2467,"I've been together with him for almost 5 years. As much as I love him, I can't get rid of my insecurities that derived from his past wrongdoings. On good days, we are a loving couple. I choose to see only the good side of him, and he treats me well too. On bad days when I start to suspect he is going back to do things that would hurt me. I get paranoid, because it is not a one-off incident. Over the years, I've tried my best to trust him. But whenever I have flashback of what he did to me, I would question his actions, check on him and his phone - not because I want to pick on him, but I just didn't want what I fear most to happen. To me what he did has cheated on me emotionally and I just needed that assurance that it won’t happen again, ever. He doesn’t quite get it - he thinks I'm doing all these to picked on him. He said he has changed for the better. There were instances that I believe he did. But recently, I caught him doing something of that similar nature, which I can’t accept. The intentions, to me, were clear, and still the same. He claimed that there’s nothing bad or wrong. I disagree, because what he is doing it still fundamentally threatens the stability our r/s, and it breaks the trust I have for him or whatever that is left.

Instead of feeling remorseful for hurting me, he just decided that I should accept him for who he is, what he is doing, otherwise I should just leave. I felt that he just wouldn't give in anymore. And I can’t blame him fully for that. Because whenever I found out that he did something, I get more paranoid, and question him, even more. Our quarrels become more frequent, intolerable. I can’t sleep because I would have anxiety when the thoughts of him doing all those things behind my back comes flooding my mind. I tried hard to accommodate. But because the pain and hurt is still so fresh, and because I still have anxiety and panic attacks about the past incidents - I would become very very unloving and undesirable. He says he couldn’t smile at me or be happy to see me anymore. But he could, to others. No doubt he is still treating me relatively well when we are not quarrelling. But the way he sees me has changed. The way he thinks about me has changed. He sees me as someone that is unreasonable, pushy, overly demanding for him to change and every now and then I attempt to find fault with him and quarrel. But that’s not my intention. And I never want to quarrel with him. 

I try to find even more ways to prove to myself that he loves me, to make up to the part where I felt that he doesn’t. So whenever he’s with me, he’s nice to me – I’m okay. Cause I stop thinking. But when I realized he treat others somewhat better, or when he is not around with me, I will start to think otherwise. Cause I’m hurt from what he had done, I reacted because I needed time to heal. For hurting me, can’t he be more understanding? Why can’t he understand the pain he brought to me and the harm to the r/s for doing so. He said he is tired too. Tired of trying when he knows he can’t agree with me. And when these are the answers I get from him - I get more agitated, more upset. 

At this point, he would break it. He would get really pissed, at why am I always trying to find fault in him, and he would get really mad at me. He thinks I’m finding trouble with him, esp when he is tired from work. He would then block me off and get angry for days. Leaving me sleepless, paranoid and even more hurt. Even when I tried to talk it out nicely to him about my concerns – he would think that all these talks are useless.  It’s either I accept it, or I leave. 

Past few weeks was like hell. I felt the need to confront him about the matter that he was doing. I plead him to change because if he don’t, we can't move on. And I can’t sleep. I plead him not to do it, not to hurt me, but he can’t fulfil that promise. He doesn’t agree because he don’t see any wrong in it. I needed so much assurance. At the same time, because I decided to put faith in us and that he would eventually understand my pov, so I would raise this matter to him again and again, but every time – I get the same outcome- unhappiness, unsatisfied, unsettled. And he thinks I’m just looking to quarrel with him, not giving him any breaks week after week.

No longer does he want to be in this r/s, nor to change for us. But to me, even at the breaking point, even when I think that breaking up would be the better option since he couldn’t understand - I still decided that I don’t want to leave. Even when he doesn’t want this r/s anymore. Even when we can’t see where this is going. 

He says I’m selfish, selfish that I just keep wanting him to change. Is that really true? The change isn’t just a change in a bad temper – but an action that is fundamentally wrong to be done by someone who is in a r/s, who should stay committed and responsible. If this continues, I can’t stop being paranoid. I can’t trust him again and again if he chooses to stay like this. How to trust when whenever I trust him, but when I do check upon him – I get to see what I don’t want to see the most? It hurts, I feel that I’m torn apart. I can accept it as his past, but I can’t accept him not willing to change. Not because he sees it wrong or what, but it is affecting us. If he really wants the r/s, wouldn’t he put in effort too? He said he is tired of putting in effort when I can’t just give him some peace. But how to stop thinking when it’s not stopping.
Now, since he doesn’t want to change or hang onto this r/s, it’s just me – ultimately, whether I can accept his actions, and let it be there without ever turning to him and ask him to change. What should I do? I can't let go of a love that I hold so dear. I'm tired too. I'm not asking him to change completely, I just wish that he If he would compromise and try, I would try my best not to act up too. I really am trying but he can’t see it. And because it is true, we have been quarrelling nonstop in the past few weeks. What can I do if I want to keep this r/s? No trolls please.

After he left, however, he became a lot less attentive. He would reply whenever I texted him, but he never initiated any conversation with me - I always had to take the first step. Also, we have Facetimed only once in the months that he has been away.

I understand that he is very busy in his course and the time difference is a huge obstacle, so I'm not sure if I'm asking too much. 

Given that ours is a young relationship, I'm not sure if it's reasonable for me to be so insecure. I suppose the fact that he's older than me (he's in his mid-30s) means that he's a lot more secure in his needs and wants, and maybe he's just not the type who needs that much interaction with his significant other. 

 I don't want to come off as immature and clingy, but a small part of me is also starting to think that I deserve the best (we all do!) and maybe it's not him.

1) The next time you meet, say “omg did you lost weight? / omg you lost so much weight!”

2) “come let me treat you to some bubble tea!” Proceed to buy her bubble tea, but don’t force it on her if she really doesn’t want it

In the last 2 years, he became somewhat mentally unstable due to work stress and sometimes he'd vent his frustrations at me. Not abusive but he'll throw his tantrum whenever he is having a bad day(which is quite often probably once every 2 days). Being his girlfriend, I try to support him as much as I can but I don't think I can handle him anymore. Friends around me are getting engaged and married, but I don't think I'll say yes if he proposes mainly because I don't think I can tolerate his behavior for the rest of my life. I've talked to him about his temper and suggested that he should seek professional help but he refused and said he will try his best to change. I want to break up but I still love him. Advice?

2489,"I would like to share one awesome movie with you guys in Netflix. The movie called tall girl. After watching this show I found I have a similar experience with dunkers. Dunker is short guy who openly confessed to his love to his 7 years tall girl Friend. Finding ways to impress her and wanna be her bf. In my situation, although I am 181 tall guy and her height is about my shoulder length tall. But inside my heart, I felt so small and soft like dunkers in the movie. Cos she is always in the upper hand. She always told me we only can be friend and nothing else. I am happy to be her Friend rather than nobody. I spend lot of times and effort trying to win your heart. But all I get was a rejection. I know it is dumb and silly to do anything for her. But all I wanted is to make her happy. She is in a terrible situation and need to make big decisions in her life. The only thing I can offer is giving her more trouble and adding in more problem in the situation. I remember She once push me away, when I finally decided to set her free, she ask me back to her life. I was Glad and happy then but now I am confused. I always thought after she having a Long and hard day at school she will need someone like me to brighten her day a little. But I just not the right person and I think appear way too many times in her life. Start making her feel uncomfortable. But What I wanna her to know is I make time for her. Sometimes, I even make up stupid reason just to let her feel less awkward. In the movie, Dunkers know and  understand every little things about Jodi ( tall girl in the movie). E.g. her favourite Color, eye Color and etc. For me, to my knowledge maybe I know her at least 70-80%. There are a few Movie scenes really touches my heart. Showing unconditional love and care to her like the friends, family Jodi has. Note to her, No matter how dark and deep you are facing now I hope I can be the pulling you out. I might be the wrong guy at the wrong timing. But trust me, I won’t be the 1st to leave you till you are safe. Text me if you need me to be around.

At least for the first few times, being seen as generous and spontaneous is an important feel good factor for girls. It could easily go the other way and get you labelled with terms like ""calculative"" especially for cheaper items.

The important caveat here is not to allow yourself to be taken granted for in the long term. Generally have a sense of whether the girl have a sense of responsibility to share the cost sometimes. If they don't it's a major red flag for:

1. They are probably still receiving a lot of attention from other guys and actively exploring and comparing between you and others. At the start this is fine, but not healthy at all for the long term. This generally happens for girls that are still below 26 years of age.
2. The girl is a full-blown princess. Some people can accept this, but I believe most probably can't and shouldn't.

In those situations, just continue to be gentlemanly and generous for the remaining days but cut off the relationship cleanly.

I'm currently dating this girl and she told me that she will never allow me to send her home, not even to the MRT. Even when we study, we would only do it in school. I suspected that she had another boyfriend until I ask her after almost 2 months why she won't let me send her home or know her address. She told me she has trust issues because a guy she was with almost 2 years back stalked her home and cabbed down regularly to her house even though he stays in the North. She lives in the East. He would call her almost 20 times just to make her leave the house regardless what time it is to meet him whenever he wants to meet. She got so paranoid that even the mention of his name can get her into a panic attack. He would also inappropriately touch her and asked for sex even though she refused. (Yes she has seek the help from police but they didn't do much for her.) 

I really really like this girl and I would do anything for her. I definitely won't treat her the way that guy did and I really want her to trust me but it seems like even after  6 months together she still wouldn't tell me where she lives or invite me over to her place. Should I ask her if I can go over once and meet her parents or give her more time? Please help me

2520,"To the girl who posted thread 69845:


I was in a similar situation as you, except that my ex and I broke a few months back. It still hurts and is upsetting sometimes because I still have feelings for him but I knew it was a decision I had to make, either then or down the road. 


Perhaps our relationship dynamism was different from yours, so do take any advice/ comments with a pinch of salt and decide for yourself what is best for you.


My ex had more official relationships before me and dated quite a fair bit too, including with one of my friends (which I only knew much later since my ex and I only met after I left that school).


Whereas I had minimum dating experience and he was really the first one whom I really wanted to make things work.


I accepted that everyone has a past and that what matters now was my present and future with him. However, it was easier said than done. Especially when I knew that he still kept in touch with his exes (which he did tell me, to be fair to him).


I did not once expected him to cut off contact entirely with his exes completely because I know I can't change the past and some of them did accompany him during difficult times in his life.


What I couldn't make past was my insecurity and jealousy whenever his exes (and family even) liked his social media posts. I also had nagging thoughts if he said/ did similar date activities with his exes. 


We did talk about this and even then I still felt bad for letting my thoughts run wild. Despite me believing that he wasn't lying, he truly cared about me, perhaps what he did just wasn't sufficient to convince me afterall, I don't really know.


There were probably other differences we had to work out in our relationship but I would say this whole incident about exes and my insecurity about it was the catalyst for us to call things off.


I would still suggest you discuss this with him because it's the two of you in this current relationship. Find a way to work things out together. There's a reason why exes are exes and why you both are here together, at this moment. 


Try to work things out together and find a middle ground. If he demonstrates to you through action that you are really the one who matters now, and/ or attempts to alleviate your insecurity/ anxiety, that's great! But if nothing happens, at least you know you've tried.


It takes two hands to clap, take this chance to reflect on what causes this insecurity within you and work on it too (with him, alone, whichever is best). 


Remember that it is not fair to you if his past worries you and he does nothing about it, but neither is it fair to him if he truly loves you and you withdraw from him because of all this retrospective jealousy or whatever you call it. 


Consider too, if this experience is actually weakening the trust that you two have in each other. A relationship without a strong trust foundation can get really challenging. Don't self-sabotage if you both can help it.


Lastly, determine for yourself, how comfortable are you with building a future with a guy like this? What exactly is most important for you in a relationship, what so you want out of it? Can this guy give you what you want and vice versa? What can both of you do together to make this relationship work?


It can be a gruelling process (I had sleepless nights and lost weight over my ex then). Esp when it also happened during the infancy stage of our relationship. 


In the end, we decided to go down the route to call things off. You may call it selfish, but I really felt the need to work on myself first, my insecurity, to become a better partner for another in the future (which could be others, or him, or I may end up single my whole life for that matter).


All the best and hope you find peace and happiness, regardless the results :)

If there is any groupwork component, avoid the part-time students like a plague. Honestly, I am so sick and tired of having to do group work with a bunch of irresponsible and unmotivated pieces of s***. It seems this is fairly common. They'll always use work commitments as an excuse for not doing stuff, late or even no show. If you can, take classes offered in the day time or with minimal groupwork, to avoid these idiots.

Back as undergrad, sure, groupwork wasn't always smooth sailing. But many part time students, seriously their mind is not committed to studies and class at all. I think this must be a good reason why NUS (and the local unis in general) have virtually all their undergraduate programmes strictly on a full time basis. I used to think there was no reason why undergrad courses cannot be part time, but i really think its the huge difference it makes in the student mindset. Many part time students dont seem to take things seriously which makes you wonder wtf they are doing in uni in the first place.

So it was the first lecture of a particular module today and the lecturer was very engaging. She made us form into groups of 5/6s today to introduce ourselves to one another and since another guy and I were sitting at the far end of the table, we only form a group of 2, me and him. It was a little awkward as usual, as all of us were strangers. So he started the convo by introducing himself and I carried on.

After a short introduction, the lecturer started teaching and gave us some time to discuss certain questions after that. But girls beside me already form their own group since the ice breaker, so it's once again the guy and I. I was sort of awkward so I didn't look at his direction, avoiding all eye contact and any chance to discuss the question. So both of us just waited for the lecturer to continue. The second time this happened, he went out to get some food so once again, we didn't discuss.

After I reach home, I felt like I probably like him (ish). Maybe a crush? Or an eyecandy? So I started regretting how I avoided all the discussion opportunities.

So this woman here, is determined to reach the LT early next friday and strike a casual convo with him since i found out we had similar courses, which i forgot to ask which other mods he was taking. How dumb of me. Anyways, I just want to know if that guy would be freaked out by me. I'm just afraid he thinks I'm a weirdo who sorta ignored him the previous week but strike up a convo the following week.

P.s I'm only gonna do this if he is early for lectures because he was damn freaking early today. Im guessing he had a lesson way before the lecture we had. And if it goes well, I'll probably ask if he wants a study buddy for that module and the same module we failed last year. 

P.s.s yes, I'm an evergreen of 21 years and I'm sick of it. I want to change my fate this time round. How does my plan sounds guys?? Can give me some additional advice or encouragement. I scared i will chicken out eh how?? :'(

I was just telling my other friends in the clique that I was my friend’s third wheel at a movie date. A guy went like “why don’t you invite <my crush> along, then it will be a double date”

2532,"I used to have an ex boyfriend whom I loved a lot. We were together for a very long time and called it off last year due to his family’s intervention. It was his decision to do so without discussing with me on the breakup. We were still happily looking through wedding packages one week before that and he told me he love me few days before that breakup. I was very upset and disappointed he backed out and MIAed on me after a breakup text despite all that we have gone through together all these years (more than half a decade). 

Till today, I’ll still be reminded of the pain sometimes. And I’ll feel angry when I think of someone like him who doesn’t have any conscience, is probably leading a very happy life now, perhaps with a new babe already. Of course time heals and I feel that I’m almost there.. I can forgive but this will never be forgotten. 

There’s no closure to this whole relationship which I’ve spent my youth and efforts on. I wonder if there is a day where I can have a proper closure.. at least that’s what I think I deserve.

Then it turned into an argument and we haven't been talking for the whole day today. Funny thing is we ended up not meeting because of the argument. I feel like everytime we argue, I get more and more tired to the point that I just don't want to care anymore. Also, I feel super unappreciated. Just because he have been having common tests for the past week, I have been going over to his dorm to accompany him or trying to at least eat dinner with him and his friends (his roomie is fine with that). I don't even expect him to eat with me alone because he needs to eat with his friends. Yesterday, I made his favourite cake as a suprise for him to share with his friends. Then we had that quarell.

2543,"I met my bf in a dating app. BTW, we're both ajs. And since I am not a resident in Singapore, I told him of my plans pursuing a resident visa somewhere else. Although, initially he has reservations about LDR since it was the same scenario with his ex bf. But still he was and is supportive of my plans. 

He also decided to apply resident visa so we both can live happier life together.

After a few months later, I received the resident grant. Since all my siblings are already waiting for me there. They asked if I can immediately immigrate but I delayed since I still want to spend time with my bf for more than a year. At this time, I have not come out of the closet. Since I was scared of how they will react. Same goes to my bf.

At the start of our relationship, we are open to watch porn and relieve our carnal desires if either one of us is unavailable. But we never set boundaries. Such as sexting other people and sending nsfw pictures. Since, I thought this should not have been discussed and a general rule when you're exclusively dating.

Before our first anniversary I came out to my parents and siblings. Which was welcomed with different reactions. As usual my mum is against it but was glad my dad and siblings are supportive. He followed suit and told his mum and sister. Same scenario with both of our mothers but his sibling is so understanding.

So the day came when I have to fly and leave Singapore, which was hard since this was my second home and especially of bf. At the first six months away from each other. Our conversation would start with good morning and end with good night. But most of the time would have video sex.

But there are times when I called him crying due to lovesickness. And if what's the status of his application for resident visa as well. However due to stricter immigration rules and constantly changing visa quota he is still uninvited to apply. But we are still hopeful he will get invited  one day.

This year, to streamline our plans, he decided to look for a firm which has a headquarters in the country I immigrated. And he was able to get an offer and will be trained for two weeks. Which was the best and worst in our relationship.

We never argued about anything in our 2 years relationship, only then when I found out something.

One day when he was at work I opened his tablet, with his permission to use. And accidentally saw his twitter account. There I found his pictures flaunting his body and suggesting some indecent posts. To my surprise he has a number of followers too.

Which then lead me to dig for other messages, emails and other multi media. To my surprise he re opened some dating apps and was exchanging pictures and naughty messages.

At that night I confronted him and he told me he will no longer open those apps.

To his defense, he told me he only open those apps when I am out of reach due to time difference. And after messaging those guys he would no longer message them.

Even though he said he will not open those apps, I still have this feeling of infidelity. And would sometimes be the fuel of our argument lately.

This has affected my mental state and physical well being due to seeking closure in this chapter of our relationship.

He always remind me that he loves me and promises not to do it again. 

Although there's a good thing that came out of this. Ever since this happened. We constantly call each other and ignited our relationship.

But there are times when I feel depressed and be cold and distant to him. Which he'll notice immediately and will try to appease ans resolve my doubts and anxiety.

Then lately I found out he opened a dating app a month before my departure. Although he gave me the passwords and username of all his dating apps. Reading previous messages to other guys just haunt me. Which is also my fault for digging in.

It is hard for me to let go of the past since I felt betrayed but I know this will only strengthen our relationship. With his assurance, I believe in him. But told him if he ever do it again. No more second chance.

I know this will not be the biggest hurdles we have to face. One of which, once he will get a visa he will have to inform his mum about his plans to follow me. This would devastate both our mothers but we just want to live life and follow what makes us who we are and live a a happier life in a country who supports us. Plus the thought that their only sons would not marry a girl and have a normal life.

Its not that I dont know my stuff because I can contribute when we split the work, but somehow I just cant during a group discussion.

Have you guys ever experienced this, seeing someone you love having trouble in their relationship and you couldn’t do anything about it. The only thing you can do is to sit down at the mall for hours and think of ways to make her happy and smile. The pain inside my heart is hard to explain. You guys must be thinking, this is not my job to do all this. But trust me, when you really care about someone you will start doing silly things like this. We hangout a lot, and we talked about how his bf treated her. Her bf is an asshole. Every time when she need her bf to be there for her, he is not there. Her bf think he a smart ass, and he has this stupid pride or ego issue. He always think he is right. (Very 大男人). He make me feel like he think that he better than a lot of people. To let’s everyone reading this post to relate how  stupid he is. He is that kind of people you wouldn’t wanna be Friend with and also like giving him one big slap on his face. (Just start thinking someone you hated)

Seem like he already lost interest with my girl Friend and didn’t care about her at all. He didn’t even bother to do basic bf stuffs like sending and fetching gf.  He didn’t make time for her. The only thing he do is to sweet talk via text and my girl Friend will be fine with it. I told her this relationship won’t workout, unless her bf putting more effort. She doesn’t wanna breakup with his bf because It is also hard for her to let go. Sometime letting go is better than hurting yourself. 

Anyway if you follow NUS posts, I will like to explain what is the meaning of IRCAU. Which mean, I REALLY CARE ABOUT “U”

2547,"Dear friends,

I am gay. Yesterday I came out to my parents. I had just had an argument with my boyfriend and we broke up. I wasn’t in the right frame of mind and so I just decided to go ahead and come out to my parents. 

I expected them to be tolerant. Instead of that what I got was being chased out of the house. 

I slept at the HDB staircase last night. All I have with me are my phone, wallet and charger, a bag with some clothes and a water bottle. I’m fine right now, i use the charging ports and free WiFi at the mall nearby and I’m able to refill my water bottle/wash my face at the toilet. 

What do I do now? I’m really confused, hurt, and I hate myself - I feel suicidal. I’m a student, I don’t have much money and I don’t know how much longer I will be able to sustain myself. I feel like calling the police and asking them to bring my to IMH (at least I will have a place to stay). 

The other option is to go to a shelter but I don’t know how to go about doing that and I just feel helpless and lost. I feel alone. 

If you have read this, thank you for taking the time to read through it. 

TLDR: I’m homeless, broke, gay, suicidal and I have no idea what to do now.

My bf will always take the initiative to go make payment/settle the bill, be it for meals, movies tickets, activities on their travels etc. And if you’re wondering whether it’s because my bf is richer or earn more, nope they make about the same.  I earn way less than my bf and his relatives yet I offer to pay half the time and he lets me but doesn’t let them. His relatives are just really thick skinned. I have tried talking to my bf about it but he gets very defensive because his relatives are his priority and he’s totally willing. Perhaps it’s not my place to say who he should or shouldn’t pay for cos afterall I’m an “outsider”. But I fear that such habits will go on after we get married. To make things worse, they hang out very often, about a few times a week so he squanders a lot of money on them each week. I find it hard to accept a husband who squanders away hard earned money on his able bodied relatives with equal earning capability in the long term. Should I break up with him and is this be a dealbreaker for anyone else? Would really appreciate some advice.

2553,"This is a long post. My bf and I (both 21) have been together for 2 years. He’s midway serving NS while I’m working full time. 

I feel that my bf is being complacent in our rs. E.g. I’m always the one putting effort to make him happy and he doesn’t. He didn’t use to be like this.

I would understand if he’s busy with NS commitments and I thought that NS is a full-on tough 2 years. However, it isn’t much for him. He’s been very free in recent months and tells me he spends most of his day playing games and being on his phone. Isn’t it ironic: when he was busier during BMT and etc. he put in so much more care and effort towards me like texting me as much as he can and going out on dates. Now that he’s free, he doesn’t even drop me a text until to say goodnight. He’s not just free in terms of time, mind you, he can even leave his camp in civil clothes for lunch/dinner everyday which means he can go anywhere to waste some hours away in the day. I’m always wondering what he’s really doing with all his free time instead of giving me just a little bit of it. Is there someone else or he simply doesn’t care about me anymore? 

Not counting the times we go out to have meals because human beings need to eat, it’s been months since we went out. Every weekend is the same routine: I go to his home and Netflix, have sex and actual chill. Sometimes no Netflix even, just sex and chill. Am I just a bootycall or what? 

The only love I feel from him is all the sweet words he says like ily, I can’t live without you, I wanna marry you.... you get the drift. I give him everything he wants and my duty as a gf, time, intimacy, reassurance and occasional gifts and help whenever he needs anything. I’ve even jeopardised some important things to me just to make him happy but I won’t dwell into that.

I’m so envious of my friends and co-workers who are in rs and the gfs are being treated so well. I told a few close friends of mine and they react to my story with a look of pity. I’m not demanding to be treated like a princess, I just want to be treated decently like a gf. There are guys in my workplace expressing their interest in me and treating me better than my bf, but I love my bf and and I don’t want to give up on our rs. 

I wish he can reflect on our rs and change. This is a basic bf duty and I don’t think I should tell him step by step how to be a decent bf. Haiz... NSF guys, please don’t be like this to your GFs... We are the ones on the losing end if you waste our 2 years waiting for you just to be treated like this...

If you read this far, any opinion/advice would be greatly appreciated.

Btw if you follow NUSWhispers posts, I’m Carol mentioned in a post before.

I come for a low income family where both of my parents are cleaners so they don’t earn much by virtue. recently, my mother fell down while working so she’s resting at home and our finances are even tighter than before. she has used up all the paid leave and so she has no income now. in addition, my father’s salary alone is also not enough - after paying for the house and other bills, we barely have any money left. 

I want to share the financial burden with my parents but my course is very demanding and I have classes everyday (which is why teaching tuition is not an option for me). On weekends, I have to take my grandparents for dialysis so I’m not available either. I’m already under financial assistance for NUS so I’ve already gotten all the help I can possibly get. I don’t have much savings because every time my parents fall sick, I use my money to pay for their medical bills since they don’t earn enough. My finances are so tight now that I can’t even afford to eat in school when my hours aren’t long and I’ve been having instant noodles at home daily for the past few weeks. Please help... Even an extra $200 per month is good for me...

Girls are always craving food, thinking of food, and finding new cafes to try. Girls always say they love to eat! But when they do eat, they say their appetite is small, and ask males to help finish because males supposedly have bigger appetites? 

But males, whose stomachs can finish so much food, don’t “love” food! They don’t care about what they eat, they are not enthusiastic about trying new food, and they don’t even go dessert shops to share cake! 

If men can eat so much, why don’t they say they love food? shouldn’t they be the ones always eating candy, chocolate, cake, and ice cream all the time?

Girls always say they love food and have cravings, yet they are the ones who say “but girl cannot eat much what”.

So I went to do some digging and found that he is following ALOT of guys as well as male models/idols. Most of these guys are half-naked in their dp.

Yes, as much as we complain about how the NUS Shuttle Bus isn't frequent enough to meet our needs and are often like a roller coaster, there are actually things that WE, the users of the shuttle bus, can make things better too!
1) To the people who are dying to get on the bus, please make way for people to get off. If you block the entire exit of the bus, are the people getting off supposed to step on you? Also, don't squeeze onto the bus as people are getting off, waiting for another minute won't kill you and will make the entire boarding process easier.
2) To the people who love to stand by the door when people are getting off, I hate to break it to you but you aren't as skinny as you think. No one fancy shoving through you to get off the bus. If you can step off the bus and reboard later, everyone will be able to have a pleasant experience. 
3) To the people who have already gotten onto the bus, if you see people trying to squeeze on the bus, please just take a step closer to your fellow commuters and more people can fit into the bus!
4) To the people who carry huge ass backpacks, putting your bag down on the bus will free up space for more to get on and also, you won’t be shoving your bags into your fellow commuters’ faces.

My bf and I are in our late 20s and just got together a few months ago. Since then, to be very honest, I’ve been having difficulties getting over his past relationships and sexual history. He’s more experienced in this aspect than me, having had 4 ex gfs and a number of one night stands previously, as compared to me having only 2 serious relationships before I met him (and never been on casual relationships / one night stands before). Sometimes the thought of him doing romantic and intimate stuff with his exes randomly cross my mind and make me feel uneasy. Even when we’re going about our daily lives, I’m sometimes bothered by such thoughts e.g.while having nice dinner out, I’ll wonder if he has taken his exes to the same place that we are eating. Same goes when we are trying new activities together or travelling. I even went to the extent of stalking his exes on social media and felt even worse after seeing that some of them are relatively good looking, and some still keep their couple photos with my bf.
I haven’t voiced out this issue to my bf as I’m scared it might cause unnecessary arguments that jeopardise our new relationship. Moreover, I also feel bad for opening up to him, as he has been really nice and loving to me so far, always around when I need him, always reassuring me that he loves me a lot and that he is very thankful to have found me. 
I know this is unhealthy and I really hate myself for feeling this way but I’m clueless as to what I can do to get over this jealousy / insecurity. Please help me, I’ll really appreciate it.

I have been following this page for a while now and realised there are quite a few posts about people saying they are unable to find love. They sound like not finding love makes them the beta human. I would like to say that I was and still am a beta person according to their criteria. But let me give you ""beta"" people an advice. You must have a goal and a burning passion for something in life. Let me tell you that once you have found this goal, you won't have time to worry about not getting a gf/bf cause you will have a bigger goal now. I excel in my passion and im one of the best in my country. People ask for my autograph when they see me in conventions. (It's a gaming hobby that i picked up 7 years ago). People might say ""oh you are the best cause you are smart"". I'm not even smart, my CGPA is only 2.4 and I am slow in learning. but what made me achieve my goals is my passion and the attitude to never give up rather than me being born smart. You have to put your goal above everything else except family. I hope the ""beta"" people here takes my advice and try to work on finding a goal and purpose. It really will change your life and the way you look at things. 

Yeah sex is cool and all but have you ever tried achieving your goals and have people you don't know want your autograph?

We met because of my CCA and I took it upon myself to show her the ropes in hopes she would do well and I slowly found myself falling for her. We would even conduct extra practice sessions over the weekends and I gladly did it as it was an excuse to see her I guess. But she decided to quit as she couldn't juggle studies and this CCA as it takes up a ton of commitment. But even after she left, we continued talking and met up occasionally. But everything went downhill when I confessed to her one day, she said she did not want a relationship and we actually stopped texting soon after.

I went about my life for the next two years but never sought out a relationship with another person, but we got in contact again due to an insta story reply and we actually started hanging out frequently again. I found out later she found a boyfriend about a year ago from her friend but she never did mention him to me, and that made me realise whenever we hung out she never leaves any social media footprint, even when we did go to her favourite places and i've seen her take tons of pictures and post them when she goes there with her other friends.

I am in a really confusing place right now, on one hand I know I love her and I make it clear to her my feelings towards her have never changed for the last 3 years, yet on the other she is in a relationship now and she still gladly hangs out with me which I feel is wrong.

I'm from the CoffeeMeetBagel guy and hope I can enlighten you. The fact is, when people say you look ok, it won't get you girls. When people say you're good-looking, you barely made it looking 'ok' for the girls. Never doubt yourself if you're good enough for her or not, be confident, if you think she's in your league, go for it. But manage expectations, don't aim for a 8/10 if you're a 4/10, practically speaking. Yes, it can happen, if you have charisma. Good-looking people also have our own problems, it's like an express pass to girls, but in the long-run, we still face similar problems other couples experience. I wouldn't advise going on dating apps if you're looking for a potential someone. Go to events, meet people in real life, speak to them, it's better. Dating apps are cruel, and tbh I wont reply to most that I matched. All the best mate, hope love finds you.

2610,"I am not sure if you would ever chance upon this. While I do hope that you do (I did really hope someone in your hall or in FASS would bring this to your intention!!), I am slightly hesitant thinking whether there is a need for this. But I want to confess and express it all out. Maybe I am just selfish, trying and hoping that through it all you would understand why I did what I did and find it in your heart to forgive me for all I have done and the hurt it has had on you. Definitely, you have a part to play la. I am just apologising from my side.  But, I just want you to know, I am not trying to justify for the thoughtlessness and carelessness that I was, in handling what happened between us. 

Before I go about apologising, I just want you to know first that I was just someone who was never good at handling my emotions and expressing myself, not even to my parents. I didn’t realise only until recently that I was keeping everything within me, compartmentalising all my thoughts, feelings and insecurities, without ever acknowledging and facing up to it.  I did not even know what it was like to be feeling stress, until I have had a mental breakdown. Even when I had a panic attack, I was not even aware why I had one. I never thought it would be a big problem, until I was at the brink of it in April/May this year. That was when I created a fake persona on Tinder, introducing myself as a 25 year old NUS sociology student, a senior of yours in FASS. Just to make it clear, the face is mine. I don't think that was catfishing... right? 

The reason for creating a fake persona was because I was a teacher, and I felt slightly ashamed about wanting to seek thrills on Tinder. I guess it got to do with my standards on how a teacher should conduct herself. Back then, it was a build-up of a lot of events that happened in my job that I felt somewhat trapped and at lost with what I should do. I felt empty, lost and just isolated, and I desperately wanted to feel excitement in my life even though it would be short-lived. At least, I could feel alive. As a teacher, I really omg love my students, and that was the struggle I had. Amidst the love for them, I met with setbacks such as my student hitting me frequently through that Term, and often have to stop my classes to chase another student who ran out of the classroom. I really love my students, I really love how despite their special needs, there are just so pure and special. I really hope to help them grow, but I was often challenged by these actions of theirs. I was miserable with myself for being unable to get over the anger of being hit by my student even though I love them. I guess my poor coping mechanism and my inability to express myself made me feel really isolated and negatively about myself. As such, that was how that profile on Tinder came about, a way to escape from this all and seek some thrills. And that was how we got to know one another. Apparently, I looked like a good Christian girl. Yay, me.

I did not know why I had to lie about the true reason behind the fake persona. I also panicked when you confronted me about it, and I in the bid to make you stay, shared that I was ashamed about my past of making wrong decisions in life and things that happened to me such as the one where a close guy friend of mine overstepped his boundaries in the park and started to do things. I was so traumatised and scared by it. Yes, these were things that happened in the past, real events that I experienced, and I never shared with anyone. Did it impact me? Yes, it did. Was I disgusted and ashamed about what happened? Yes. But it was not the reason behind the cover. I am sorry, I lied. I guess I did not process much about what happened earlier that Term in my job and just was not aware that I was stressed out, and it was the real reason behind everything that I was feeling – emptiness and being lost. 


The circumstances in which we met were somewhat messy. You were bored and wanted FWB, while I was lost and just wanted some thrills. It made perfect sense for something casual. But, within me, I was slightly unsure the extent of my thrills. There was another lie I said, I guess to make you be more confident and WOW-ed by me and my experience, LOL. The only extent to which I went was just sexting ah LOL. But I think I told you, I physically met up with guys. But I did not lie, that while it was thrilling, I was disgusted by my actions and also how fleeting the moments were. After a while, it was just back to empty again. When I opened about this, I guess we started the real talks. It felt really good talking to you, and I enjoyed it. I just felt like we clicked. I never felt so easy to just talk with someone. The conversation just flowed, and I had a lot of fun just chatting with you. I guess we already had a bit of HTHT. Back then, when we started the chatting, I was In Japan on holiday. I think you didn’t know, but I stayed up really late, just so I could chat with you. We hit it off well and could exchange opinions easily. I felt comfortable sharing. I am not sure about you, but I don’t easily connect with people. Maybe that’s why I was really amazed and impressed by you. I just want you to know that whatever views I shared and my thoughts on the world and things, were not fake, they were truly my own independent one. I guess, I was just more confident sharing and voicing my views and opinions on things under this fake persona. Hindsight, I realised perhaps everything that had happened had really taken a toll on my own confidence and esteem. It reached rock bottom. 

The first time I met you, you weren’t what I expected HAHA. That was why I was nervous and awkward, I was just caught by surprise. But eventually over the course of the dinner, I became calmer and more comfortable with you. Do you remember, we ended up walking around Gardens by the Bay, where we saw the light show, and later walked to another part of the garden where we made out. When you first asked me if I wanted to date you. I was unsure. Back then, I was still talking to several guys on the app, but I didn’t feel like I clicked as well with them as with you. But I was unsure, because I was very lost with where I was in life, and asking me to be a potential partner, when I was just looking for thrills to escape things just made it more confusing. I don’t think at that state of mind and position in life, I was ready for a relationship. I had other problems that I had to deal with too besides my job, things that I have also compartmentalised but not acknowledge – a lot of untrue negative beliefs about myself. I guess this was the start of me mishandling everything thoughtlessly and carelessly. Basically, I screwed up.

I wouldn’t say everything that happened was totally my fault. I felt pressured by you into giving an answer on whether we should date. It felt like there was a time frame for deciding and I would miss out an opportunity to try out with someone that I felt potentially something for. I know it would be not right to ask you to wait, and you wouldn’t either. But maybe I should have told you everything and let you understand from my side. Ya so, I felt really cornered and eventually agreed even though I was not ready. I did not want to potentially lose you. Oh, silly me, I shouldn’t have. 

I really wished I could have been honest with you. Maybe things would have played out differently. But the truth is, we never know. Life is just unexpected in so many ways. But if things did not play out this way, I wouldn’t have realised all my problems and be on ‘recovery’ mode now. With the help of a counsellor, I have started expressing myself to my parents and even to myself, making sense of things and emotions. I have started to be honest to myself about everything and understanding my limiting false beliefs and trying now to change them. I wouldn’t be trying to make sense of my misery and what I want for myself in life, as well as show myself self-love. I wouldn’t realise that I have some insecurity in abandonment and feared being on my own. I wouldn’t have realised all the silly and harsh things that I have put myself through just because I want to ‘punish’ myself for things that happened in the past. I wouldn’t have realised a lot of silly things that I am doing to myself. Where is that self-love!!

I am really sorry that my position at the point in time, and my insecurity in myself, jeopardised things. Also, because I was lost in myself and held compounded harsh negative beliefs in myself, I found it really hard to belief that you would like me. I feared that it was not true, and you might leave. So, I tried hard not to let myself show that I liked you as much. I did, a lot. Yet, I tried not to let it be seen through my actions. I acted nonchalant and prevented myself from doing certain caring actions to you, when I really wanted to!!! But liking you was the problem too. Because of misery, I met you. Somehow, it just became that you and my friends were the only source of happiness then. Only when I was talking to you, or out with you or them, did I feel happy, having escape from things that were miserable. We both know, such a scenario is unhealthy. I knew I didn’t want things like this, but I could not help preventing things from turning that way. I knew at that point in my life, I was not okay being alone. I tried having alone time, but it was bad, I did not have the right state of mind to not ruminate on negative things. I really should have talked to someone about it to help me see things from other perspectives. So, when things ultimately went south one night, I decided to break it off with you first, to let me feel that I was in control of something. I was just an emotional wreck, with school just reopening and having the stress coming up to me again because of the national exams. I was just so scared of you saying you don’t want to continue after the ‘fight’, that I decided to say it first. Anyways things wouldn’t have lasted seeing how I started to try getting validation from you for myself. It is something that we talked about and both of us agreed that we dislike it. Ya, I think what I liked was also, how our views on relationship were somewhat similar. But I am sorry that for some reasons, I did not act in the way I said I wanted things to be like. 

I am really sorry that even after I decided to break it off, I tried asking to be friends, and being upset when you initially did not want to, and even subsequently having the cheek to ask you for another chance (???, goodness me). I am glad you did not waiver and instead decided to block me out of your life. It is best that you do not get tangled up with my shit now. I guess after breaking off, I just became really selfish. I was sad and felt like life returned to square one. I wanted to quickly jump out of it, and so I wanted to get a hold on you. But the thing is, I must solve this problem, if not I can never move on and grow. I am really sorry for being so selfish and that point in time that I couldn’t let you go. Still did small actions, trying to test you and get you back OMG. To think I even wrote that hidden intention filled letter.... *face-palm*. I’m sorry, I did that. The book was real though, I really thought it would help you. But I hope you didn’t throw it away. 

I am really sorry for the way I treated you and handled things carelessly and thoughtlessly from the start to the end. Clearly, I did not really think much from your perspective. When I decided to initiate the breakup, then friends, then back together, it must really have made you feel like a disposable being, where I just as and when claim you back whenever I have that FEELS. Sorry, I did not consider your perspective and feelings. 

It was really fun talking about the future, the things we wanted to do together and about wedding plans (vvv early I realised). I really wished we could have seen it through (a bit too early to say). And also delusional for me to think that everything was going to fall in place nicely just as in fairy tales. I knew somewhere along the line after we started dating, things went wrong and you became someone filling up something that I and my life was lacking in, and you became that someone at that point in time who liked me just because I could not like myself as much. I know the circumstances in which I was in, shouldn’t have defined me nor made me feel less for myself, but due to poor coping, I let it affect me. And you became in it, ughh. 

I am really sorry for what happened between us. May you find it in your heart to forgive the things that I have done. I know that you feared that lying is my way of coping with things because of the fake persona thing. But besides that, I think sometimes I do lie about things that I feel ashamed about because of certain standards I set for it. But anyways, I have started to learn to express things clearly, and really trying to not lie about myself anymore. I guess I am thankful to you also, for what happened, otherwise, I would still be living with the wrong strategies, and going to live my life that way. 

I really wish you would read this, BUT wells I leave it up to the Gods.

One day there was this online gathering, and I decided to attend since I have many online friends there and thought it would help me get through life a bit. From there, I met this girl. It wasn’t love at first sight, heck I was even trying to stop myself from falling in love with her since you know, suicide and also I was never in a relationship. But we bonded so well, she knew all of my secrets, even those i never told my 2 closest friends. She helped me through my depression. Gave me support, hang out with me. Said thingd like “I love you” but as a friend. holding hands, kisses on the cheek. Those 3 weeks was the most happy I have been in my entire life. She gave me a reason to live. She made me want to live. 

However, in later time I realised, she suck at love. Cause a few weeks after that initial “Happiest time of my life”, she started saying she have feelings for another man. Which I can’t do anything about since we were never officially together. All I can do is wish her a happy life. But we promised to stay as best friends. However, slowly be depression started to deteriorate again, which officially ended relationship with 3 of my best friends. Those 2mentioned prior and the girl i was in love with. So I shut myself off from life for a period of a month or so. Come back to found out she found another boyfriend. Then i realised, she suck at love she cant stay commited to a single person. Because of that, many of her victims suffered. 

Im not going to lie, I still have feelings for her since she made me felt love i never had before. But is she really worth it? Cause i bet if im there for her when she breaks up she will just play with me once again.

Please make a police report if you have not; there's a 99% chance that the guy took upskirt photo or video of you. Trying to warn other girls on NUSWhispers probably won't help as much as you taking action.

Personally I've experienced the same before (hence the anonymous response to you). Barely anybody on the escalator yet this foreign nationale stood two steps behind me. I found it strange but I didn't do anything... until I felt something brushed against my thigh. Turned over, saw his phone camera facing upwards. Asked him what was he doing and he denied doing anything but while he was trying to hide his phone, I saw that the camera mode was on. Demanded he hand over his phone to prove that he didn't take photos of me, he resisted and tried to flee. But I held onto his mobile phone tight and tackled him. I called him out and yelled for help. Even though the public just stood around to watch the show, nobody helped, I managed to nab him and eventually he got deported. I still feel ashamed that I'm a target of such a crime but at least those photos never made it to anywhere and he can't harm other girls in this country ever.

Do yourself justice and report to the police, please.

2626,"Hi OP of #69729

I’m really sorry to hear about your situation. You sounds very exasperated and all of this is obviously wearing down on you. 

Having said that though, I highly recommend you seek a marriage counsellor like many have suggested. And that should be the only advice you take from NUSWhispers. Not saying there’s no good advice here, but when it comes to marriage, both parties should be involved as much as possible, and marriage counselling allows an impartial third party to hear from both sides and mediate discussions between both parties(so your wife can’t just walk out of it and end the discussion then). If you want to talk to discuss to friends and family about it by all means, but take their advice with a pinch of salt since they only heard your side of the story. All the best OP

It is not that I really took him as a tool for my happiness such that he didn’t bother to me, or like I just used him as an object. I did like him. But to me, liking someone takes time and effort to build and develop into something even stronger. Everything was just really messed up then, and I just ‘used’ him and relied heavily on him on being happy and satisfied in myself. Everything just started revolving around him. I was heavily dependent on him to make me happy and desperately sought that validation through him and not myself. Yes, this is not healthy, it never is. And all these and my insecurity just came in and jeopardised the development of slowly falling for him.

2628,"I am the op of #69729. Firstly thanks to the comments and advices.  I wish I could say more but thousand of words can't write my piece of story. 

I want to add on, at first I think it was post/pre natal depression too so I decided to endure and tolerate and I even blame myself for trying to argue with her.  I tried to give in but no avail.  When she wants to explode she will find 101 ways no matter what I do.  A very good example is 1.5month after labour she still has discomfort. She complained to me and I to comfort her by assuring her that I saw the wound it's nothing serious and I believe she is in pain . Prior to that I everyday check on her wound and ask her about it and tell her I will arrange for a day within the week to bring her to consult a doc in a nice tone. I even told her I'm worried about her wound not healing up proper.  

Next instance she began blaming me.  Saying that the pain Is still there and I can't do anything.  Even if sees the doc they will still make the wound pain and she can't take it. Throwing a tantrum at me thereafter, end up I got angry and ask her so what she wants me to do? I began doubting myself.  

Similar story was during one of the check up in hospital during her pregnancy. She was going for glucose test that needs to prick her finger.  I told her pricking of finger IMO is better than drawing blood from the arm.  The pain is lesser to me. She argued and say that I am wrong.  Pricking of finger is much more painful than drawing blood from the arm. 
She then stands up and walk away in the midst debating.  She said I don't understand her.  I am not the one feeling the pain. She make big fuse in the hospital by scolding the nurses and doctor over little things. Scolding me loudly and took off our wedding ring wanting to dispose it.The doc got angry and wanted to cancel our package with them, upon hearing she toned down. 

I have a few ex lovers before but all are already blocked and removed from my life. I didn't cheat on her before and work towards this rls wholeheartedly.  I've took responsible for the accidental pregnancy and took on the roles. Her parents are very good and understanding BTW, they know their daughter personality and thank me for giving in everytime.  

I have deprived of sleep for couple of mths with only 3-4 hrs for most days. And i can't concentrate on anything. I have work, the baby and her to take care of. I gave my best but she feels insufficient. 

I posted here because I am lost. In the end I don't know what decision I will make. It's too hard and many things are into consideration. I just wanna read advices. Thanks and sorry for the long post again.

2635,"My wife and i had been together for 1.5 years, we got married 6mths ago. She is a very possessive girl and i am fine with it because i am possessive too. However she forced me to delete my female friends on facebook and instagram because she saw me looking at their photo when scrolling thru the newsfeed or if i look at their stories, there were even once when i accidentally liked one of sec school friend post..  

In the beginning of our r/s i told her i had a rather good female childhood friend from my sec sch and wanting to intro her but ended up she forced me to delete her off everything....fb,insta, phone number and i must block her before deleting. We argued multiple times because i refused to do so and i explained she's married and even had a baby and we are just purely friend but she don't believe in good friends among opposite sex, eventually i gave in because i am tired of arguing.

Unfortunately we got married because my wife was pregnant. During the days when she was pregnant she would shout at me in the public which she didn't do so in the past, i tolerated her because i didn't want to make her angry and cause any discomfort to my baby inside. I confronted her when we were back home and she told me it was because of her hormones changing due to the pregnancy, so for 9 months i tolerated her hot temper. There were even times when she would threaten me to die with the baby. I almost felt into depression because i felt belittle as a man. 

There were 2 times when i can't tolerate it anymore i punched the wall so hard that my knuckle sored for a month. One of them is because i look at a caucasian girl and she slapped me in the public and refusing to leave the store after it was closing and the security guard almost wanted to call the police. I explained to her why i look is because that couple is interesting to me, the guy is a chinese guy and is rather short and the caucasian girl is taller than him significantly so i took a few glance.

  
There were also once during a trip when i went to the gym at the hotel and during the interval of sets i chatted in a group chat with my poly friends. When i returned she saw my phone while i was bathing and she discovered the chat. She then threw my phone and started attacking me and shouting vigorously and i have to calm her down. Security came up to our room because there was too much commotion. She blamed me for chatting with female poly friends more than the rest of the guys and why i didn't text her to chat? Btw she didnt have connection.

All in all i wanted to say is during her pregnancy i tolerated all kinds of mental abuse which i never had experienced before. She would come up with all kinds of ways to rebutt me by saying i don't understand her situation as she is pregnant. The fact is i feel i gave in 200% of myself. Some of those i can't even believe that i actually tolerated.

But finally after labor i thought my nightmares are over but it actually just started. She continue to kick a big fuss over everything. I gave my best to provide her whatever i can, full time nanny, maid and post natal masseuse and gave her all my available time. Despite all she still complains and feel i didn't give enough. I really don't know how to handle anymore. 
I know a lot of you will say we jumped into it too quickly but she wasn't like this before marriage, only a little too over in the possessive part. I am at my wit ends now thinking of ways to keep this family up.I don't look forward to life anymore, there is no rainbow or sun in it. I am a very positive person, i comfort myself after every setbacks but now i just want to breakfree. Thank you for reading.

Reason is because of cheating before and during my pregnancy which I eventually terminated as a result of him convincing everyone to force me to terminate and also he was being friendly with his married ex at that time. I suffermed from depression thereafter dropping out of school. I left him after realizing he did not change and that people around him started terming me a psycho.
Now he came back to me claiming that he is sincere and wants a chance. I rejected as I feel that he is a chronic liar and this rejection made his family send me hate messages about how I should be liable for him.
I suggested we be friends as it is impossible for us to be in a relationship as it has taken a toll on my health and people around me. He has been rather insistent in his attempts to forge a relationship with me, going as far as to waiting outside my home. I agreed to meet up with him and realized what he wanted was sex. I rejected him and told him that I will never agree because of what happened in the past and also because he has not changed.
A few days ago, he told me that he is returning home and proceeded to block me. I do admit to having a soft spot for him even though I am sure that I no longer wish to be with him as it is highly stressful being the one always giving in.

I've always been rejecting him even tho I'm actually attracted to him both physically and sexually. He's soft spoken and has a super sweet smile. He doesn't mind doing boyfriend stuffs for me such as carrying my bags, lending me his jacket, sending me off to the busstop and stuff like that since we hang out often. It's cute but I know the motive behind all these things so I don't really have strong emotions about this.

To be honest, his performance was meh even though I understand he was the one doing all the actions plus it was an unexpected situation so maybe he got too excited? Anyway, this is not the point. Even though his performance was average, he cuddled with me the whole night, sent me home the next day and acts normal as how we usually act as friends.

But there is something I really really truly need to know. Was there ever a time when you had something for me? The answer to your question was yes, every single you is you. You were the only one on my mind when I wrote it. I wanted to say yes. But there're other sides of me that you don't know about.

You are still the only person that I am truly comfortable being around. By the only person, I mean truly the one and only person. Not even my family gives me the level of ease I have around you. You're the only person to had seen that many sides of me. There's one and last side of me you've yet to fully see. The side which scares even myself. A monster eating away me from the inside. How could I bring you into all of this?

Have you ever discover something so precious to you that you'd do anything to preserve it? Keep it in the current state. Not looking for more. Fear of ending up with less. Knowing and unwilling to take the next step to pull you into my misery you know nothing of. The craziest irony is that you may the one and only to unlock whatever's drowning me. As I walk in the dark, I will not grab the hand coming from the light fearing that I'll drag you into my side instead. I'll sink in comfort knowing you've once extended your hand towards me.

How have you been? Did he hurt you? How I wish I can be the hands to pick you up when you are feeling down. I may not be the one holding your hands, bringing you to places you want to be. But I'm happy being in your shadow, ready to catch you if you ever find yourself slipping back. My hands are on your back supporting you, pushing you towards something better than me.

Will I someday reach your side to be the one to hold your hand into the future? A part of me is screaming 'yes', while another part of me drags me back convincing myself that I'm in too deep. Too deep to recover, I will only stain and affect everybody else's mind when I choose to enter them.

Back to you. Yes you, if I could choose it will be you. I shouldn't have lied that day. I shouldn't have let you walked away. If only I grabbed you, held you instead of letting you go, pushing you away. I love your 'crazy', it doesn't annoy me. I love your character, you have an opinion, you get it heard. I love your independence, you know what you want, you get it done. I love your love for your life, you get yourself out there, get to places you want to be it by yourself or with others. My days are getting darker by the day. The lesser I want to taint your life.

The more I think about you. The more I'm ready to go. Not everything comes twice in life. I believe I've found the perfect fit in you for me and I'm unable to grab onto you. I don't foresee it getting any better in the coming days. I don't foresee anybody else who can convince me out of this place ever. It was great while it lasted. Every memory of you will be buried deep in me and cherished forever.

He would initiate a conversation by pretending that he needed my help with study. Initially, I was happy to discuss study with him because he is smart. After a while, I started to feel that he was just finding excuses to talk to me, as he is much smarter than me that he doesn't really need my help. In fact, whenever he discussed study with me, he reminded me that I am not smart, which hurt my self confidence. He is not interested in me romantically, he is just too lonely and he needs to talk to someone, but I really hate discussing study with him. I tried talking to him about other things not related to study, but he has a tendency to report to me what he does daily which makes the conversation boring. Are there better things I can do besides ignoring him?

After ordering our food, another girl came out of the toilet and went to sit in front of the guy. It turns out to be my ex-gf!!! It was so awkward to be sitting infront of my current gf, and beside my exgf! When my ex found out it was me, she gave me the lppl face. I can see that she wanted to change seats but the restaurant was full so she had no choice.

Now a little background story with my ex. We broke up literally because of sex 1+ yr ago. And I quote from her text to me in the past, “I love you but our sex sucks.” She said I came too fast even before we really did anything. But thanks to her, I actually learnt to last longer with my current gf.

I understand the whole of SDE is undergoing renovations and the faculty basically does not exist. Okay, that's terrible planning for people who claim to study ""Design and Environment"" but I won't throw too much shade here because it might not have been their decision or fault entirely.

Before you ask, yes, this is about ThinkLab.

Before Archi took over or Com Ctr decided to allocate it to Archi, it was a free-to-use computer lab. There were people inside it at any given time of the day and some days it was hard to find a seat. And this isn't some small room we're talking about. There were at least a hundred over computers in there and they were regularly full up during exam period (okay where isn't) and even on a daily basis, the place was mostly occupied.

Now they've took over the lab because they closed theirs down for renovation. Alright. Fair enough, you need computers.

But you're going to plaster a sign that says ""ENTRY STRICTLY ONLY FOR DEPARTMENT OF ARCHITECTURE"", revoke everyone else's access to the lab, and have it empty full-time save for 3 lessons a week? Why?

Why not just have it open for the public for most of the day since nobody uses it anyway, and then put up a sign to get everyone out for the period of the lesson? It works for the engineering computer labs, I don't see why you have to be different and special.

And the fact remains that it's empty for most of the day. This is just being selfish.

As the bus took a sharp turn, my raising hand consistently brushed against his chest and I could feel his nipple getting hard. I was feeling so awkward but I couldn't put down my arm because there was no space for me, I would end up slapping someone's face.

2669,"In response to 69605:

This is not at all uncommon for guys during the first times. Many have said it could be nervousness and that’s definitely part of it. Another thing you might want to consider is your masturbation habits. Do you masturbate often? Do you watch porn? There’s nothing wrong in doing so, however this can lead you to have less sensitivity in real life. There’s also a term called the “grip of death” (google it) many guys, when masturbating, apply quite a lot of pressure. This leads to less sensitivity during the act itself. Consider taking a break from masturbation for a week or two. How doesn’t it feel?

What I would say is be playful and take your time. Be present and focus on the intimacy.  Forcing the issue might just make it even more of a problem. Become a master on other types of sex that focuses on her pleasure (seems you’re already doing great ;) ) and let it come naturally. Ask her to focus on other areas of your body too rather than just your groin and find what works. Good luck!

I'm currently in a LDR. I'm so stressed because my boyfriend is a foreigner and I am trying to find ways to live and work in his country. But due to Visa difficulties (extremely difficult to obtain a visa as a fresh grad), I will most likely work in Singapore after I grad. 

I really want to end the long distance and be in the same city but at the same time I have to face reality. I cant simply just fly over without plans and without a job. He has thought of coming over but it is equally as hard or even more difficult. He has a relatively above average pay from working and coming to Singapore with not so stellar CV will probably mean he may not be able to get the same level of pay. Plus given the high living cost here and the foreigner tax he has to pay, it is an option that is not preferred atm. 

Another way is to marry and get Visa to work legally there. But I am not ready for marriage... I guess I will just have to work in Singapore and hope that we survive the long distance for another 1 to 2 years?

Initially, I was told they would charge $35/h and they would collect 50% of commision for the first month. They claimed that the payment would be through the center to assure tutors remuneration. However, my tutee told me that the center charged her $40/h instead. This created some animosity between me and the tutee's parents. Furthermore at the end of the month, I was told by the center that I should collect the fees directly from the tutee instead. Upon confronting them, I was notified that apparently I was not under this ""QA Scheme"" that guaranteed tutors remuneration. Neither my tutee nor I was informed about this. Just like that, the responsibility of fee collection was passed from them to me. The worst of my nightmares had yet to end. Shortly after, my tutee decided to end the tuition, which left me with some uncollected fees. Throughout this whole ordeal, Learnseeker provided no support whatsoever deserving of that 50% commission. Till now, I have yet to collect my remaining fees. My point is, Learnseeker ought to provide greater transparency and give more concise instructions and not prey on undergraduate students by using vague and misleading terms in agreement.

2684,"What are people’s opinions of relationships with large age gaps (7-9 years)? I’ve fallen for this guy who’s that much younger than me and we’ve decided try to make this relationship work despite objections from parents on both sides. Although young, his maturity level is around the same as mine and I feel that our conversations are on the same frequency. He’s also smart, funny and is always so sweet to me. 

I understand the concerns of our parents but I’m not willing to let this relationship go just because of the many obstacles that we’ll be facing in the future. As he’s currently still in poly, whereas i’ve recently gotten a full time job, my parents are afraid that i’ll spend all my hard earned money on him and on our dates instead of saving the money. But tbh I don’t mind paying for him for meals and stuff since i’m earning more than 10 times his monthly allowance. He always insists in paying for at least some of our dates anyway so I know he’s not with me for the money. On the other hand, his parents are afraid that he’ll lose focus on his studies due to him spending more time with me. But little did they know that he’s studying even harder since meeting me as he wanted to do well to get into a local uni. Another huge obstacle that we’ll face in a few years would be NS. There has been so many stories of people breaking up when the guy goes to NS. Even if we did survive the NS period, he’ll enter uni and meet  a lot of new people. There’s always the possibility that he’ll find someone new. He did assure me that it would never happen and that I shouldn’t worry about that. I love him deeply and i’m pretty sure I want to spend the rest of my life with him. 

When I told my friends that i’m in a relationship with someone so young, they would say that they’re happy for me but I would often see that judgy look on their faces. Age gaps isn’t really an issue for me, but it isn’t the norm in SG so I tend to get negative reactions from other people. I would like to know what people think of such relationships esp if the guy is the younger party.

Did you two have sex???"" which is quite irritating and I would answer ""No"" every time. In her mind, I'm still a virgin but actually I lost it to him about 2 months ago. But why should I tell her that?? In fact, I don't want anyone to know unless they're a gynecologist or very close friends. To me, it's really nobody's business, and she's always telling me to save myself for marriage, so I also fear her response. Is it normal for parents to want to know about their kid's sex life???

He ""proposed"" to her but she paid for the bto deposit fully. He did not even contribute a single cent. Imagine being that bad of a guy that a girl would stomach the full loss of the bto deposit and not even bother to get a cent from him knowing that he is a hopeless soul. 

People know that you don't pay for your own food you post on Instagram. Hear say tells me your overseas trip was paid for in full by your ex as well. 

What kind of a sorry ass Is he to go around talking as if he lost the love of his life when all he did was lose a sugar mommy and is too ugly to ever have someone else pay for his shit ever again.

As neighbours, we have our fair share of crests and troughs in our relationship but suffice to say, we are on friendly terms with each other and would visit each other from time to time or during festive periods.

However, one sore point remains unresolved up till today. See, my neighbours love to barbecue while my family shuns barbecue because we think it’s carcinogenic. My neighbours also installed multiple barbecue pits in their houses so that they can carry out their seasonal barbecue. However, with barbecue comes the fumes, and more pits equals more fumes. It is so bad then whenever they carry out their seasonal barbecues, my family has to shut our windows and the smell lingers in our house for days. We have tried to persuade both neighbours not to install so many pits or to barbecue under a fume hood, but advice (and even offers of money to part sponsor fume hoods) have gone unheeded.  

Now, neighbour 1 has installed industrial scale pits. This caused even neighbour 2 to complain about the barbecue fumes and inviting neighbour 1 to counter accuse neighbour 2 of starting the barbecue fumes first. Meanwhile, all 3 families are suffering from the fumes with nary a solution in sight. My neighbours, especially neighbour 1, has a religious love for barbecue so it’s unlikely they will give up barbecuing anytime soon. Anyone has any good advice on dealing with such neighbours?

So... last night my gf and I decided to try out having sex. Both of us are virgins before that (under my best knowledge)

I gonna cut straight to the problem: 
Regardless how hard my gf tried to arouse my dxxx, I have no feelings; my d even gets soften when she gives handjob/ blowjob. 
At later stage, I decided to do it myself to have my d in working condition, then let her continue. However, problem is my erected d always got soften when she uses her hand/mouth or try to ride on me...

I was excited before the session but then so disappointed...

I am completely confused, I thought usually it’s much easier for woman to get a guy cum than the opposite.

We had foreplay and I was so surprised how easy my gf cums during our foreplay, considering that it’s just halfway and I haven’t clicked on the resonant frequency yet; also, I haven’t used my d yet...

Before you troll and think I have ED or other physiological or psychological issues, I gonna tell u that it’s unlikely the case.
My d works completely fine when I do it myself. It shouldn’t be size issue as well. I am not sure what the average size is for Singaporean, but since my gf cannot fully hold my erected d with both hands so it should be big enough, relative to her hands, mouth and v......

We tried again in the morning but my d still not responding to her... ???? 

My gf proposed another session but how if it always end up with she is so enjoyed but I am so disappointed?

Anyone had similar experience before and willing to share your sincere advice/solutions?

I'm a chinese dude, been seeing a really sweet malay girl for a month or so.
Thing is, my parents disapprove of her because she's muslim. Even though i've assured them i wont be converting for the sake of marriage, they insist i break off seeing her one on one.
My gf totally respects my choice not to convert, and we've both mutually agreed on the possibility of us not working out. 
So we've sort of agreed to be friends, not in a R/s. Also she's not those ""religious"" kind of muslim, which just puts in the grey area because there's a chance of us working out, albeit small.

Is it that bad/wrong to be seeing someone of a different race/religion? It's just sad that people still think this way. I'm at a loss because i dont even know if it's ME at fault here, or just my parents' preconception about interfaith-racial relationships. I don't want to be burning bridges over something like this.

Also since we've agreed on remaining as friends, is going out with someone of the opposite gender from time to time REALLY that unbelievable? My parents are going ape shit whenever i inform them we're going to see a movie/have a meal. They think we're still dating and that my surname's gonna get changed. Yes i understand they want to save me heartbreak in the future, but why can't they accept that we both already understand that, and are willing to take the chance that it might work out in the future?

No, lying isn't an option. I just wanna know how to get them to understand and see things from my perspective; that religion/race doesn't matter to ME even if it does to them. Am i being selfish? Am i in the wrong for even wanting to TRY to continue this R/S despite their disapproval?
Screw the world sometimes man, why can't things be simpler.

I mentioned that I broke up with my ex last month who is currently in ns. The guys at the table all objected and said that it was unfair/I was unfaithful to him/unwilling to put in the effort to sustain the relationship. The other girls however were all on my side. Even after the convo moved on I sensed that the guys all treated me more coldly afterwards.

I dont think that I was in the wrong in any way. I was not unfaithful (in fact I'm still single now), and I messaged him literally every day, and tried to arrange to meet up every weekend. But he messaged me back very slowly, and did not want to meet up on weekends because he said he was tired. As a result, I felt that my emotional needs were not being met and didn't want to be attached to a boyfriend in name only. The guys all thought that being too busy to reply/too tired to meet were valid excuses. Even if they are, the fact is that I still got to meet him in person only once or twice a month. I understand that ns is not a choice, life is unfair, but that doesnt mean that I should have to suffer an increasingly distant relationship as well. I should have the chance to find someone who can fulfil my relationship needs.

But the guys all think that girls should have the obligation to stick with their bfs for the whole two years, no matter how much of a joke the relationship becomes. That's why I'm posting this here: is this really a common view among singaporean guys? And is there any way you can defend these views, without sounding like the girl belongs to her bf?

COFN lets one half of the couple exit if a replacement can be found to form a family nucleus (eg parent, new lover etc) without the outgoing half losing the his/her half of the deposit. If you lost love, at least you don’t lose your money, and you can use that money to help you look for new love (dating ain’t cheap in Singapore yo). 

If you die die can’t find a replacement, just forfeit the deposit. You can earn the money back, but you can’t get back the time wasted in an unhappy marriage (at least for 3 years before the D).

A large proportion of the most intelligent students here in NUS rarely use social media (Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat etc.) Note that intelligence does not simply mean doing well academically or attaining FCH. These geniuses seem to have their priorities set straight and possess opinions of their own about anything under the sun. They are truly knowledgeable and focuses primarily on self-development and not grades. They are people who do not conform themselves to society's norm, in our case, publicizing their everyday life, but are nevertheless sociable and fun to talk to (high emotional intelligence). They are the humblest people of all who do not go around sharing their personal achievements, be it physically or via social media, and never, unlike smart aleck, disagree with others only to feed their ego.

On a side note, how many times have you encountered people bluntly disagreeing in a conversation to make themselves look smarter? These people are typically the average Joe who finds the need to humiliate others in order to alleviate their intellectual inferiority.

2724,"At the tender age of 8, I was molested by a relative. It didn’t go further than that because he was thwarted by someone returning home. I escaped to safety.

But I no longer felt safe.

I was consumed by shame, insecurity and fear. I didn’t dare tell anyone about the incident, because I felt like I had asked for it. I’d asked for it by being in the exact spot at that exact time. I’d asked for it by freezing up and not retaliating. I felt like I was complicit ー that I’d allowed myself to be violated. I was afraid that if I reported him, I’d ruin my family. I was afraid that I’d be accused of lying. I was afraid that, somehow, someone would be able to tell that this had happened to me, and they’d know how dirty and broken I was was.

And so I survived the only way I knew how, alone, lonely. I suppressed my emotions and the incident. I breathed no word of it. I escaped through reading. However, from time to time, it’d come back to haunt me. I would be consumed by feelings of fear, unworthiness, shame, guilt and brokenness. I developed many negative coping mechanisms due to my fear of abandonment and need to control everything. These mechanisms developed as I felt helpless from the incident, and was determined not to be rendered that way any longer. These mechanisms resulted in toxic behaviours.

I spent my teenage years people-pleasing, pretending that I was introverted and hence didn’t like socialising. In fact, I was desperate for love and validation. I was always the cheerful one, the dramatic and animated one, the funny one. Even when I was crying and depressed inside, I had on my mask. I was always described as “vivacious” and “bubbly”. I didn’t allow people to get to know the real me, for fear they’d discover how broken and unworthy of love I was. And so, I skipped gatherings and social events. In my way, I rejected others before I could be rejected. 

Many times, I thought of ending my own life. But I never did. Why? When I was 14, I met some very special people. These people showed me that they were willing to love me, warts and all. I finally found people I could speak my truth to. Instead of the judgement I expected, I was received with love and compassion. I was heard and seen, not as a victim, but as a survivor.

20 years have gone past. This year, I finally gained the courage to come out to my parent about the incident. I chose to speak up, as I knew that I wanted to begin my healing process. I no longer wanted to just be a survivor, I wanted to be healed. I was met, not with judgement, but with love and compassion.

I’ve begun seeing a therapist and also journalling to process my trauma. There are good days, and there are bad days. Some days I get triggered so badly and anxiety attacks hit me hard. Thankfully, there are more good days than bad days, of late.

I wrote this entire post, feeling peaceful and anxiety-free.

Thanks for coming to my TEDtalk and allowing me to reclaim my narrative.

I hope my story shows people who have shared my struggles that all of you are seen and heard. I hope my story becomes a page in your survival guide. I hope my story brings you hope today ー that you can still build a beautiful life after trauma, that there are still wonderful humans who will hold space for ALL OF YOU, no matter how broken you might perceive yourself, and that it’s never too late to heal.

Above all, I hope my story inspires you to be a little bit more empathetic and compassionate today. Some wounds are invisible, but that doesn’t make them any less real.

The fact of constant spamming calls and my mom shouting over the phone at me to ask me to get back home to send my brother to see the doctor just saddens and annoy me so much that i didn't felt peace at all when i was in church. I felt so miserable and no one can ever understand this struggle. Why cant my mom (she is healthy ok) just bring him to the doctor? I dont get it. Her excuse was she have to wake up for work later at 7am and she didn't wanted to wait since the consult hours can stretch till the wee hours.  It's not the first time that my mom keep spamming me with calls (its like 10 calls in 10 min kind) and will keep calling till you pick up, just so to tell you to come back quickly to attend to my brother emergency.

Even if I join the others, there is a chance that they may switch auditors after the 5 years of appointment are over. Would joining a mid tier firm make more sense? 

Asking here instead of SUSS confessions because it's more active. Thanks.

2735,"When people hear about my CAP, they think I'm smart, but I'm actually a complete imposter. I strategically plan my modules and plan my S/Us. And I make digital notes from my textbook notes, and then make lecture notes which are actually just summaries of the textbook again. 

And yet I still get Bs for certain assignments- not due to a lack of effort, but because I misunderstood the task. And that is even likelier when the prof is the unstructured sort to treat studying like some kind of fun lark and doesn't expect you to be hung up over assignments and grades. 

But I am hung up over it. I got a B for my first assignment back this sem, and I got so upset that I stopped talking to anyone for 3 days and stopped eating for that time too. When I broke my fast, I just ate everything in sight and felt so disgusted. 

I know actually-smart people don't do this, and that they do treat studying like some kind of fun lark, with their As being some kind of neat perk that just arrives along the way. They don't stop eating because they got a B, since they don't even get a B in the first place. I want to be that sort of person so bad, but I'm not.

And I think everyone can tell. I'm currently blinded by jealousy that my friend is getting research opportunities despite having a much lower CAP than me (neither of us have prior experience, although we are in different majors). So I think the profs can clearly tell that even though I have much better grades, it's all phoney, so the opportunities go to other people.

You said you don't like sending nudes, but all the nude pics you sent him are selfies.
You said you didn't like to give blowjobs, but half the videos I saw were you giving it to him.
You said you don't like anal, but the man's semen has been inside there before.

At least half of the sexual activity you had was with that man... And by fate I just had to know all of that.

2739,"Sorry in adv for the long post but I needed to get this off my chest and I’m scared my friends will judge me if I tell them.

Ive been with my ex-boyf, let’s call him G, since the start of Y1. We study diff subjects but I always made time to spend with him no matter how busy I got during lunch or wtv (I’m from a fac where the schedule is very hectic). In return he would always buy me food and pay for stuff. We applied for overseas exchange tgt and we got our same first choice of uni (in europe), and we made alot of plans to go travelling and stuff.

Truth is that as soon as I got accepted I started thinking of reasons to dump him. I just really wanted a angmoh boyf. I know it sounds bad but it’s like, G already got to have me to himself for 2 years and I was very loyal to him the whole time. I never even looked at any other guy and never went out with guys alone. I only get the chance to go on exchange once in my life and I didnt want to be burdened with something I chose in Y1, especially since it was so long ago.

So 1 week before we flew over (we bought tickets tgt) I changed my flight to an earlier one and broke up with G. I tried to be nice and I even had sex with him one last time before I left his place. Afterward he kept trying to text me and beg me to patch back but I didnt reply him.

Fast forward a week and I was settling in at the uni (not going to say which one incase people guess who I am) and I met this really hot angmoh, let’s call him B. B had short blonde hair and blue eyes like the waters of Bali. He was also taller than G (at least 180cm – I’m only 167 and G was 172) and had a very muscular chest and shoulders. When I first saw him I was like omgggggggg I literally died and came back to life and died again!!

He started talking to me on the first day of lectures and we instantly hit it off. He was so funny, and he understood me so well. It was perfect. When he asked me to hang out outside of class I immediately jumped at the chance! One day we went back to my room and started making out. I felt this attraction Ive never felt with G or any other SG guy before. After a few days we had sex for the first time. I was so shocked because I had never gone to homerun with anyone so fast before but we had this amazing connection, but it felt so right. I have always been a feminist and I wanted to be more sex-positive. I came from a very traditional background and my parents always wanted me to save myself. In the end I wanted to prove that this is my body, so I did a lot of ‘dirty’ things with B that I never even thought about doing with G.

As time went on I started seeing B less and less, and when we met it was always me going over to his house for sex. Sometimes he didnt use protection and just pulled out. I started getting angry with him and demanded to know where he was but he would start ignoring me. I didnt want to admit to myself that he was just using me, so I tried using the same tactics I used on G when we were together.

Soon B started avoiding me and in my sadness I messaged G again, thinking he would be desperate to get back tgt with me (he used to talk about BTO and kids so often it really freaked me out). When he didnt reply my repeated messages I stalked his insta and found out he got a angmoh girlf! They post all these gross couple workout videos and seeing him with her made me feel sick. I dont even know why she would be with him. He’s slightly shorter than her and his dick isn’t that big (I should know). And its not my fault that I wanted to try something new. G was so boring and he cant compete with B’s looks. I didnt even think angmohs would be interested in SG guys (she’s really very pretty).

Should I confront her for stealing him, even though I know that I broke up with him first? I’m really very conflicted and I feel so stupid and used. When I first saw their photos I let my anger get the better of me and I messaged G’s parents telling them that he dumped me for some angmoh slut. He didnt tell them about us so they got very angry and scolded him (they’re also very traditional). He messaged me yst and said that not just was he never going to talk to me again, but he never wanted to date a singaporean girl ever again because ‘european girls are so much better in every way’. I now know I was wrong, but I dont know what to do to fix it and I still want G back.

I can get her to do literally anything in bed and satisfies me to my every need. I unfortunately have this urging physical sexual crush on one of her girlfriends who is really hot and cute. I’ve only made small conversations with her, but I don’t know if shes being nice or just flirting with me.

As a man I cant stop my sexual urges, but when I fantasize about her friend in particular, it just feels amazing. I don’t want a relationship with her and she never bring any guys around us. She does like to party but doesn’t give herself to any guy.

The worst thing is shes been friends with my girlfriend for a long time, and they are like best friends. Its nice we all love the same music so that’s a great bonding and they are both very smart. 
I really don’t want to hold this feeling inside anymore but I also don’t want to ruin my good relationship.

I am really scared that if I say “Hey I think you’re hot, lets have sex” or something around those lines, she could immediately go back to my gf n bam, now I lost both women.

I need some advice on this.. How do you go about this situation? I want to be able to ask subtle hints to her and see how it plays out. As a guy I do think she likes me but may not ever engage in sexual activity with me because of the fact im dating her friend. I just want to ask her and make sure she doesn’t tell my girlfriend.

Anyways, this time we coincidentally got into the same school and same course. I don’t know if it’s fated or what but we are currently in the same clique too. After spending almost 5out of 7 days with the clique, I could sense that she really liked another guy and I got sort of jealous. I could also tell that she didn’t want to let others know about our childhood as she doesn’t address me the same way we always did before school starts - she would always call me “(my name) kor kor”. But because of this, I purposely teased her and call her how I usually do - “Qi Qi”. This is what all of our friends and family call her since young. Although she got irritated and mentioned not to call her that name, I actually felt delighted and accomplished. Like the guy she likes doesn’t have that privilege to do so.

I have been with my bf for close to a year, and he is my first. And there's this girl( girl x) that he have been constantly texting with. I happened to know about it a few months back when i saw him texting her when we were out together. Personally i know girl x too, she is the gf of one of our friend(both my bf and mine). At first i didn't ask my bf about it, cause i thought they were just casually chatting, but i was surprised that they even do chat as i thought they weren't that close to have each other's number. 

Then the second time when i saw him texting her (also when we were hanging out), i ask him about it. At that point of time he told me it's because girl x and our friend had some problems in their relationship, and our friend actually asked him to help talk to girl x. He also ensure me that he wont text her that much from then. I believe him and was relieved, because now i know the reason behind him texting her. But at the back of my heart i know i still feel a bit uncomfortable about it. 

And recently, i realised my bf text girl x more. And before i ask my bf anything, he told me that girl x had broke up with our friend (our friend was in wrong). I feel sorry for girl x and i know my bf is just trying to help them. He have always been nice and love helping his friends. I know him, and that there's nothing going on between him and girl x. But i just feel uncomfortable that they are texting everyday. I did told my bf about it and we are trying to fix this situation.

2750,"Just wanted to get something off my chest. 

I'm a Y2 student this year, and I find that university life is quite lonely and meaningless. I find that I don't have much to look forward to every morning when I wake up, except, well, for the need to study, participate in class and hopefully achieve decent grades.

I have to say that I do not have many friends. Most are acquaintances, whom I only talk to in tutorials. Other than that, I have zero social life. Honestly, sometimes I quite enjoy the solitude since I can spend time alone catching up on my academic/non-academic stuff. But sometimes I wish I had a friend to rant about my lousy day to. 

I'd like to think that I'm close to this friend of mine, but I realised that I've always just been a spare for her. I only come to mind when she doesn't have anyone else to accompany her. And I feel disgusted at myself for constantly being manipulated by her even though I know of her personality. I've just been realising how toxic she is recently (she believes people who score below a B+ are ""stupid"", and I really quote this ad verbatim) and I feel extremely stressed out by her. But maybe this is how I maintain some semblance of a social life.

And yes, I do join CCAs. But no one really takes the initiative to contact one another outside of CCA hours. 

People have told me that I do not 'seem' approachable and friendly towards others, so I try really hard to initiate conversation with others, so much so that I feel really tired of myself. I don't feel like myself and I don't even know who I am. Maybe I am trying too hard. 

And I am sorry if some people think that I ""try too hard"" by doing my weekly readings on time and revising the content taught weekly. I am not trying to impress anyone, I just don't want to cram and study everything at the last minute. I didn't think it was offensive to place academics in high regard. 

I feel so alone in school. I even feel sad when I see the UHC emails on World Suicide Prevention day, because I identify with the content so much.

I have been together with my bf since poly, and we have both grad from uni and are working now. I can say he is generous and sweet towards me — pays for meals, goes the extra mile to show interest in my hobbies (even when I can tell he’s not too keen haha), etc. Overall, it looks like there’s nothing to complain about, and there is the kind of stability you mention in some of your relationship advice. However, there are some times (like, almost predictably every 4-6 months) when he walks out on me whenever we have a minor argument, or if i say something that accidentally triggers him (even though i don’t think it is really offensive, just being honest with what I think). On top of making me feel bad (but I’m slowly getting more numb to it lately), I think these walk-outs are quite immature. If I try to have a mature conversation about this, he will continue to stonewall me or change the topic.I can tell that he is uncomfortable (rather than intentionally trying to hurt me), so I have been dropping it. My feeling is that he walks out due to his inability/too tired to deal with the situation.  I am not sure if these incidents are worth tolerating in a long-term relationship, especially since it seems that they can be predictable. Would like to seek your insight and advice for my situation!

We loved each other a lot, and even have plans for our future, getting BTO etc. However, things turned for the worst ever since we hit the 1 year mark, where we started to see compaitability issues, different outlook in life. But we tried our best to resolve them, or rather we would just leave it to be. He would often MIA when we start talking about this problem, coming out with excuses to avoid these serious talks. And leave me hanging or upset for the rest of the night.

He went for his exchange earlier this year and mine started on the later half of the year. We had no chance to meet at all as it overlaps, and hence it increased the frequency of our arguments. It surrounded mainly on how I am not prioritising him when he is the one who had no time for me (we only facetime once a month or not at all). He started thinking about a future that is according to his goals, his interest, and not me. What is the most important is, he never provided me the emotional support and I find myself going to someone else instead when in difficult situations. We have very different values. He often say he love me, but never actually act like he do.

So I decided that we had to take a break, that perhaps we will both reflect and be more accepting of our differences, since after all we really do love each other a lot. I brought that up and since then, it was the last time we talked, there was no closure, nothing.

But rather than trying to find a way to solve this, he immediately started using all the dating apps, hooking up with girls and going out on dates searching for a new partner. This isn't considered cheating but to be honest, it didn't feel really good. I took the time to heal and hoping we can get back together or find a way out of this, but all he did was give up on the relationship.

When you tell them to lower their volume, they would casually laugh it off and continue their game. In the end, those who wish to study are indirectly forced to vacate these tutorial classrooms. It is especially infuriating when they neither book the classroom nor were they the initial occupants in these classrooms. This has been going on for the past few weeks and they are getting noisier.

When I raise my unhappiness, everybody tells me its a small thing and I should treat my sister better because I am older. I feel helpless. Am I wrong for feeling this way? I want to love my family but increasingly, I find it hard to do so. I don't feel like I am respected as a family member.

Like fooling around having fun times in JC and the bonds you make during NS(doing shit together, getting into trouble together, having random deep talks about life)

Close friends seems to have moved on with life(like I feel that they are no longer that close as they seem to be busy to meet up and take a long time to reply or even don't reply sometimes) even though we were inseparable just a year ago.

I guess nothing ever stays the same?

I found out after the fight that she actually went on a dating app and started talking to some of the guys after our fight.
When we met up after the fight, I saw these guys popping up on her phone and asked her who they were. She Simply brushed them off as her ‘friends’. 
I told her that I felt insecure, as a whole list of guys suddenly started talking to her right after our fight and she told me not to worry, as she will never seek attention from any other guys and that she really loves me.
Honestly right now I just cannot understand why she did what she did and why didn’t she just tell me the truth? I wouldn’t forgive her and move on as it feels better than being lied to.

2776,"Been in a relationship for 1 year plus. I know its rather short for people out there, but small conflicts have started to surface. My girlfriend is a very independent lady. Since both of us are in uni now, though different schools, I always try to make and effort to study with her. She loves studying at the National Library in bugis as she mentioned that the table there is huge, lights are bright, many seats and its located near her house. However, i live near Pasir Ris park and travelling to bugis is rather inconvenient. I tried to compromise with her, probably going to a library where it will be more accessible for both parties, but she is too stubborn to give in. She even mentioned that she is alright to study by herself, as both of us are doing vastly different courses and we cannot possibly talk in the library. 

Anyways, moving on, we have been dating for more than a year, but she hasn't met any of my friends. Not even my best friends. They've only heard of her from me and saw her pictures on my instagram but none of them ever saw her irl. They thought i hallucinated on having a girlfriend lol. She just doesn't seem to be interested in socialising with my circle of friends. I mean she was like this all the while, even before we dated and I'm quite licky i got to be her boyfriend considering the number of people she interact with on a daily basis. Although she also doesn't interfere with my social life, which may cause other guys to be jealous, since i have a couple of close fenale friends too, she doesn't seem to be too bothered. She doesn't check my phone or get suspicious whenever i goes to the club etc. Not that i have cheated on her but it just seems like she doesn't give a shit about me. My guy friends would occasionally bring their girlfriends out for dinner but me, eventhough attatched, is always alone, being the 3rd wheeler.

Sometimes i wonder if I'm too clingy. Or is it because I'm too ugly (which i honestly don't think so), hence she feels too secure whenever I'm out alone as no girls would prey on me.

2777,"Amidst all the troll, relationship and faith-in-human lost confessions here, I'd like to share something positive, and hopefully encouraging. I just graduated from NUS this year, but it's only now that I feel ready to share my story. 

I grew up in a single-parent family with my mom and little sister. Throughout primary school, I was doing decently well in school and my CCAs. We weren't rich, but we survived just fine as a family. 

Everything changed during secondary school when my mom was first diagnosed with cancer. When I first heard the news, all I could think of was 'why me?'. It felt like god was being unfair towards me. I was not a saint, but I did my best to live my life honestly and did everything as right as I could. Yet, this had to happen to me. From then on, my life started to go downhill. I started skipping school, my grades suffered, mixed around with the wrong company, and committed petty crimes. 

My mom had no idea all these were happening because half the time, she was in the hospital and my teachers avoid bothering her with these news because they do not want her to experience additional stress. But finally, I was arrested by the police for shoplifting. I could never forget the look on her face when I saw her while she was bailing me out. Beneath the wrinkles, paleness and tiredness on her face, her disappointment was apparent. She was weak, in a wheelchair and was supposed to go for her usual check up that day. But she missed it because of me. 

I realised that I was being selfish the whole time. I realised that I was thinking about myself and my own suffering, without realising that my mom was the one who was suffering the most. Additionally, my sister was starting to be influenced by me because her teacher called me and informed me that she had skipped school without an MC or letter. 

I soon picked myself up, took my N levels, and scored well enough to take the O levels. My mom's condition started to get better as well. I stopped hanging out with bad company, and my teachers helped by giving me tuition in their free time. 

I took my O levels. I had the goal of going to a good JC. But it was my second last O level paper, when one of my teacher approached me after the end of the paper. She told me the news. That my mom had passed away while I was taking the exam. My whole came crashing down again. 

With that news, I could not focus on my last paper the next day. I did not score well enough to go to the JC I wanted, and ended up going to Poly. My life, once again, went downhill. It felt pointless to keep trying. It felt like I tried my best to be good, yet life just was not fair towards me. And with my mom gone, I did not have the motivation to study anymore. 

While waiting for the Poly semester to start, I went through one of my darkest period. I was contemplating death every single day. There were some nights when I was very close to going through with my suicide plan. 

What got me out of it was during one of those suicidal nights, I entered my sister's bedroom to put a note on her desk. She did not hear not hear me coming in, and I heard what sounded like crying noise. You see, my sister never cried or showed much emotions. During my mom's funeral, there was no expression on her face. But that day, hearing her cry, I realised that she was hurting just as much as I am. And if I were to die, the pain I experienced would not just end with me. It's be transferred to my sister, and that was the most selfish thing I could do.

I started to have a new motivation in live. My sister. I pulled through poly, juggling with a part-time banquet job during the weekends. And just like that, I made it through poly, and into university because of my good grades. 

We had some help from our relatives, but it was never enough for us. My sister needed school supplies, and I needed textbooks and to pay off my poly tuition fee. My social life was not the best, because I could not keep up with going out with the clique every week and spending money with them when they choose to eat pricier food. Fortunately, I made a few good friends who understood my situation. They always opt for budget options, or insisted on paying for me. One of them had a sibling who was studying in the same secondary school as my sister and was a year older, and he gave me his sibling's old textbooks, supplies and even school uniform. 

There were times when I felt like I was going downhill again, but when I looked back at how far I came, I find the courage to continue on. From someone who was arrested for shoplifting, to someone studying at NUS.

This year, I finally graduated. I was not the best in my cohort, with only a second-lower class, but it meant a lot that I graduated. 

On my graduation day, I did not attend the ceremony. Instead, I went to the place where my mom's urn was kept, in my graduation gown (I didn't care that people were staring), and stayed there while the ceremony was going on. That day was the closest I've ever felt to my mom. She always told me her biggest regret in life was not getting an education and did not want her children to meet with the same regret. I hope that wherever she is, she'd be proud. 

Someday, I hope to go back to school and get a masters or phd. But for now, the best option is to find work first, because I want my sister to go through life a little more comfortably than I did. But someday, I'll make my mom even prouder.

I don’t know if girl A will read this because she also follows NUSWhispers. I like her. She is smart, interesting, and beautiful, all rolled into one.

My main issue is whether I should confess to girl A.

My other issues are if a girl says she wants to break up: 1) has she already made up her mind? (Btw, she is still with him though); 2) why wouldn’t she just tell the bf herself?

2781,"This story is based off my cousin's relationship. She is 25 now and her husband is the same age as her. They have been married for about 1 and a half years now and have a baby of 7 months old too. 
Before they got married,her husband (then bf) cheated on her twice in the span of 4 years. Both times he was caught by her and he had promised to change.
Come the day that he proposed, which was also the day that my cousin thought ""ok he is serious with this relationship and he will definitely change"" 
Sadly that was not the case. Fast forward 6 months into the marriage things started to turn sour. As they are awaiting for their rental flat to get approved they have both been staying at my cousin's family home. Fights about privacy,money,time together,starting a family started to arise. Keep in mind that these are also being made known to my auntie and basically the whole family as their fights take place in her house since they live there. No signs of improvement on his end but she still believed its just stresses of newly-weds and it will fade away one day. Turns out,he had also turned to alcohol to ""drown his stresses"" which made my cousin more heartbroken,nights where she can't sleep awaiting her husband to come home,needing to ensure he is home safe and hopes he doesn't cause a scene at home when he is drunk.
Fast forward and they had a baby,she thought after giving birth to their child,things will stabilise (they have their own flat now)
But recently she found out that he had another girl behind her back for a few months (this was while she was pregnant) and he basically told his ""girlfriend"" or bootycall that he is single and his wife is just his best friend.
My cousin is of devastated but he promises that the fling only went on for 2 months and he felt guilty and has since ended things with the girl.
We have all advised her to step away from this man but she is lost and doesn't want her baby to grow up without a father or have a broken family. Please #help we are lost too

2783,"Continuing from #69308: let me clarify. I've known this guy for years now, and we run occassionally and meet up to catch up for meals sometimes. We don't even text often, maybe once in a while to check out the other party is doing. I've seen him all along as a platonic friend that's all. So when he suggested just having a drink (with other mutual friends) I clearly don't see the harm in that?! FYI I paid for my own drinks. I live otw to his place, so I would think it's normal for us to share a ride home. This is the first time he ever made any sort of physical advances on me. We don't even flirt via text or anything of that sort so I'm really confused when he tried to hug and kiss me. I pushed him away but right now, I'm feeling quite hurt because it seems like he never once treasured our friendship to even attempt something like this. 

I'm even more confused by the fact that it wasn't too long ago that he asked me about my boyfriend and I already told him we had recently BTO and how much I was looking forward to settle down with him.

I am hurt because of how I am treated by someone I see as a friend and I want to understand if this is something normal because ""he's drunk"" ""all guys think with their dicks"" and whether I should really cut this friendship off for good. It would pain me because I've enjoyed the occasional intellectual conversations we have, running together, and basically just having a friend for company! I am simply trying to understand why he did the things he did but I really couldn't comprehend his actions. Is there a simple reason to this I'm failing to see?

I dropped him a text subsequently to tell him that I didn't agree with his actions and I would like to remain only as friends, and we haven't been talking ever since. I'm sad because either way, I feel like I've lost a friend and I don't even know what I did wrong. I did not tell my boyfriend about this because I don't want him to worry for me or worse, tell me to stop hanging out with my guy friends because well, I do find myself clicking better with guys and I have quite a lot of guy friends. 

Any advice on what I should do? This is an honest and genuine post. I'm feeling sad and confused and lost but I can't even share any of this with my boyfriend!

I've been logging into insta using the new account I'd made a few days after we parted, so as to check up on your daily stories etc for over a year. Sadly, nothing has been posted until today. A picture of you and your new boyfriend popped up my screen. I really dont know how I should be feeling, maybe sad? Nope, because i know you've most probably managed to walk out of the gloomy days and better days await you. Happy? Not really, because I realise that I still love you and regretted what I've done that hurt you in the past, when you were still mine.

But I guess simply seeing me would reminds you of out past memories which would be best to for you to forget. So I know you'd probably not be seeing this, but I just want to say something I've been yearning to convey to you for the past 1 year plus - I'm sorry and I love you.

Im sorry I cheated on you with your best friend. You told him to check up on me while you were gone. Telling him to make friends with me and hang out more. Maybe it was cos you didn't trust me and thought I'd go out looking for side action. But I've always been faithful to you. Just that this time, I couldn't. 
You introduced me to him when we first started getting serious. I've always found him hot. His muscles, the way his nose wrinkles when he laughs, the way his eyes light up whenever he's talking about his passions, the fact that he's just a little taller than me. It's hard to meet guys who are taller than me. I knew I was going to fall for him. That's why I always tried to stay away. I tried to give you two your space and let you hang out. He even thought I hated him. He never knew why I had to stay away.
You never knew I am gay. He didn't either. Nothing gave it away. Sure you and I used to check out guys together and comment on them but other boyfriends who are comfortable enough with themselves do it too. It was one of our many bonding activities. You and I are still together but I can't let you know the real reason why our physical intimacy doesn't go beyond second base, why I spend so much time at the gym, why I am so much happier now, why most of the time  your best friend and I are both limping around campus.

2794,"Recently my boyfriend of two years became an avid pokemon fan. We both share an intellectually similar sense of humor where our laughter thrives on puns, references and inside jokes. In a quest to spice up our bedroom activities, he thought it would he funny to make pokemon puns mid-sex, which honestly kills off the mood for me but I do not wish to ruin his moment. Since he is not in NUS, I'll just openly say it. During one of our recent sessions, foreplay begain with going something along the lines of ""baby, your neh sibei Jigglypuffs, limpeh ready to put my Charmander inside you."" I wasn't a huge fan of it, but nevertheless tuned it out and sex commenced. Here's some context: both me and my boyfriend bring out the best in each other's sexual prowess, we've been trying out karmasutra positions to make things a little more interesting, with my favorite positions including splitting the bamboom, the milk and water embrace etc. to name a few. According to google theres somewhere along 245 to 300 of these positions, and ever since he became an avid Pokemon fan he would begin every session by claiming that ""we gotta catch em' all"" (try all 245 of the positions). We used to play pop music in the background but ever since the Pokemon thing all he does is blast the Pokemon theme sont ON A LOOP, when it comes to the part where it goes ""I will travel across the land, Searching far and wide. Each Pokemon to understand,The power that's inside!"" he points at my nether region and goes down on me, every once in awhile raising his head to ask ""if I had Squirtle"". It's been so frustrating that every session ends with me completing losing every ounce of sexual energy I once had, even though Pokemon means the world to him."" I even suggested a compromise, that perhaps we could go with a less odd animation cartoon to roleplay when under the sheets, particularly Peppa Pig, because we could at worse, oink in bed, and that isn't anywhere half as horrible as Pokemon puns. Still, he did his research, watched an episode of Peppa Pig and during our session, pointed to his little brother before adopting the british Peppa Pig voice and going ""I'm A Wiggly Worm, I'm A Wiggly Worm! How Do You Do? I Love You! I'm A Wiggly Worm! *Snort*"" as a reference to one of the episodes. I just about lost it. I know communication is key and everything so I voiced my concerns to him but he took one last jab at me and used our karmasutra positions as an inside reference to break up with me, telling me that ""If you don't wish to split the bamboo while accepting my Pokemon jokes, then we're splitting up"". I have no idea how to patch things up with him for I do love him dearly but our sex life has been nowhere near fulfilling for the longest time. Tell me, should I change my sheets to a Pokemon themed one and dress myself as Peppa Pig for halloween in an attempt to salvage my relationship? Should we have sex again I'll probably stuff in some ear buds and try to focus on his Charmander going in and out of me I suppose.

Was a tough period of time, I recall that when I went for my NS heart checkup, the nurse was scanning my chest and it felt like a hug and I nearly broke down. I thought I had forgotten about such warmth and comfort but I was wrong. From then I managed to get through by doing things that will relieve stress. For me it's crying, although most people feel that guys shouldn't cry but I choose to cry as it is my coping mechanism.

2. How are the classes being streamed? Do they put students with good grades in one tutorial class and the ones with the bad grades will be in the last tutorial class? 

3. Are relationships common in NUS? My son has always been enrolled into boys school so I need not worry about that. But I’m scared he’ll find a gf in NUS and I want to avoid that because I think he should only start dating when he graduated from his degree, or hopefully his masters programme. 

4. Every Thursday, my son tells me that he has no school on that day. I find it hard to believe and I think he’s skipping school. 

5. My son has not shown me any of his homework or test marks for my signature. He told me that his courses only have exams and group projects, and do not require my signature. This is ridiculous. How else can i make sure he’s doing his work?

2804,"Hi Prof Ben, 
This is entirely unrelated to cs but I’m a physics major who has no idea what in the world I’m doing here. I chose physics cos in JC, I somehow ended up doing physics Olympiad, and those questions from then were really hard and I happen to quite enjoy challenges. 
So fast forward few years, I’m now majoring in physics, and I quite enjoy what I do now. Most exams are pretty fun, and following the proofs from lecture notes etc keeps me entertained. But, I’m a downright awful experimentalist, and I don’t feel like I have any real interest in physics.(my classmates get excited about black holes and quantum tech and whatnot, but I honestly don’t care)
So, I’m still in year 2, with quite a while till I graduate, but I think my life is going in a wrong direction. I don’t think real physics suits me. Am I wrong? Could I get some advise on what to do going forward? Thanks!

2805,"I am someone with strong craving for intimacy with my girl. Here comes the problem:

She told me that she would limit the intimacy to no more than a kiss and has a stupid traditional thinking of having sex  only after  marriage. As such I have turned to the Geylang beauties to satisfy my inner desires now and then. Eventually, it became a bad habit to a point that my withdrawal syndrome will kick in if i dont do it for a day.

Few days ago its' my birthday and  she had prepared a feast for me and waited for me at my house. However I lied to her that I had to OT my work and she didnt mind and reheated the food. The actual fact was that I was actually spending time with an escort.


When she found out the truth, she was livid and wanted to break up with me! Isnt it her fault for sticking to her traditional thinking?

I know I should. But I'm compensating for my terrible self-esteem, I'm distracting myself (I don't know from what, self-hate?), I'm always anxious about the future, and I've always been a bad person to begin with.

2817,"This is my personal Uni story. I admittedly did not do as well as people thought I would for the A Levels. I think everyone silently acknowledges that the A Levels were a tough time. I still remember the last words my form teacher said to me as he handed me my A Level transcript, a kind of disappointed resignation: ""What happened?""

I entered my desired course with A Level results placed at the bottom 10% of the cohort. Still, I started my first day of school wide-eyed and excited - ultimately, I had gotten my first choice. I was so full of hope. This would be nothing like the A Levels. I would start everything on a clean slate. Because this is a course with elements that I genuinely liked without all the bullshit ""other subjects"" to worry about, and because of all the additional freedoms that came with being a Uni student. I would do well in this.

You kinda already know how this goes. Despite putting in all the hours, studying 10 - 10 at school with my course mates, getting in with the grind, I was scoring nowhere near as well as the people around me were, and I put the blame on everything but myself. The bell curve god, the lecturers who just wanted to see how many people could get 0 on an ""MCQ"" test, the study environment, all your usual suspects. Sure I went through the motions, but it just never worked for me. I didn't see the Youtube ""breaks"" that turned into hour long escapades, the irrational dependency on my study buddies. The problems I thought I could leave behind with the A Levels came back to haunt me in this new chapter.

It all changed after I entered a long distance relationship, but this isn't about the love story. The LDR changed my perspective on how I could make things work. I started looking less at what I couldn't control, and more on what I could. I picked up the habit of studying with friends outside of my Uni circle, and slowly transitioned to studying alone. This helped my anxiety immensely, because I was working at my own pace and not others'. Although I wasn't improving by leaps and bounds, I was improving with much more ease. I eventually managed to secure a decent CAP, and a decent job.

Something I've learnt from watching Masterchef for several years: it's only a good show when you play to win, not when you play to survive.

2822,"I've been dating this girl for 3 years now. We've had insane sex in every single imaginable position, style or way during those first few months, up to ten times a day.

I really like this girl. But recently, the sex has become painfully boring to me. I used to enjoy it quite a lot, I very much looked forward to it, but now, it's become a routine I don't particularly enjoy. I find myself rather playing video games than having sex, which is very, very weird to me, as I'm the type of guy that would travel 2 hours for fifteen minutes of sex anytime. This is my first long relationship, and I'm unsure whether something like this is even normal - she literally needs to be laying on top of me, naked, for me to even get aroused. I used to pop boners just by looking at her.

I don't want to break up with her, but sex plays an important role in my life 

So the question is, what should I do to bring that old spice back? Any ideas, tips, suggestions? I don't want to pursue another relationship, nor do I want to risk this girl by cheating on her (although that would definitely solve the sex issue).

TL;DR, My Girlfriend doesn't attract me sexually anymore, but I really, really like being with her. What can I do to bring the old spice back?

You can't fill up the void with hobby. You can only fill up the void causes by lack of intimacy with intimacy. Here is an analogy:

In Power Rangers Wild Force, the Lion Megazord became ill after forming the Wild Force Megazord Double Knuckle mode. 

The solution was not to have Giraffe Zord or Elephant Zord being the replacement for Lion Zord as they aren't meant to be body of the Megazord. It is true that they can help to reduce the problem, but they aren't permanent solution. Similarly, having a hobby does help in keeping you occupied, but it isn't a long term solution.

The practical solution is to find another body Megazord which is the Gorilla Zord.

To make things worst, my gf broke up with me over the weekend. I am just in this really deep depression hell hole right now. Was suppose to complete a lot work over the weekend, but nothing was done. I cant bring myself to focus on studies.

I dont know what to do, quite lost especially now with so much work undone and deadlines coming up, and i was suppose to catch up on last week's lectures which i didnt so i am in trouble this week.  I dont even know where to get started to fix everything. Feels like i am going to fail this sem. I took 4core mods this sem to make things worst. Feel like a total failure in life, feels like its all my fault. I really want to pick myself up, but i just cant find the drive to totally. I just want to give up. My mind is telling me to just do that. I am not suicidal, but I am really lost in life right now and overwhelmed to the point that i just want to give up and do nothing.

Ever since my previous girlfriend broke up with me in 2016, I have had crushes on 7 girls out of which none of them have been interested in me and I have been friendzoned by all of them and hence they haven’t evolved past the stage of ‘crushes’. 

My problem is that when I do have a crush on someone, this feeling very quickly develops into an obsession, a very unhealthy obsession with that person. And this results in a few consequences. 

Firstly, either when I get rejected or when I find out she isn’t interested in me or when I find that she appears to be more interested in someone else, my mental health really takes a toll. I get depressed. And it really affects my ability to function normally. 

Secondly, the obsession also makes me do things that I don’t want to do and wouldn’t normally do. Obsessively stalking people on social media, getting seriously jealous of other people around her. It also causes me to try and make her like me, which could potentially cause her to feel uncomfortable. I know these are wrong, but I can’t seem to control myself.

Thirdly, I get way too intense way too fast. I start dreaming about potential futures we might share together, romantic moments we might share if we were together and my mind runs out of control. This happens to the extent that thoughts of her would occupy my mind every moment I am awake and prevents me from concentrating on anything else.       

I need help. I can’t seem to control how I think or how I feel. There is only so much I can do to suppress these feelings and emotions. I don’t want to live like this anymore. These obsessions not only hurt me but also make the girl feel uncomfortable and I feel terrible about that. There is only so much I can do to control the extent to which I act on these obsessions. What do I do? How do I stop feeling this way? I’ve had this issue for the last 4 years and I am tired of having to go through this cycle over and over again.

For some context, I have been single for the last 4 years. I am someone who is emotionally quite empty. I have a void that I am hoping a relationship can fix (although I have been told that this doesn’t work). I have come to realise is that what I actually may be in love with is the idea of a relationship and not necessarily the person I would be in a relationship with. I have been told that the solution to this is to first love myself and to fill the void in me before I get into a relationship. 

But  my question is, how exactly do I love myself? What does loving oneself look like? What steps do people take in order to ‘love themselves’ 

Secondly, how does one fill the emotional void. I know people suggest things like hobbies or gyming etc but how do these things actually fill the emotional void? I feel at best they distract you from the fact that the void exists but even the distraction is only temporary. Hence it is a very unsustainable solution.  So ho do I fill the void?

Unlike my peers, instead of settling for a typical IT career, I devoted myself full time into an MLM that I had been involved in since my university days. The MLM, of Middle Eastern origins, is in the business of providing motivational and life coaching to participants. Participants were highly encouraged to give back to the MLM for the benefit of themselves and others. With my fellow directors' efforts, we grew the MLM to be one of the largest in Singapore and the region. The revenue grew to a level that my family and I could afford to move into Sentosa Cove.

However, even though all seems smooth sailing, there are problems unknown to others. Chief of which is my wife, or rather her dream. She loves singing and always harboured the dream to have an album of her own. Our MLM is also exploring using music to spread our motivational and life coaching messages to even more people. Getting her to front this project would be a nice fit. Yet, I feel uncomfortable that in a way, the MLM is sponsoring my wife's personal dream. I am also disturbed when preliminary talks with some music producers involved musical concepts on Chinese alcohol which may not be a good fit for our wholesome motivational and life coaching corporate messaging.

What should I do? Should I choose to fulfil my wife's dream with the MLM's financial backing or to let a neutral third party decide for the greater good of the MLM?

When i ask them to throw things away, they  always say ""what a waste, i can't bear to throw it away"" which is completely irrational because the shit is worthless.

2851,"I’ve seen a lot of people complaining about getting ghosted on dating apps. Most of the time I agree, it sucks. But many a times it’s because some people can be downright creepy. 
I was talking to this one guy a few months back on an app and at first it seemed he was nice and fun to talk to. But then he got quite annoying, if I didn’t reply for maybe 2hrs, he’d go all “helooooo! Anyone thereeeee” and stuff. It went on until I replied him. Now as a busy student, it’s difficult to reply when you’re in class or working. I evaluated that since I couldn’t take this anymore I ghosted him. A week back he hits me up again (we exchanged telegrams) and I again don’t reply thinking he’d get the idea. He still kept talking like “oh you should have yam fritters at swee choon” (side note: swee choon is dope). Still didn’t reply. 
I feel like the lesson for me here’s is to just tell the guy he’s being weird and then ghost

2856,"I matched with this girl (let's call her girl A) in tinder and she asked me if I wanted to meet up. So we eventually met to netflix and chill at her house and I really enjoyed her company. The next day I suggested to meet again because I missed her, this time to stay over at her house. Before that, we went out to get food but then on the ride back, her ex (girl B) called her (girl A) and demanded her to stay over at her house instead. So girl A told me that she cheated on her and doesn't really wanna get back tgt with her, and kept saying she likes me and wants something more with me. In the end she went over to her house and I went back home.
Fast forward, now girl A hangs out with girl B more and doesn't really initiate any texts or meetups with me. She's kind of a bad texter tho. On the other hand I keep asking her whether she can meet me but she's usually not free, sometimes out with her family or girl B. Girl B also keeps using girl A's phone to block my calls, telegram, whatsapp, snapchat etc. The thing is girl A is quite a bit of a player and has lots of hookups but I still like her. I know she likes someone else more than me (not girl B, but girl C) and that a rs with her will be impossible (she can't handle LDR bc she's studying overseas) but still I keep thinking of her everyday and wanting to meet her, even if just as friends.
I'm not sure if i should leave them alone because I don't get why I have to be treated this way by girl B. I still want to be in contact with girl A even though she's nonchalant about whether I exist in her life or not.
And yes I'm a girl too.

But I don't look sick. I have extracurriculars and I have good grades, if only because I have a talent and flair for my major, and I pull myself out of the pit occasionally to study just a little bit. 

But I know I can be so much more. I want to spend my free time reading and learning about my field further, and doing even more academic and extracurricular activities. I've lost almost all my friends (except online friends) because they won't stop going to places without calorie counts, so I can't eat with them anymore.

But I can't get help. I'm only BMI 15.8. I'm not some beautifully anorexic girl on the brink of death. I read an article a while back in ST of a girl who was obese, lost a ton of weight by binging and purging and eating almost nothing when she restricts, overexercising, obsessing every waking moment- and guess what the local nutritionists said? That she was still bmi 16+, so that's not too bad, some young people are naturally that bmi and that's ok, they'll get heavier as they age, and oh does she know she isn't being healthy, she shouldn't just count calories, she should be counting sugar intake, saturated fat intake, focusing on whole grains, whole foods, yada yada. Telling her to become more obsessed, not less.

I'm so angry. I'm angry that I'm not thin enough to get help. I'm angry that the help here sounds like it is stuck in 3 decades ago. I'm angry that the authorities keep telling people to fixate on this and that and this, I fixate on just one thing (calorie count) and I'm in this mess. I'm angry that there are so many NUS students walking around looking thinner than me, because it means I'm a failure. I'm angry that there are NUS students who are fat, because then I remember that the authorities only care about obesity, diabetes, obesity, obesity, obesity, they don't care about anorexia, even when local research papers say the problem is growing.

We made plans but he canceled at the last minute saying he was very tired, which I accepted as he had just returned from a trip. We still kept talking after that and he split with his girlfriend but suddenly, he just cut contact and disappeared.

2878,"I've been seeing all these posts about love life or crushes and wanting to be in a relationships. 

So here's my two cents on this.

If you ever ever want to be in a Relationship because you either wanna feel ""complete"" or ""have someone by yourside"" or feel loved everyday, my advice to you is, don't. 

Relationships were never meant to fill gaps in your heart and erase your solidarity in life. It's up to you to do this on your own for god's sake, don't expect someone to love you when you yourself, don't even love who you are. 

Love yourself first. Then improve on your own qualities not for that ""special someone"", but for yourself first. There's always this chinese saying ""愛人入己"" (Love others like how you love yourself) for a reason.

If you ever want to be in a relationship because ""Waaaah drama so sweet worr the guy and girl so cute together keep doing cute thingies together siaa, I wish I can be like them!!!!!"", don't.

Life isn't like your Taiwan or Korean or Chinese or ""The fault in our stars"" or ""Twilight"". They paint you rosy pictures of how relationships are. Don't you ever wonder why are the guy and girl leads always so free? They can do all these cutsy stuff together so often, gazing deeply into each of their eyes, smudging icecream on their noses, promising to love each other forever?

That's because dramas...they don't really show how busy a person's life can be and yeah, they don't show the responsibilities. (I'm referring to work or studying religiously for the exams)

No one have all the time in the world to be with one another 24/7 and do cute surprises every now and then, excluding the once in a bluemoon surprises for celebrations or popping by for surprises.

When you and your partner are busy working/studying, there's not much time for all these cutsy stuff or lovey-dovey outings almost everyday or multiple times a week. There isn't. 

Sure there can be surprises but don't ever expect love lifes to be as fulfilling as K-Dramas when you two reach adulthood.

Bottom line is, Love yourself first before loving someone or else you're going to depend on your partner for your own happiness, which shouldn't be the case. You're suppose enrich your partner's life, and they will too, not leeching onto each other's life to fill in a gap inside you.
And ohh. Keep love life realistically. Everyone have their own life going on, and your partner isn't orbiting around you 24/7.

OK maybe some backstory will be helpful,

so we have been in the same class for 2 years already but we have never talked to one another. He always looks so serious and detached. He never socialize outside of his cliche of 5, he ain't the handsome popular type and he has no CCA everyday go school and disappears, basically 宅男. 

This semester I was late for class on the first day and cos the module needs 6 per project group and his cliche of 5 is missing 1 and my cliche of 7 abandon me :(... in the end I was put tgt with them. 

Wah at first I was like SMLJ, but wah.... 

First of all, I think this module I finally can get my first A in Uni his whole cliche average CGPA 4.8 sia OMG carry me Oppas. 

Secondly I learn he was a PS in their company in NS and his cliche is all his battalion mates. His cliche machiam got hierarchy somemore with him on top. Wah when they are working is really military efficiency: everyone is so reliable and on time, after all meetings got minutes post on WhatsApp chat, meetings never derail, and rarely ever have meetings cos most of the time instructions are passed down on WhatsApp. Wah I in this group, I feel like the module like easy only while my own cliche is struggling.

When he is leading meetings and WhatsApp chats wah the decisiveness, the charisma, the ideas, and how the group respect him.... Wah I almost 动心了. 

Then one day the group decide to go his house for meeting after school cos he stay near NUS. Then I really witness the 宅, wah his room is shelves of manga, bed full of soft toys, gaming setup, really is 宅. But go his house liao I really don't know why I really 动心了. When we reach his house he went to bathe and when he wear his home attire of anime singlet and baggy sweater pants, I observed hard till almost xray shoot out of my eyes and..... dayum gurl how can it be a 宅男 be so lean and fit. 

After awhile I think I managed to mingle into their inner circle and they started to treat me more openly and over time i realise dayum this bugger is really..... Errrr..... Contrasting. Like when he is working, total concentration no bullshit talk, no distractions, charismatic, in summary 帅 but when he isn't working he is like the chillest of chill, jokes, the sick burns and memes. This contrast really turns me on.

So i started asking around, his friends told me they have been suaning him since NS to get attached but he says he wanna stay single. Says his reason is he barely can even take care of himself how to take care of GF and he wanna be free, indepedent, answer to no one. Then I'm like but he take care of you guys leh and you guys burden him also leh?..... Then they told me that they think it was a problem with his EQ not his IQ.... Which I kinda get it. He really is those slow warmer type, those kind which you hate at the start cos they are so direct and insensitive at the start but as they get to know you better, he get more and more sensitive kinda guys. It doesn't help that he doesn't try at all to socialize and make friends as well.

So i started to hint hint very mildly, but he wah really is hopeless. But I really want him. How? The only thing I can think of is I pose the qns first. But I don't wanna leh cos I dun think he will like it. How? Ladies and guys help me plox.

P.S. to my cliche, ladies u are great friends but bad students haha next group project I think I gonna abandon u gurls liao sry. :) I found myself some academic sugar daddies hahaha.

A few years ago, I met this girl from an anime event and we added each other as friends on Fb. 1 weeks later she messaged me and we chatted for a while. she told me she was 30 and engaged. I was surprised as she seemed young (I was only 21). She asked me out but I rejected. She was really sad and regretted telling me about herself. She then sent me dozens of messages trying to convince me. 

I felt bad and decided to meet her thinking there’s no harm. we met at the MRT at night and She brought me to the karaoke and ordered a lot of alcohol to my surprise. We both got high and kissed. Then we went back home. I thought to myself that nope I’m never meeting her ever again. 

1 week later she messaged me saying she wanted to meet but I had exams so I said no. she said she wanted to come to my house. I said no but somehow she managed to convince me again. So she came to my house. I studied while she did her own stuff. But she started to touch and seduce me and we ended up having sex. she knew the way to my house already and would come every weekend and we did it every time. I was ok with it since it’s like free one just take lor. 

Until a point I thought this can’t continue anymore so I blocked her and chased her off when she came over. However my parents already knew about her and scolded me for chasing her off. I told my parents everything about her but they sided with her. eventually she went to seduce my Father, making my mom angry and wanting to chase her off. I wanted to call the police for harassment but my Father wouldn’t allow it. Things became ugly but eventually everything was settled when I told her not to harass our family anymore or I would call the police. 

I felt like I was sexually harassed and my privacy was violated but most people wouldn’t think so because most think that only happens to girls right? It still leaves a scar on me and I regretted ever meeting such a person.

Back in secondary 1, my classmates were into making class t-shirts for everyone. At the back of our t-shirts, each of us could decide on what number we wanted to be printed on it to reflect what represented us the best. Normally, people would decide on choosing their class registration number i.e. 1 to 40.

But for me, I just thought of having the number '69' at the back of my class t-shirt. Back then, I found the number to be so elegant. It was like Ying and Yang merged together. My classmates questioned me why I choosed this number. I was just confused as to why I could not and they did not told me the reason either.

Wanted to really keep her beside me but only if she sees me as her Boyfriend of course. I definitely will be very good to her even I am not rich at the moment .

It was her also drives me to think so much more on family and marriage. That is why no matter what, I have to push myself now. I definitely going to miss her and probably, that’s only girl I ever cares and love too.

Funny isn’t it? I think it is just fated to let me know her. Sometimes, there are things... just happened for a reason and yeah. I know what I must do now.

2904,"Back in my poly days, I fell in love with a guy. He was handsome and charming, while I was ugly and fat. I knew that I had no chance with him, so I just watched from afar with loving eyes while he hung out with all the pretty, popular girls. 

A woman's determination is a powerful thing. While the love of my life trained in NS, I did some ""training"" of my own: With a combination of exercise, dieting and slimming pills, I was able to slim down to a size 4, which is still fat by asian standards but a far cry from the baby hippo that I was in poly. More importantly, slimming down gave me a huge confidence boost and made me feel like anything was possible.

When the love of my life finished NS and entered NUS, I quickly found a mutual friend to introduce us.  That day, for the first time in my life, the love of my life actually gazed at me for more than 3 seconds. I could sense the hunger in his eyes.  I felt loved, wanted, desired. I felt like a woman.

The next few months were the happiest time of my life. We held hands together everywhere we went, as if our very fingertips were welded together by the burning fires of love. When we ate together, we would feed each other and every other bite would end with a kiss, not necessarily on the mouth. When we took the shuttle bus together, we would hug each other tightly and let the gently swaying motions of the bus bring us to paradise. The night I gave him my virginity, I remember how he ripped off my clothes like an animal and started kissing every inch of my body. Slowly but surely, my facebook feed became filled with the happy, laughing pictures of us together. It was as if the old fat and ugly me had never existed. 

Sadly, every happy moment has to come to an end. Several months into the relationship, I began to gain weight again. In response, I increased my intake of slimming pills, but the pills were ineffective. I was also starting to feel unwell: I was feeling drowsy and sleepy all the time, I vomited frequently, I felt frequent pains in my abdomen area, and I missed my period. At first, I thought I might be getting pregnant, but when I started bleeding heavily, I began to sense that something might be horribly wrong. Before long, it became clear what the problem was: I had indeed gotten pregnant but the slimming pills caused a miscarriage, as well as lasting harm to my body. I cried and cried that day in the doctor's office. My parents threw away the rest of my slimming pills. 

Today, I am back to my original poly weight. The love of my life left me. All that is left of the relationship are the medical bills and the frequent visits to various doctors. Apparently, the damage caused by the slimming pills was quite severe and even the specialists assigned to my case are unsure if I will ever fully recover. I am also warned by the doctors that getting pregnant in the near future may lead to complications.  

Given my present weight and the health issues mentioned above, it is unlikely that I will ever find another guy again, so the story of my love life probably ends here.  Yesterday afternoon, as I was taking the shuttle bus back home from UHC, I started thinking about my ex again. I had given him everything that is possible for a woman to give a man. Logically speaking, I should hate him. Yet somehow, I felt no hate at all, only love. After all, he was the love of my life. I would have gladly given up my entire life just to spend another minute with him. I only wish that my stupid fat body could have stayed slim just a little longer so that our time together didn't have to end so quickly. As things stand, our story was short but sweet, the most beautiful thing I have ever known, the most beautiful thing I will ever know. I am happy.

2905,"Hello :) I need some advice regarding studies in the future :/

I graduated from a Polytechnic this year, and I don't plan on continuing my studies/work on the industry that I graduated with the diploma from.

I want to go to uni (I was thinking it would be good to go since I want to change tracks), but I honestly don't know what I want to study. Since I would have to have really good grades and a relevant diploma to enter a course in a local uni, I doubt I can do so. I have been advised to take a foundation course overseas, but I feel like it's not really worth it, since foundation courses are meant to be a pathway to a certain course, and you can't change your mind after. (I've also tried to apply to some unis this year and I got rejected by all)

I was thinking of taking private A Levels, however I've been advised against it since it's very expensive, and I haven't been exposed to the GCE kind of syllabus for a long time so it'll be harder for me to transition and absorb info. I was also told that if I don't do well it will be detrimental to my records instead, since latest tests are taken into consideration first. I was also thinking about taking the SATs but it's useless in Singapore.

What should I do? Should I just enter a private uni to get a degree? Or should I discover at least what I want to study first? Or what other actions should I take?

Thank you for taking your time to read this, I really appreciate it a lot :)

To clarify things .
1. We are both hitting 20 so definitely not waiting for PSLE or OLVLS to begin .
2. His mum has always been tracking his location and his younger brother’s location.
3. To : Shlomoh Jedediah , I don’t think I’m very much of a manipulator , bully or control freak . I’m just very direct with my words and I do apologise for my wrong choice of words after arguments . I’m usually very passive but his parents gives me stressEs which are unexplainable (perhaps I’m just picturing a future with him too often hence parents became a problem)  as I do not know whether what they say is true ( the mum told her son that I’m not bad and said really nice stuff about but somehow the dad just contradicts ) perhaps i have left some parts of the story that made you misinterpret things . I’m pretty appreciative of him as well , it’s just he loves me more than I love him . 
4. I voiced out that he need to work on being more independent and more assertive , he just say my parents won’t care and won’t listen to me .
5. He’s done some grave mistakes in the past( before he was tgt with me) and that led his parents to not trust him as much . but when he was with me , he became much better as a whole in general ( not to add values to myself ) he’s more studious and we planned for a long term r/s ( that’s why I am reluctant to break off )
6. I wanted to break off because I was brought up differently from him and hence I will never understand how he was treated by his parents ( good / bad ) i dont know . And also I felt used ( as mentioned in previous confession ) his dad used his weakness (which is me ) to cut his allowance so he can’t go dates with me . Thing is we hardly go on dates , he usually sends me home after classes and then head back home . So i dont know what’s the big deal . Like i was thinking because my boyf refused to go church as he wanted more time to study ( that’s why he threatens him a lot . His dad is less understanding that his mum and is a strong believer of Christianity  ) ( or perhaps I’m not a Christian hence he doesn’t wants me to date his son , i dont know) so with all these stresses , I do not want his parents to use me against him to get what they want . I felt bad so I wanted to stop this by breaking off . 
7. To Aline Ang , I am not threatening that I will break up with him . I just mentioned , I can’t cope w the stresses as mentioned above . Sorry if my story wasn’t clear and misinterpreted . 
8. (Imagine all this in mandarin) After she drove down to find him specifically , she said “ I didn’t want him to date during finals . I didn’t know y’all would last so long , so I didn’t regard u as family but if y’all proved to me that you guys are serious then I would have treated you differently(like a family) . But I really find that you’re a really nice girl and independent and : can’t translate anymore bc my mandarin sucks : . So I felt weirded out and I asked “ why didn’t u tell us when we started dating “ she just replied smiling “ I didn’t know y’all were gonna last lols”.  She also mentioned “ his dad always use u to threaten him bc it works and has effect “ 
9. I still love him , I really do and we’ve talked so much about the future bc we knew we were meant to be but things will differently crop up . 
10. I was stressed bc I’m afraid when he goes to uni , the same old shit gonna get up bc his mum doesn’t really socialise much so basically her kids revolves around her ... I don’t agree with authoritarian parenting style ... I was brought up with my parents as my bestest friends . 
11. My grammar or rather English isn’t perfect , please excuse my mistakes . 
12. To Jael Ng , your advice is perfect . Thank you so much ! I shall heed your advice 
13.  So all in all , his parents doesn’t really have anything against me but I feel that they have motives bc their words and actions don’t match at all and the way they treat my boyfriend as if he still a kid . Which I’m sure , he is an young adult already . Because of I couldn’t comprehend why his parents did what they did , and also because I was brought up differently .

Was in the same position last year. I thought we were stable, independent, not too clingy and still loving when we met over the weekends. Towards the last year he outwardly told me he didnt like my family, but wanted me to take care of his mum as he was not able to. I kept going over to his place as he was tired. but during my working training phase, I was just as tired as he was in army. In fact I was always accomodating towards him during his army days. But my efforts didnt seem to work out. 

He initiated a break earlier on but regretted almost instantly. Yet he made no efforts to change for the next half a year and made excuses like ""Im like this, I cant change"". After I gave the ultimatium, he admited that he fell for another girl at his internship. He confessed to her, just so he can hear her rejection and then focus his attention on me. Which he realised he was being a jerk and thus agreed to end the relationship. 

Im happily attached now to some one who cares and appreciates me. Dont be in a relationship where you are the only one putting in effort. Youre tired, time to leave.

2913,"So I have been dating my boyfriend for a few years now and I have accepted that the ""honeymoon phase"" is long gone. Each week we only meet up once (except during exam periods) and we mostly contact through texts any other day. However, since he started uni (I am two years ahead due to his NS), most of the weekdays when I message him to chat at night since we didn't talk much through the day I would always be thrown the words ""I am busy"" or ""I have work to do"". It is understandable right? I do have work or tests myself too so I can understand. However, it feels worse when I try to ask only for 5 minutes to talk or when he gives me a time limit to talk to him. Sometimes he gives me alternative options of another night to talk to him but he will end up telling me ""I have xxx test or work tomorrow"" on the alternative night itself before I even started any conversation. Recently, I was really upset over something in school so I confided in him and told him that I'm really sad and would wanna talk to him. And his reply? ""I'm doing work sorry can't reply"" Most of the weekends I'll head over to his side because he doesn't really want to go out and I try to make mini surprises for him to keep the relationship going and be more meaningful. But it really feels very one-sided most of the time. I have talked to him about it too and at first he apologises but afterwards would claim that I'm PMS-ing. I am really lost, what should I do?

Yes you can say she is naive or even childish, but there is no good reason for the commenters to lash out at her like that and put her down. She is just an idealistic naive girl. To be honest, it’s way better to date such a girl than to date someone who doesn’t know the value of devotion and commitment.

I already came so far from a poor family who can't afford uni even though my result was good. I went out to work and save for university myself so I wouldn't burden my parents. She knows all these and she still left me for a fresh university graduate. :(

Also single and available. any part timers who found love in NUS? ????

I totally didn't expect the amount of hate I got from my confession. Maybe because I haven't added more details. But here goes. When I started talking to him, I made it a point to ignore every message any guy sends me. Even my male friends that I know irl. Of course, this is with the exception of schoolwork related topics. If I put in this amount of effort to stay committed, don't I have the right to expect the same from him? Anyway I'm glad that I tested him, since I doubt he'll be loyal anyway.

2924,"I in love with this friend of mine. Let’s name her Carol. Carol is a sweet and nice girl. We are not a couple as she has a bf. I am writing this as a friend, rival in love and an IRCAU. To me, her bf isn’t a good bf at all. Every time she meets her bf, she needs to travel about 45 – 1 hrs to his bf house and just stay at home the whole day doing nothing. Her bf disappoints her every damn time. Whenever she is excited about a date, he will either cancels or end up didn’t mentioned it at all. (he does it all the time) The worst part about his bf is he doesn’t seem like he cares about carol. For e.g. when Carol is having stress or having a problem, the bf won’t even drop her a text message asking her how she feels. The reason given is, he doesn’t want to add more stress to her. (Does this really help?) Oh, can you imagine, a bf that doesn’t fetch and sent her gf back home her. The worst part is one time he even tries to convince carol to choose side against her own parent when the things is not going according to his plan. I cannot accept this. We should never choose a side against our parent. Carol is very close to her parent. He should know this will hurt carol feeling right? (Asshole) And the bf didn’t even make an effort to get close with her the parent.  I feel he is just using her to get what he wanted. This is not love, this is selfishness. He bf got this ego issue. Whenever he is unhappy with something, he will just ignore carol. Carol will ask him what wrong, but he will just act like a weirdo and ignore her. After he is fine, he will just pretend nothing happened. I really think feel he should grow up and stop acting like a weirdo. If he continues to be like this, I hope he can leave and go find someone else.

2925,"I’m responding to the post regarding the CMB premium trial guy who is baffled by why girls don’t reply him. I have been using CMB for a while amongst other dating apps and I will try my best to shed some light on your question. Do keep in mind that I’m not representing all members of my gender, but just mainly from my own experiences. Some background here would be that I’m a NUS grad, decent - looking (no need to off the light/close eyes during sex la hor, so I think can classify as ok-looking la) and I work in sales so I do earn a decent amount each month to pay for my own expenses.

Firstly, I do initiate conversations here and there if I can come up with things to say from the person’s profile or ice breakers (for CMB), so you might want to review your own profile to see if you have included sufficient conversation starters in the description. Maybe try to come up with something more unique or interesting for your ice breakers (for CMB) especially since most guys leave this part empty. Next, try not to open the conversation with “how’s your day/weekend/Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday/Friday?” because honestly it’s hard to reply to such questions. It’s too open-ended and it’s a very thin line between sharing too much and sharing too little to keep the conversation going. It takes a conversation-pro to navigate such questions. You might want to consider starting with pick-up lines (a number of my female friends do appreciate such humor, myself included) or just start the conversation with something from their description on how they like their date to be, etc. Another tip is to always end with a question (that is easy to answer but not yes/no questions) to keep the conversation going. 
One more thing is to see if you are always swiping right on the incompatible kind of girls in which you guys have nothing in common to talk about, like those super pretty girls whom you like to look at but is not suitable for you in the long run because y’all are too different. This part would require some self-reflection on your end on your own personality and what type of girls would suit you. The key is to find the that unique balance between what type of girls you can accept versus the type of girls suitable for you. You should start getting more matches with girls whom you can vibe with and that’s when the conversation can start flowing.

Secondly, the speed of replies does matter. You stated that you only reply after work and not during (maybe you can consider replying during your lunch breaks or short toilet breaks), hence I think it would also take one day on average for you to reply your match? I might be wrong about the timeline cause math is not my strong suit but speedy replies from your end does prompt a similar reciprocation on their end if they are sincere. I did find an increase in the speed of replies after I took an effort to reply within 2-3 hours max (quite reasonable right? Just take a toilet break from work every 3 hours). 

Lastly, it’s important to actually get around to asking the person to meet up in real life. To be honest, most Singaporean guys have no game (sorry guys) when it comes to actually asking the girl out. You need to be on the look out for so-called ‘opportunities’ to bring the online conversation to a real life conversation. Some guys whom I matched with let the online conversation go on for too long until it was too difficult to keep up with the daily texting or the conversation topics have gone stale. A safe timeline for reference is to initiate meeting up during the first week of texting / matching at the earliest possible date. Text for maybe 1-2 days first before initiating a meet up so that it’s not too weird. 

Ultimately, it takes two hands to clap and if you have already tried all ways / taken into account all of the tips from the above and yet the girl is still not replying, I think you can just take it as she is not looking for anything serious from a dating app. You can bring the water to the cow but you can’t force it to drink. What you can do is only to control your own actions and mindset on the situation to up your texting game a little bit. Also, maybe don’t take this whole dating app thing so seriously as well, this is probably the key advice I can give you. Just match, chat and see how things go. If they develop to a romantic relationship that’s the best, if not don’t take it too hard. Keep swiping and chatting, you will get better at it. Good luck! :)

2929,"I actually graduated 5 years ago, but just wanted to share my story with you guys--especially those of you who can't decide whether to chase your dreams, or get a normal job.

I started playing poker in my 3rd year of Uni, and fell in love with the game immediately. I've always loved figuring things out, and poker was like a super complicated puzzle that I would constantly be thinking of and figuring out one portion at a time. By the time I graduated I'd made quite a bit of money, so it was really a no-brainer to keep going. Eventually I managed to pay off my study loan through poker alone, and today I derive a stable income from both playing and coaching.

""If you're passionate enough about something, you'll always find a way to make it work."" That's a lie, period. This world doesn't function in terms of absolutes. It's one of the lessons that poker teaches you. There's no 100% in poker (except in very rare cases where you flop a straight flush or something), and neither is there 100% in life. What good players do is make calculated decisions to improve their odds. They get it in as an 80/20 favourite, instead of a 40/60 underdog. And that's what passion and hard work can do for you.

So I guess what I'm saying is, if you're passionate enough about something, you won't always be able to make it work. But you can sure as hell improve your chances of doing so ;)

I shared his pics with my best friend and coincidentally, she told me that they just matched on 2 days ago. That meant that he was still using cmb after he knew me.

To test if the guy is serious about me, I asked her to message that guy, hoping that he wouldn't reply. To my horror, he not only replied her, but used the same pickup lines on her that he used on me. I then asked my friend to ask him out as the final test. He immediately agreed to a movie date. I then asked her to block him which she did.

I'm heartbroken. How can he flirt with me for 2 weeks, then accept a date from another girl? Worst thing is, that's my friend. I know I should feel this way, but I feel very jealous. 

He was willing to go out on a date with my friend on the day that they started talking. How easy is that? I feel so betrayed by the guy. Should I block him too, or ask him out and not show up to waste his time?

I’ve been in a r/s w my boyfriend for coming 11 months and during this period , we had lots of arguments and stupid fights . Mostly me being petty . 
1. Recently , we got into a fight and since his mum forced him to download a location tracking device , he couldn’t meet me as often . So his daily routine consists of school , tuition and home . About the recent argument , he cabbed down from his school and wanted to talk to me as I suggested a break up . I refused to see him just because I couldn’t bear to see him cry and leave him . His mum tracked his location and she drove all the way down to my house and went searching for us at every level but she went to the wrong block lols . 
2. Anyways just a side story , his parents ( not sure if both parents are involved or one but ) used me to threaten him by cutting his allowance if he keeps on hanging out with me instead of studying . Thing is , he has been studying so much and sometimes we Skype study from 9/10pm to 3am . So am I wrong to Skype study with him despite not taking the same course ? 
3. So there was this time his dad came out to fetch a cup of water and saw him at the table Skype studying with me at 2/3am and he slammed the iPad and claimed that he wasn’t studying and that he wasn’t taking care of his health as it was already 2/3am . So he talked and talked and suddenly mentioned “ that’s why I wanted you to go church every Sunday so u can have better characters “ . I’ve been pondering over this sentence and it just doesn’t make sense to me . Does that mean if everyone go church , everyone is a good person and have good characters and if you don’t go , you are a bad person and bad characters ? 
4. My boyfriend often complain that he doesn’t have a proper study area yet he doesn’t wanna talk to his parents about it , he’s quite a passive character and maybe a mummy’s boy . 
5. Recently after the argument , we agreed not to talk for 3months until his exams ends in late November . During this period , we are to think about our compatibility and stuff . 
6. When I was arguing with him , the choice of words I used were pretty damn harsh and made comments on his parents about their  method of coping of their him . For the tracking device and some other things . I know I am in a wrong . But I don’t if I should continue this r/s with him...
7. I really appreciate him so much as he’s done so much for me and I know I can never find someone like him ever . He’s just one of a kind ... so I’m reluctant to let go ... however this 3months is gonna make us drift so much so that we might still break up after that ...

2941,"I (M) started using CMB recently, and have been getting a healthy number of matches. For context, I’m average looking with an average build, have a decent professional job, and am looking for something serious. 

However, I’ve had a daunting and tiring experience. 

Most of my matches “liked” my profile but either kept completely quiet, or took ages to reply (e.g. 1 day). Several matches, though highly educated (e.g. some graduated with a FCH), do not bother responding to my questions, and respond with replies that display zero sincerity. Now while I do appreciate that we all have a life outside of dating apps, I still take the effort to reply my matches as often as I can - my work typically ends around 8-11pm or later, and I do not use CMB while at work.

Recently, I was offered a free CMB premium trial, and am now able to view the stats of all of my matches. This has led me to some interesting observations:

(1) Many girls reply to only around 20-30% of their chats.

(2) The better-looking matches tend to be more reluctant to start chats, and also tend to reply less to chats.

(3) Numerous girls tend to reply after at least 10-12 hours. These girls are also typically those who reply to fewer chats.

To all the LADIES out there, out of curiosity, why do girls return “likes” but keep completely silent / display a complete lack of interest thereafter? I find this very baffling because if you aren’t interested at all, then why “like” my profile in the first place?

For avoidance of doubt, I did not notice any fake profiles.

I find it rather sad at how all the passionate clinical pharmacists commenters are all busy monologuing about how clinical practice is a calling and that anyone who disagree is either ungrateful, unenlightened or both. In other words, they kindly request that all unhappy souls change to a different field of practice. While that is an extremely good piece of advice to heed, it is highly likely that clinical pharmacists will remain underpaid/overworked/not well respected because of these people. Instead of addressing valid points raised by people who have opposing views on the profession (such as those by the commenter, Han Qi En on the same post 68787) , they prefer to live in an echo chamber and adopt a holier than thou attitude.

Rapunzel lets her hair down for her prince. She lets her prince climb her and enter into her secret place. Her prince is madly in love with her and promises to return with gold and jewels and a kingdom. Her prince promises to free her from her stone prison. When time is up, Rapunzel lets her prince down gently. The prince never noticed the heap of used condoms by the window.

Thunbelina is attached to a blind mole who knows nothing about anything. She escapes in time. Flying off for freedom on the back of a swallow, she finally meets her prince. Sadly, by now she is past 40. She is not in time. 

These are the confessions of love. These the stories we read to our children before bedtime. These are the promises we make to each other. 

I think all of these stories are beautiful.

2961,"I live in one of the residential colleges in UTown and I recently came across something disturbing. I was on the 8th floor and wanted to do my laundry. When the previous wash was done, I removed the clothes and transferred them to the dryer. However what I saw shocked me as I saw two female swimsuits and several panties together with a bunch of male clothes, underwear included. The clothes were obviously guy clothes, but the female stuff were quite disturbing and it worries me that there might be perverted guys living on the same floor as me; my undergarment might even get stolen and it’s really sickening to think about that.

2964,"How important is filial piety to you guys? I really just want to leave my parents behind but I can’t get over how children are ‘supposed’ to take care of their parents. I feel obliged to remain by my parents’ side even though I’ve been nothing more than a punching bag to them all my life.

I am not joking when I say my parents literally make me want to die. I am a different person when I am in hall and at home. In hall, I feel relaxed and happy most of the time. But home? Home is different. I hate going home. There is no warmth and I feel so depressed around my parents all the time.

My parents do not love me and I’ve come to accept that. They dote on my older brother a lot, but show me no affection. My brother is 22 and he has not worked for even a single second in his life. All he does is stay at home and play computer games my parents give him a monthly allowance. He has no plans for uni and just wants to live off my parents. I am the complete opposite. My parents told me to get a job as soon as I turned 16 and stopped all financial support then. After A levels and before uni started, I held two jobs, one full time and one part-time and worked 7 days a week, just so I could afford to pay for uni.

That is not all. My father is very violent. One time when he drank a little too much, he strangled me so hard that my neck was bruised after that. Another time, he bashed my head into the wall with so much force that I had a mild concussion. And no, in case you guys think I did something to anger him, I did not. I am so afraid of my father that I just hide in my room all day. I’ve withstood violent episodes like this on a weekly basis for as long as I can remember and I am so tired.

My mother, on the other hand, has never been kind with to me her words. She reminds me multiple times a day that I am not wanted in the family. At one point, she even went as far to say that she regretted giving birth to me. Thinking back, my mother has never really been a ‘mother’ to me. Growing up, I was always hungry. They always left me at home alone without food when they worked while my brother went to a childcare where he was well-fed. They never attended my parent-teacher meetings in primary school, never went to any of my graduation(s)... and were just absent all the time.

The only reason why they keep me around is because I have a lot of savings. After they withdrew their financial support from me, I learnt how to use my money frugally and saved quite a lot. They only turn to me when they need money and they’ve never returned any of that money to me.   

My family stresses me so much that I attempted to commit suicide when I was younger because I couldn’t stand being around them anymore. Do you know what it feels like to wake up everyday knowing that you’re not wanted? I’m already 20 but even now, I still contemplate suicide from time to time. I don’t want to be here if it means that I have to take care of my abusers for the rest of my life. Yet, I can’t walk away because of that darn notion of filial piety. I’m at a lost.... but then again, who knows? My father might just kill me someday when he’s drunk (again) before I actually kill myself. 

Life’s a joke. I have the resources to just walk away and leave my family behind, but I don’t have the power to do it. I am a prisoner to my family.

2965,"I'm really tired. Both physically and mentally
I've had enough of so called friends, in all my life. Theres only been a few people that I really trusted enough to share things with. And I was always the odd one out or the extra in any group or events. Recently I lost one of the greatest friend anyone could have cause of some differences. And that leave me alone, with no one to turn to , with no one to talk to. Even when I want to talk to someone, it just seems as tho they are not interested. And it is really tiring. When all this emotional stress adds up, its been really burning me out badly. 
Everyday I ask myself, why cant I have some friends whom I can talk to , to share things with , or even go out with. Why? Why?
Everyday everyone is making plans with their friends , but here i am. Without anyone to talk to at all.
Some claims that we can be good friend, but when we started talking. It clearly shows that they are not interested..
The pain is so draining that whenever i think about my life, my heart really hurts. It hurts as bad as tho someone is stabbing my heart. 
Everyday Im drawn closer and closer to numbing the pain once and for all.
I've tried looking for a past friend to talk to, but my friend has already moved on to others. ANd im still left all alone
So to everyone out there that has a friend who come looking for u for help or to talk, do spend some time talking to him/her because once they reach where i am.. it is really depressing and almost with no return, you may just save someone life by talking to them for a short while

2966,"Hey everyone! I'm a year 2 NUS student needing to let something off my chest. I know this may not be a very big issue but i feel as if i'm at a crossroad of my university life. 

I currently have a small group of friends (who we have known one another other for a year) who i hang out with in school. They are generally okay but they kinda love to make fun of me (sometimes with low key insults) whenever we go for canteen breaks in between lectures. I don't really like it but I'm not sure if i'm too sensitive as well. Sometimes the people around me throw casual insults which leaves me feeling kinda bad after so i'm not entirely sure if its something i have to change in the first place. Ultimately, this group of friends are people that i interact with because of school work and I can say with an upmost assurance that they would highly likely be out of my life after graduation. 

I'm not sure if I will be viewed as the crook here but I feel like i can do better by finding myself 'better' friends, or possibly some other friends who i can 'click' better with. I know its a little too soon but i have recently joined a cca in hopes of a more supportive circle of friends. 

I hope that this doesn't make me sound like a depressed person because i feel fine, just a little sad that i have not found my group of friends who i feel really close to yet. I also hope that this wouldn't come across as a pity post.Instead I would be really grateful to listen to any advice to make my university life a more memorable one. Thanks! :)

2967,"Hi, this is a story about me and a girl I really care about. We know each other for a couple of years. We hang out a lot. I really enjoyed my time whenever I with her. Slowly, I start developing feeling toward her. I do a lot of silly things for her. From care to love. I always thought I am cool about this, but things aren’t as easy as I think. She has a bf. In the beginning, I can feel how much she loves her bf. But now I feel unhappiness and disappointment from her relationship. Seriously, I wasn’t quite happy about how her bf treated her. Cos I always think if you are in a committed relationship, you must always care about another half. I wasn’t expecting much from her until recently I really couldn’t take it anymore. I think she deserves someone better; someone really treats her well and take care of her. 
When the feeling gets stronger, I became demanding. I want her to care about me as I do. In the end, we quarreled. I still remember that is one time we have this huge quarrel and I told her I don’t want to be her friend anymore. (what a wrong move). We used words to hurt each other like a weapon. And we stop texting and hangout for the next 2 days. During the cool-down period is really a hell for me. I couldn’t sleep in the night. All I think about is how is she doing today? Did she have any gastric pain from skipping dinner again? And many more. After 2 days of hell, I finally pick up my phone and sent her a text message asking her how she been doing the last 2 days. She replied was cold. After exchanging a few messages, she said she wants to stop all this drama as she couldn’t handle it anymore. I so afraid of losing her I keep repeating asking her is it her final decision. At that moment I realized I am losing her forever as a friend. I panicked but I handle it well. I told her I respect her decision as long as she is happy. And she told me she will be happy this way. 
On and off I will text her asking her personal life. Her replied is so short and cold. We stopped texting, and whenever I am alone, I will think of what I told her before. This is what I told her before if one day we ever drift apart, and for any reason, you can’t reach me by text, you can just pop by my house and tell me you are fine”. This is all I wanted to know from her. 
After I few days of waiting, she finally texted me. I was so shocked and happy at the same time. She asked me how I am, and my first reply to her is I miss her so much! And she replied she misses me too. That moment is unforgettable. 
Right now, although we remain as friend and hangout. But I keep my feeling toward her. I don’t want to give her any more pressure and I just want her to be happy. Sometime when I see her unhappy or sad about certain things, I will try my best to bring a smile back to her. Looking into her eye and tell her how gorgeous and beautiful she is. This way will make me happy too. And, I will bring her favorite foods, drink, and snacks whenever I can. I not trying to replace her bf or anyone else, I will just be honest to myself. Cos I really think she deserves all this treatment and also someone really appreciates her. 
I couldn’t sleep this few nights. Many things are going through my head. Time is running out for me; all I can do now is to treat her the best I could and make her happy every time we meet.
And I really hope one day I can be…

2971,"I was in NUS but have lived abroad for the most of it - we own a larger house in Australia (just to set the context, not really important here). My parents are divorced and I have been living with my mom since they were separated. I was 10. Now I'm in my late 20s and my mom is in her 50s. My dad is rich so I can say I have been living a very comfortable life. So does my mom. She dates a lot of different men and I think it has influenced the way I view dating. Years ago I overheard her and her then boyfriend in the room on the 3rd floor of our house. Of course, it was not so pleasant. He was screaming Mommy and I could hear it clearly. That was traumatising for a teenage girl but opened my eyes to hookups and kinky sex. I didn’t see his face but I recognised his voice through recent publications about an abusive incident which was recorded on CCTV. I knew immediately it was him.

So years down the road, I am new to Tinder and have been swiping for the past 3 months. I matched this man who works in the regulatory industry and he seems very smart and charismatic during our dates. The moment I met him, I felt like he was so familiar. His face, his hair and his voice. I am always fascinated by men with thick and healthy hair. His hair was exceptionally bushy and it was jet black. Honestly, it was like love at first sight.

Ytd night was our 4th date and I decided it was about time we had sex. He came to my house when my mom was on a date with her new boyfriend. And yes, it was timed so they wouldn’t meet. I was pretty nervous.

The sex was hot and steamy and I had my night lights on. We started kissing passionately and removed our clothes. I was kissing him and started fondling his hair. The sex started getting even more passionate and we were at our climax. I started pulling onto his hair even more and suddenly, it all came off. It’s a wig. Then he pulled out and screamed Mommy. I don’t know what is worse. His wig, him screaming Mommy or my realisation that he’s familiar because I’ve seen him on the news. What should I do?

2977,"Hi, I just graduated and am considering between whole life insurance (with endowment) VS term plan (until age 75). The pros of life insurance (with endowment) from what I know is:
- pay a sum until a certain age then enjoy coverage for the rest of life
- can withdraw money in rainy days 

Cons:
- much much much more ex than term plan
- lower pay out than term

Pros of term:
- very affordable (think $100+ per month vs $300-$500 for whole life plan)
- very high coverage 

Con of term:
- terminates when you stop paying
- only covers 70 (for most)

Thus the game plan is usually to buy term + invest heavily for years after 70.

Since most ppl have been buying whole life, I've only recently heard about term from my insurer. But my insurer has been aggressively recommending me term. 

What are your thoughts?

2990,"Hi.

To put things shortly, I have been dating my partner for a little over half a year now. Yes, I know that to most of the relationship gurus out there, this may be an incredibly short amount of time. I'd ideally like to say that in this short amount of time, I have gotten to learn a lot more than about my partner, about relationships (this is not my first), and most importantly about myself than most tend to do. I recently (a couple of months now) have been having doubts about this relationship. I feel that sure, my partner and I have been decently happy and supportive of each other yet at the same time, I feel that this person is not the one. It's not a problem with my partner or anything like that, I just feel that we are not exactly the optimal pair.

The replies I get can usually be split into two categories; ""no couple is an optimal pair"" or ""don't give up too soon"". To the former, my idea is that sure we aren't optimal but it isn't difficult to find someone who would be a much better match for the other. To the latter, I'm ok with giving it more time, I just don't want things to be prolonged unnecessarily.

I've left out certain details like the genders purposefully. Advice is welcomed.

But something I have to admit as a fitness enthusiast (mostly a gym rat who loves weight training and only plays sports purely for leisure) is that the state of the gyms around the school is pretty trash. Ok, the UTown gym is ""decent"" I'd say... Old but reliable and basic equipment, but oftentimes crowded as hell. The gym at MPSH is decent as well, but desperately in need of an upgrade and resupply of equipment. I've tried almost every other gym on campus including USC gym and even the hall gyms (let's exclude NUSS gym, I don't have access to that). I'm not hoping for the school to suddenly revamp the gyms, but I just wanna complain a bit :')

2997,"Ive liked this girl since JC. We were of different classes and she isnt the best looking girl in school but im somewhat attracted to her. During JC days, her friends shipped us together but she has always been avoiding me. Ive teased her quite abit, take photos with only the both of us too and her cheeks would blush every single time. However, when A levels was round the corner, i asked her friend if she actlly liked me but they replied no. I was heartbroken. 

Anyways fast forward 3 years later, which is today, she suddenly requested to follow me on insta. I was shocked. So i accepted and followed her back. Im 1 of the few guys she actually followed. It seems like a super private account as the few who followed her are her v close friends. Im just wondering what it actually means. Does it means she like me? I want to ask this question, but im afraid she will reject me like how her friend said the previous time. Just want to ask, what are the chances she is into me? If its high, ill probably muster my courage and ask.

2998,"This is to all the ppl asking ""is it normal if i dont want a rs"" even though my friends/family/colleague wtv all have and all keep asking me to get one:

YES IT'S NORMAL
The world has forced this idea on us that having a rs will complete you, and is something you want to chase because it will give you 99999 HAPPINESS. This has led to people thinking the only way to achieve satisfaction and success in life is to find a bf/gf, and what happens is people end up settling for someone -> ANYONE <- because they are more afraid of being alone than being with the wrong person.

If you are single and DESPERATE for any homosapian to be your bf/gf, ask yourself what the f are you actually looking for? Dont be a BODOH and think getting a rs means you will receive love and intimacy all the time, YOU must also be mentally and emotionally ready to put in effort. Relationships are not a TAKE TAKE TAKE, it is a GIVE and TAKE. The flower blooms only when showered with love. If you only want a bf/gf because you are lonely, please spare them.

Now, I have a boyfriend and we have been together for a few years now. However, my bf is neither ambitious nor good tempered. 

I happened to meet up with guy A recently and am still attracted to guy A. I can't help thinking about guy A whose character is more compatible with me - self-driven, ambitious and good tempered and if I had accepted him back then instead.

I’m from biz and he is from sci and we’re both y2 students. 
I would say that he is above average looking with a nice body, but his actions really shocked me? 
So we went to eat at pizza hut and we were given a small table, so he complained about it for 5 mins. And we saw 3 kids on the table beside us, and he looked at me deep in the eyes and said “kids are so cute! i want kids too”. wtf? it’s  only our first meeting? 
He also had pizza crumbs and cheese powder all over his clothes. 
I was so done after the meal so I wanted to leave quickly. At the cashier I asked him how much was it so we can split the bill. My math sucks so I asked how much is $47.70 divided by 2. I didn’t even finish my sentence. He said “23.85!!” and expects me to paylah him immediately. 

It was the worst date ever and guys please don’t do this on your first date with anyone.

In this world, the rich gets to pick their life. The poor lives the life they are given. The rest get the middle life while being fed the possibility of becoming rich. In this world, you need money to make money. You don't become rich from hard work. We live in a meritocracy, where you are rewarded based on result not effort.

3005,"I’m a girl and previously when I was in year, I had a few fwb. When I was in year 3, I met the love of my life. We clicked very well and loved each other very much. I cut all ties from my fwb once we were together. 

We have been together for 1 year now and everything is wonderful. He is a loving, sincere, smart and ambitious guy who dotes me a lot. We have met each other’s parents, talked about our future and booked a BTO just recently. 

He was evergreen and I’m his first girlfriend (which makes me feel even more special and lucky). Previously, he asked me whether I had any bf before him and I just said no. He asked whether I had a bf before and since fwb is not considered bf, I didn’t lie when I said no. 

I didn’t mention about my fwb history because he only asked whether I had bf. He didn’t ask about sex or fwb history. So I don’t think it’s necessary to tell him, especially since he is a staunch Christian.

Everything is good until a month ago when one of my fwb contacted me out of the blue. Apparently he knew I’m attached via my Instagram. He needed money and demanded me to give him 50k or else he would send our sex video to my bf. The video was taken when I was naive and wild and he also promised he won’t show to anyone! But now he is doing this to me!

Currently I’m devastated and don’t know what to do. I want to come clean to my bf but I’m scared he will think I deceived him, or at least didn’t tell him the whole truth which is very dishonest on my part, especially since he treated me wholeheartedly and sincerely. Also he is a staunch Christian, I don’t know what will happen. 

To make matter worse, if I don’t pay 50k, my fwb will not only show the video to my bf, he will also show to his parents and my parents. Even if my bf love me and accept for who I am (which is already difficult), I don’t know how his parents will think of me. And I don’t know if my bf will defend me against his parents when I’m the one hiding truth and have fwb history. My fwb know where my bf family and my family lives and threaten to show up on big occasions with like Christmas, Chinese New Year or our wedding when there’s a lot people and relatives. 

I really don’t know what to do. I thought of calling police for blackmailing but I think the matter will still blow up and people will know about it.

I also thought of just giving him 50k. But currently, with all my savings as a student, I have only around 40k. I don’t know how to get 10k in a few months time. I’m really sad and angry. I hate myself and I don’t know what to do. I absolutely can’t concentrate on my studies anymore. I even googled how to make money fast and learned that finding a sugardaddy is the fastest way to earn (around 3k a month with minimal commitment). But then, won’t I sinking deeper into the hole if I do it? But then again, if nobody find out, I might just be able to resolve the issue. 

Please help I really need advice on what I should do...

3007,"I graduated from NUS a year ago. Here’s my story. Tldr. 

My aunt, who is a motherly figure to me passed on in my first year of studies (Sem 2). It was a sudden death from stroke. Till today, it affects me so badly. I miss her so much and I cry say 3-4 times a week just thinking about it. 

In year 1, I also had a budding relationship with a guy. It certainly was an exciting phase of my life. I even told my aunt about the guy but had not introduced them to each other. Here’s the thing, the passing of my aunt was just too painful for me to bear. I didn't actually share my pain with the guy. 

Just mostly kept it in and carried on with life. I grieved super badly for about 3 months and cried every morning/ at night before bed.Then it was orientation camp period. I was super active during the summer so that kind of suppressed the grief a little. 

I grieved every now and then. But I wouldn't say it affected my daily life. Had and on-off relationship with the same guy throughout uni. It was exciting, it was fun. But I never truly opened up to him. I felt like I was portraying this image of myself to him. Sometimes I ranted to him about daily stuff and I think he got annoyed. Ultimately we broke up for good because our values didn't align me. I felt like I invested so much in the relationship (albeit not opening up). I gave in to him. I based my decisions around him. So it really hurt when at times he couldn't give in to me, couldn't understand my perspective, didn't invest in it as much as I did. I didn't have much friends throughout my time at NUS so I kinda felt that my 4 years here all went to naught. 

Like I just wasted my life on this guy, hung out so much with this guy-when I could have spent my remaining time back in year 1 with my aunt. I wished I didn't go for orientation camps and didn't meet the guy. 

Anyway, I kinda found closure with the guy. I mean I guess I learnt a lot through the relationship and even though things didn't work out, I'm glad I learnt from it.

So anyway after the breakup, for about the past year or so. I've been grieving Super badly over my aunt. It kinda feels like a delayed grieve reaction. I have so many regrets. And now that I'm earning quite a bit of money; but I can't pamper her anymore. 

Im not sure if it's because I'm no longer invested/ infatuated with someone that's why I can grieve properly or that I'm no longer busy chasing my CAP etc so I have time to think. Don't get me wrong, I was grieving throughout my undergrad years but it felt like I suppressed part of the emotions. 

Anyway I still miss my aunt so much and I rly don't know how I can go through the next few decades in my life without her.

Ya, so i rambled quite a bit. And no I’m not suicidal. There are ppl in this world whom I love. It’s just idk how I’d go on and that every sweet moment in life is pretty bittersweet to me. Just wondering if delayed grief reaction is normal. Actually I wouldn’t say it’s delayed la. Idk if it’s complicated grief cos there’s so many things I wish I did for my aunt and didn’t do. And I still miss her a lot. It hurts me like crazy. 

Thanks for reading my terribly convoluted post!

3011,"I am in a committed relationship with my girlfriend. We have been going out unofficially since sec school and dating officially since poly.  I have already unofficially proposed to her and we intend to get married after I graduate.

Sometime last semester, I met Jenny. Jenny is an angel who was banished from heaven for distracting her colleagues at work. Jenny is pretty, sweet and charming. Unlike my girlfriend, who is the more ""homely"" type and chose not to continue studying after poly, Jenny and I are both ambitious and career minded people. I feel that I am able to talk to Jenny about my career aspirations and life goals, conversations which are impossible with my current girlfriend. Also, unlike my girlfriend, who is obsessed with unwatchable kpop nonsense, Jenny and I share more common interests and there is never a shortage of things to talk about. We did projects in school together. We went for career fairs/school events together. We watched endgame together. We even stayed up late past midnight at my place for football (and other nighttime action).

I truly, honestly, fervently believe that Jenny is my soulmate, the girl that God planned for me to spend my life with. Sometimes, in the middle of a boring football game where both teams are playing leg tennis, I start to imagine my future with Jenny: buying a condo and car together, raising beautiful and smart kids together, saving up for retirement and migrating to australia together. Sometimes, in the middle of a really boring football game where both teams are playing leg golf, I fantasize about actually going ahead and breaking up with my girlfriend to be with Jenny.  There were times when I picked up my phone, composed a breakup text, hovered over the ""send"" button, said a prayer and... did nothing.

In the final analysis, I just couldn't do it. My relationship with my girlfriend is way too deep: we recently put down a deposit for BTO. I may no longer feel any love for my girlfriend, but responsibility trumps love.

This is not a confession looking for advice. I know what I must do: in fact, I did it already. The last time Jenny and I made love, we hugged each other tightly till morning came and she left my life forever like an angel on a sunbeam. 

Jenny, Jenny, Jenny... you are my june angel, my gem among many, my joy and my end. God played a cruel trick on both of us by letting us meet only when it was way too late. We will never be physically together ever again, but my mind, my soul, my spirit is yours, now and forever, till the end of our days.

After the event, she invited me for the afterparty (free entry), cause she say doesn't like clubbing with people that she's not close with, but I was out studying and not dressed to club. And if I wasn’t going, she was going to go home.

So I said no, and asked if she really wanted to club. Then she said kinda. She only told me she decided to go to the afterparty after I prompted her again. (Which I didn’t really like)

I figured maybe she didn’t want to spend money on a cab but then I wondered why didn’t she take the first train/bus at like 6am, but stayed till like 7am? But maybe they really did have a good chat.

Abit of background of this guy, he is a policeman and a married man. Despite out huge age gap, we somehow clicked and we played almost every night. However, school has started, my female friend rarely play together with us due to her hectic schedule and assignment due dates. And since i don't feel awkward while conversing with the guy, i continued playing with him on a daily basis. Recently, he suggested to have a meet up, claiming that he want to make friends as it is difficult to find friends that can click of so well. My female friend isnt fond of the idea so we have been rejecting him a couple of times. However, i felt that it's fine to make more friends so when he requested to meet up for a short 2 hours last Friday, i agreed (didnt let anyone know includong my parents, bcos they are against the idea od meeting up with online friends). It was just a simple meet up by having lunch, buying screen protector for my new phone and he went off for work.

During the meet up, although i insisted on paying for my meal, he did not want to accept my money so he treated me. I mentioned that i will treat him back but he said, ok only when ive started working. Anyways, after lunch, we went on to purchase a screen protector. He helped to stick the protector but failed as it was the protector that requires help from LED. He felt guilty so he took my phone to find another vendor which sells screen protector and also provide the service of sticking it while i sat and waited at starbucks. After he came back, i wanted to return the money to him, but he insisted not to reveal how much it cost. By this time, it was already a little over 5pm and he left for work. I sent him to the mrt and a few minutes later he texted me. We carried on texting for a few minutes and he expressed his gratitude for meeting up and i also expressed mine for the treats. I think he was worried that the meetup was awks as he kept asking so i reassured that everything was alright.

I only told my parents this incident today over lunch and they kind of lectured me, saying that it was adnormal for a married man to meet up with someone my age. But throughout the 3 months, including the meetup, i felt that he was a decent man and i sincerely treated him as an older brother. I have no other romantic feelings for him. My parents told me that i should not have went out. Now im so lost. I really dont know if he is a bad/good person. Like i really have nothing he can cheat imo. And i dont mean to spoil his family in anyways or so. Any advice?

A little background about myself. I am in my final year too (FASS) and I have experienced how others can have so much work-life balance while scoring good grades while I had to stay up late night to churn out mediocre grades for the same assignment. It was really devastating to know that you are never as good as them.

After Y2 and things started to change. Instead of thinking that that you can never be as good, I tried to tell myself that I just have to find a talent. Instead of comparing yourself with others, I tried to understand the joy of improving. Overtime, I realized I am not a FASS type of person as I daringly explored other options like science.

It is the leap of faith that you have to take and never give up on finding your strength!

3045,"Hi, i need some advice here. I have this best friend that i known for more than 10 years since young. Like a childhood friend. We grew up together and were from the same sch throughout till now in NUS. So it started out in sec sch where we got closer and more comfortable with each other, theres this one cca basketball practice where we showered together and were very open with one another.
We became best of bros and everytime i go to his house we are naked studying in his room??? And he even initiated watching porn together(mind u, he is attached with his gf at that time). So i said ok and we somehow became more than best friends. So despite having a girlfriend, we still help each other mutually as we are bro fap buddies. Fast forward, i now have a girlfriend but she says im not forking out enough time for her?? Half the time shes always complaining that i spend more time with my best friend than her but what m i suppose to do when i alr know him for almost a decade??
My gf ever mentioned that shes opened to the idea of a threesome, im not sure if she will be ok with the idea of a 3some with my best friend, seeing that she gets very jealous of our strong friendship most of the time.
I too, am not very sure if i am alright with some guy penetrating her, i dont really like to share my girlfriend as im very possessive and i dont like the idea of her being used by someone else. Im thinking that maybe he can penetrate me instead? 
Besides these, my best friend is currently single and i dont want him to feel lonely on his own. I am thinking of proposing the idea of a three-person relationship with her, ill probably be more alright with my best friend screwing her if the 3 of us are in a relationship, but this is so uncommon in singapore n im not sure how it will work out.

The background is that he is a nice person who finds it hard to say no. Eg extra work allocated for project he will take it, people ask him for favor he will say yes. I’m not sure if he is agreeing to the invite simply because he doesn’t know how to say no. 

I feel like asking him out one on one but I am worried that he only likes me as a friend? But I guess based on his character he will likely say yes but whether he likes me or not I would have to probe further...

But he's very smart, and few of times I couldn't understand stuff, he patiently helped explain the concept to me. He's fairly tall, quirky and a bit nerdy, but really really nice. Sometimes he would crack a joke, or make a funny remark, and everyone in the tutorial room would laugh. He was really the life of the class.

I managed to get his contact, and started messaging him the past June break. (There was actually another guy I was seeing a bit, but we kinda called it off because he had too many commitments.) Eventually, we met up in school, and had a really nice chat which lasted quite a few hours. I felt like we could really work something out together, and eventually asked him if he wanted to…you know. (Come on, it’s 2019. Someone’s gotta take the initiative.) I think he also felt like we could make something happen, and I’m glad to say that we’ve been together for almost two months. :)

And when it came down to…business, he liked to go hard. I couldn’t really take it at first, but he said to trust him, and I’d learn to like it. And sure enough, I did! Now he says that I do it quite fast…almost too fast haha.

3061,"Is this seeking advice? Thank you for your time to read though.

Background, I used to have one ‘friend’ whom I love dearly and sincerely. I lost him, but he still remains as the most important person in my life, and the effect he has on my life is (italic) extreme (italic).

He is going to POP next week Saturday, yet very unfortunately, our friendship is broken and lost. I cannot go and support him, to show how severe and harsh the situation is: I cannot even drop him a message or talk to him anymore.
 
Hence the bottom line is that 1) I cannot go to his POP next Saturday and 2) I cannot even message or talk to him so there is no chance I can just appear randomly, pretending I am seeing someone else just so I can see him from afar, how he is doing and etc (Hey I am not a stalker, I respect him a lot. Don’t misread the aforementioned).

Hence, next Saturday will be a very tedious day. The heart wants to go and see him, missing him so much and all but since I cannot go = I am trying to find a way how to cope on that day, to run away from reality, anything and everything. I do not have a home due to family issues, so I wanted to hide in the place I met him (since I have so many years of history in that place).

Actually it is just my former school, good thing is that it is a polytechnic so it is a public place. I thought of hiding there and drinking my heart out (not that it works but I do not know what to do anyway). Bad thing is I am very concerned of meeting his peers. Because I have a feeling they would mock or taunt me. Bad things happened, I am quite traumatized by them to have been avoiding the place for a very, very long time. Except that I really have no other place to run or hide anymore.

Confusing right? I wrote it in my emotions so that is the truest and purest, or most accurate form but TLDR: I am struggling to cope with an event next Saturday. With no home and nowhere to go, I could only go to a place my memories were built and my life was based on. Unfortunately I risked being further traumatized by a group of people.  

What about his Post-POP week? How do I cope with the entire week?

3065,"Referring to #68787. To set the stage clear, I am a pharmacist working in a hospital. I respect doctors and I believe good inter-professional relationships between pharmacists and doctors (or any other other healthcare professional for that matter) is important. I say that because I believe we should not think of the issue of pharmacists having sole dispensing rights as pharmacists fighting over doctors for these rights, or doctors 'oppressing' pharmacists. 

The issue about pharmacists having sole dispensing rights is one about medication safety and optimising patient care. Granting pharmacists sole dispensing rights ensures that all prescriptions are checked so that medication errors can be rectified and patients can get the best care. Pharmacists can also value-add by providing other services like identifying medication-related issues during dispensing, and giving more in-depth and tailored counselling than an untrained clinic assistant. 

I have personally seen many questionable prescriptions from GPs, such as inappropriate use/choice/duration/dose of antibiotics, contributing to antibiotic resistance, as well as other medication errors. I am sure many pharmacists can attest to that. These errors happen because there is no one to counter-check if the medications prescribed are appropriate and safe. Such errors are greatly minimised in places like hospitals because there are pharmacists to ensure the appropriateness of each medication prescribed. 

To clarify, I am not downplaying the competency/importance of doctors. They are the most important people in a patient's care (along with nurses) but we need to realise that doctors are also humans. They do not know everything and mistakes can occur. And perhaps as one of the commentors wrote, we should look into the actual frequency of medication errors, as well as the value that pharmacists, as experts in medication use, can provide in preventing them. 

I agree that patients having to go somewhere else to collect their medications will be a hassle and may cause compliance issues. Increased costs for patients is also an issue. However, I these should not be reasons as to why a patient's care should be compromised. These are issues that can possibly be worked around with creative solutions. Perhaps there could be a centralised 24/7 centre where GPs have to send prescriptions to, for the prescriptions to be checked by a pharmacist, before someone at the clinic can physically dispense the medication to the patient? Of course, this is just an idea, possibly flawed, and I acknowledge I may not have a perfect solution. But the point is, as PM Lee once said, ""we need to come up with creative ideas and solutions"". Regarding the point on increased costs for patients, we should also not forget that there will be savings in other costs such as decreased utilisation of healthcare resources resulting from inappropriate medication use. For example, inappropriate antibiotic use contributes to multi-drug resistant bacterial infections which will incur huge costs. Perhaps some form of subsidy from the government can take away the burden of extra costs for patients. 

TLDR: Pharmaciats should be given sole dispensing rights on the basis that they are the experts in medication use and should play a bigger role in ensuring safety and optimal medication use in a patient's treatment, whether or not in the hospital or community setting.

3079,"Hi. I’m a female and I need help in understanding a male friend’s behaviour. This is not a fake story, just need some advice.

I got to know this guy friend 1 year ago and we kinda clicked well. After 1 week knowing each other, he started to call me at night. There was once he called me till 4am. He was already attached back then and still together with his gf till now while I am single.

So with that fact, I thought he was just treating me as good friend. However, there was a time when he told me that his gf was unhappy that he hung out with me (not sure why he told me this). On top of that, his friends made the matter worse by saying that I look better than her in front of her (sorry, I know it sounds like i’m complimenting myself here but that’s not the point). He told me that if he treated someone as good friend, regardless of his gf’s opinion, he would still hang out with the person.

That made me feel valued as a friend but it made me confuse as hell too. Of course, I did tell him that he shouldn’t treat his gf that way. I even asked him to bring his gf out for a meal and introduced to me so that there was no misunderstanding. But it was rejected. So knowing his gf’s unhappiness, I started to keep distance from him. I didn’t hang out with him for 3 months and barely replied his messages. Whenever he bumped into me, he would guilt trip me by saying that I became cold and no longer treated him as friend. I tried to come up with some reasons telling him that I was too busy but he didn’t buy it. On my birthday, he asked me out 1 month in advance so I had no excuse to say no. He was very gentleman. He booked grab for me so that I didn’t have to take public transport and treated me to nice Japanese restaurant. I felt awful for treating him badly. But I also found out that he didn’t tell his gf that he went out with me. On Vday, he bought a bouquet of flowers for me and didn’t tell his gf too.

I asked my male friends about this and they were sure that he had feelings for me. But I did question him a couple times about his current relationship and I know he is still happily attached with his gf. Am I being overly sensitive? Does platonic relationship really not exist between male and female? I’m not sure if I should continue keep my distance or maintain this friendship. Thanks for your advice in advance.

We've been going back together ever on days we have classes together and sometimes I'll wait for her even though my classes end much earlier so that we can go back together. 

1. Is it normal for a female friend to let you see her to her MRT stop even though your stop is before hers?

2. Is it normal for a female friend to text you and ask what you're doing or how you are? (nobody ever texts me or shows concern unless they need something from me that benefits them - even my own parents)

3. Is it normal for a female friend to share her earphones/piece/pod with your and watch videos or listen to music together when you're on the MRT going back together?

It's funny how people are showing contempt for technological innovations and choosing to embrace a primitive mindset by refusing to move forward with times. 

Yes, I'm aware that there have been some injuries as a result of pedestrians jaywalking across walkways without even bothering to check their surroundings. But isn't it a small price worth paying for the conveniences of a car-lite future? Think about how quickly you get your food when you order through delivery services. Or how you or your kids can now travel the distances previously attainable only by a car, without the hassle of obtaining a driver’s license which can be quite expensive. Too bad for all you haters, but I'm glad the authorities have the foresight not to completely ban the devices, knowing full well of the economic and social implications. Neither have they bowed down to populist demands to have omnipresent enforcement at void decks, which would be an unnecessary strain on resources. 

I'm sure that as someone who is most likely to support technological progress, Prof Ben will also agree with me that those who condemn PMDs are backward in their thinking and are in some ways, stifling innovation in our country.

Pharmacist here as well. OP may sound salty to those people who are not in this profession but trust me, OP is very on point and he/she clearly understands the situation the profession is in now. Prospective juniors need to understand that pharmacy is not a specialized profession at all. 

Clinically, we are halfway in between Doctors and Nurses, just patching up the gaps and serve as a final line of defence against medication errors. The clinical field will live on without us. In fact, most of the countries do not even have pharmacist. We work long hours, and we are underappreciated by everyone, but it is ok if you have the passion for healthcare. Sole dispensing right is completely impossible given the amount of $ it needs to hire a pharmacist when the GP doctor can pretty much handle everything themselves. 

Scientifically, whether we do chemical synthesis (competitor chemistry students), biological studies (competitor life science grads, biomedical grads etc etc), industry positions (internal competitor pharmaceutical science), we are only half way there while the others are actually way more specialized than us.

So as long as we see pharmacy as a general profession and leverage on that flexibility of being able to jump around different industries, i would say it is a pretty good degree to go for :)

3097,"Have you read the news recently? There was an article about a parent losing her child to suicide. The child was only 18 years old. I cannot imagine how it must have felt for the parent. Bringing up your child for so many years, caring and loving for him. One day, he is just taken from you, leaving you with nothing.

When he left me, that is what I thought and what I would have done. I wanted to end my life, I do not want to live on anymore. 

But I have a message to everyone. Everyone have their own reasons, it is not about judging as we do not understand their perspective (just like how I am already fully expecting to get a lot of backlash for ending my life for another person). 

Even if you do not want to live on anymore, you might as well continue to live for the sake of living for your parents. It is not about enjoying life, or ‘living’. It is just about responsibility to make up to your parents.

Time and effort aside, the cost of raising a child could go up to $500k. Have you even ‘repay’ your parents this amount of money? = But actually they don’t want money anyway. They spend their crucial period (Age 20-30s) devoting so much time and effort to you. Money can never make it up.

How about feelings? Emotions? The news would come as trauma, potentially leaving them with PTSD. How about coping with the grief and loss of your departure?

Right now, I am trying to ‘repay’ as much as I could, spending as much time as possible with them like going out to buy groceries with them, giving them a lot of money (more than triple of what I spend), talking to them and buying them new food to try. The list goes on. 

I love you Braxton. I love you very much. I will love you forever. But I cannot die for you until the day my parents passed on. It feels like living a ‘double’ life, one façade to present to everyone else in order to perform and function normally to bring results, and my true hollow self being dragged and forced on to live.

Is it normal to be jealous of you brother's gf? I'm 21; he's 26 and the gf is 25 this year. He had 2 exes but he wasn't in a serious rs the previous times so I this odd feeling did not exist. However, my brother seems to be super serious with this current gf and whenever we have htht, she will be brought into the convo. He always share his dream of putting the wedding ring on her finger and how he want 3 kids after marriage etc. Jealousy always kicks in whenever this happens. It feels as though I would be stripped off from all the love and attention he'd showered upon me for the past 21 years, once he gets married.

He is an awesome brother, best friend and advisor, basically my emotional pillar of 21 years. And the thought of us living under different roofs one day bugs me all the time. It got even stronger when he is starting to plan the proposal recently.

I know this is absolutely wrong, and I know how I contradict myself when I claim I want him to have a blissful marriage but on the other hand, avoiding all interactions with his current gf. I honestly feel awfully bad about having these feelings lingering and being so possessive over my brother. But i cannot possibly tell him this to worry him, right? I guess his gf can sense it too and I'm afraid it will affect their rs. Times when she wanted to pass my a gift or strike a convo, I made up an excuse and locked myself in the bedroom till she left or simply left the house to take a breather.

3104,"So there's something I need to get off my chest. I've had this close friend,  that I've known for almost half a decade now. So basically before I came to uni la. She's, well overseas, so I don't really get to see her often, if at all anymore. But we're still close, like we didn't let distance get to us, and in a sense we're still really like playmates over text, and we still meet during holidays. And well, thing is, after all this time, I think I've still retained most of my feelings about her, since some time ago, and that still really hurts. Mostly cause I'm pretty sure she doesn't really see us as anything more than friends. 
I mean don't get me wrong, it's not like I make an effort to keep friendships only if there any chance of romance but, I guess after a while it's starting to get to me that I should come to terms with my feelings remaining unrequited.

I hate this honestly. Why did I have to fall for someone so out of reach, like sometimes I'd wonder what would have happened instead had I also gone overseas instead of staying here. But I guess that alternative would have been like the theoretical no-no, y'know? Like people shouldn't just choose the uni and country based on like relationships, let alone some random crush that's not going to make it anywhere.

I've been keeping all this to myself of course, because I don't think it's really something that she needs to deal with, and really I can only see it souring up our friendship, especially if I don't take the rejection well (surprise surprise it already sounds like I won't, doesn't it?).

Sometimes I wish I could just bottle all this up and throw it away and really just idk, find someone else or something and not have to really think about all this. But hey, if my feelings were that disposable, it wouldn't have hurt this much in the first place right?

If I wanted to do sales, I'd rather sell something which I know what I am talking about, and at least it is an actual product that has utility to the buyer. Best case is when a buyer already knows what they want, all that is required is to tell them where it is placed. Not harass acquaintences on  ̶s̶o̶s̶h̶e̶r̶ social media and cold calling in a bid to grow  ̶d̶o̶w̶n̶l̶i̶n̶e̶s̶ legs while doing the same for an upline.

Yes, retail can be one long chain from the manufacturer to the importer/distributor to the reseller to the consumer, with each stage adding more to the cost the consumer pays. Of course there are things like import taxes and customs along with the guarantee of warranty, so maybe some real value is being added along the line in terms of product support and bringing the item to somewhere the consumer can obtain it. Case in point, there was a posting that almost thought Prof Ben ran a logistics company. That is actually the local distributor of some electronics you might be using, but you might not be able to get direct from them. Money comes in from outside the manufacturer, product(without artificial demand from inside the company) transfers to the consumer on the outside. There might be some backdoor deals going on in terms of that logistics chain, but be it Challenger or a shop in Sim Lim Square, the general idea is there.There are also online channels now, so no hard selling from store staff.

TLDR: Avoid MLMs like the plague, if want to do sales, work for reputable stores and/or brands.

I don’t know whether it is you who wrote the confession but I have been longing for you for so long. Ever since I started working in a new place for the past days and months, I had made alot of amazing friends who are more cheerful than you and gained alot of experience more than the place we worked together. To be honest, I am much more happy when I have new workplace, perhaps you are very happy too without me being working together with you anymore. 

This world doesn’t accept the lovely bond of both of us and you are the one who said that we are nothing but only as a friend. Only God know how hurtful my heart is when you told me such a words. 

We had fun alot to be honest, perhaps we enjoyed the time being together, along these years. But along the way, our heart changed and it makes for both of us having hard time to forget each other. Perhaps it is just a few stairs away from each other, but I am like you whom feel like it is million miles a way. 

You don’t need to force yourself to stop contacting me. I am the one who deciding to be away from you, for the sake of our hearts’ healing. You are never been as someone lousy in my eyes, no matter how much mistakes you did, I will always forgive you as you are always perfect in my eyes. 

Don’t blame it on our circle of life, as it comes from our own heart who decided to be separated like this. Perhaps because of our differences in preferences of feeling, we are ended up like this. 

Yes, we are strangers now, but I always peek at your glances whenever we passed thru each other, seeing unto your eyes who longing for being together with each other, where I have been longing for it too. 

Perhaps we are not ended well in terms of our friendship and relationship, but I always love you for the way you are but you are already have someone with you now and this is the time I will go away and forget your existence. But always remember, I will always love you. Maybe in 10 or 20 or 30 years in time, you will have a family and I might be still as a single star who longing for an Earth whom only looks at the moon, waiting for my own shine to fade.

3112,"To all my juniors studying Pharmacy:
Singapore is a place where the profession of Pharmacy goes to die. Don't believe in the consoling words of the likes of Lita Chew or any Pharmacist that paints you a rosy picture of the profession as reality is far from what they describe. Moreover, you cannot expect a profession governed by Pharmacists that believe that the road should be long and arduous, where hours spent at a job are valued more than hours spent being productive. Pharmacists are not well respected in Singapore precisely because we do not have sole dispensing rights, unlike countries like USA. Doctors in Singapore are able to prescribe and dispense, why bother having Pharmacists at all when we are a failsafe that can be easily bypassed?
But if you still decide to go down this path, all power to you for choosing to sacrifice everything for a marginal improvement to society without being recognised for it. Prepare to spend many hours just languishing in this job which does not command a high pay, respect or any semblance of work-life balance, even while you are still training to be a Pharmacist. (Trust me, I've been through this as well) 
To all my colleagues being easily pacified with the talk of ""limited prescribing rights"" for Pharmacists, don't be fooled by this move which is obviously just a politically correct move made by the Singapore Pharmacy Council. Why on earth will the country need another person with prescribing rights and why would you want to fight over the same domain as Doctors when you are trained professionally in the use of medications and should be working complementary to the Doctors?
The solution is to remove dispensing rights for Doctors and establish it as a Pharmacist-only role. This will even out the prospects of the jobs. But this is an uphill task as Doctors will not want to give up prescribing rights since it's a significant source of income for them, all the while charging exorbitant consultation fees.
Though a point can be made in this post, we are unlikely to see any changes without the old guard holding high ranking positions in Pharmacy giving up their roles and allowing those with a more modernist thinking take their places.

I never had one night stands/friends with benefits/casual sex/committed relationships before. How does having sex even......happen? Does the guy initiate and propose, then the girl accepts? Or does that just naturally happen without anyone asking out loud? Why hadn’t anyone verbally asked me? Why has every other girl I know been “asked”? Did someone ask them, or do they just spontaneously take their clothes off? 

Also, I never gone on massive shopping spree before. I always see people around me buy around 2-3 clothes every month, and their money just naturally flows out. They buy dresses, skirts, and makeup every month (some even every week) without batting an eyelid! They seem to have a lot of money ( to me at least) but whenever I ask them, they casually answer “Zara and Topshop are not very expensive what! Forever 21, H&M, the Editors market are cheap!” 

But I see that they spend $200 (around that amount) on clothes and makeup every other week/month, and i can’t bring myself to spend so much so naturally. What if I got no savings then how? Is it that easy to .....fritter away 100-200 on clothes all the time? 

I am not sure if I have ever felt “touched” or “moved” by song lyrics. When people sing about sharing a bed every night with someone they love, when people sing about how the bed is emptying because they lost someone they love, i stare at the lyrics blankly because I never got hugged to sleep. I never had a Boyfriend/fwb/ons. 

I never cried over song lyrics because I cannot relate. I don’t even know how to make my money naturally flow out, how do i make emotions naturally flow?

A few years has passed and while we still follow each other on social media, I haven't made any attempts to recover our friendship. I tried to ask how she's been last year but was only blue-ticked. I would love to be able to gain back a friend, and not remain unknown enemies but i do not know how to go about it. Any advice?

3123,"This girl has been my study buddy and labmate for some modules for the last couple of years. Over time, my fondness for her grew. She is streetsmart, academically smart, caring, and good looking. She comes from a family with financial difficulties, and she works part-time to help her family. Lately, I got signals from her that my fondness is reciprocated. We just got into year 4 and I thought it is a good time to confess. So I did a couple of weeks ago. She said she likes me too, but she wanted me to know some things about her that I did not know, which of course, she expects me to keep secret. She told me that her part-time work is as an escort, which involves physical aspects as well. She added that she wouldn't have been able to maintain her social life, academics, CCAs etc. if her financial support to her family came from a normal seven dollar per hour part-time work. I am not one of those guys who expect the partner to have zero sexual experience even though I am in that category myself - I had voluntarily declined chances to be off the mark casually and am proud to have done so. I find it hard to come to terms with it and be with her, though in all other aspects she is too good to let go. She understands that it is not an easy decision, and has told me to take as much time as I want to think it over. She will keep her part-time work suspended in the meantime, and will terminate it if we get together. It is very easy to say “if you like someone, his/her past shouldn’t matter”, until you are in the hot seat yourself. Not really looking for advice, just sharing it here to get it off my chest.

3124,"I went for an internship during the holidays. During the internship, I had a brief fling with a guy from another department (not directly linked to my department, so no ethical issues there). 

Recently, I received a return offer from the same company. To my horror, this guy's email is included in the cc list. Apparently his rank in the company is higher than I thought (?) I really want to work in this company, but I am afraid that things might be awkward. 

Two questions:
1. How common is it to cc someone from a different department in a return offer email? Does it mean that I will be working with him?
 
2. Should I take up the return offer? Just for clarification, I am a girl and I was the one who initiated the breakup.

3127,"So I have had a lot girls, for whom I’ve had feelings for but they haven’t really liked me back or have just friendzoned me. The way I have dealt with these feeling so far is that everytime, someone has broken up with me, rejected me or I have felt that they don’t like me, I have suppressed those feelings, instead of actually trying to resolve them. The way I have gone about this is to replace the feelings and fantasies about that person, with fantasies about another person (whom I haven’t actually had feelings for). The fantasies are mostly non-sexual. Just mostly about what my life would be like if I were together with that person. Mostly just romantic. It has mostly been successful so far.  

So the situation right now is this. I had feelings for a girl, lets call her Person A. I liked her for a long time and I eventually confessed to her and she rejected me. So then I proceeded to suppress those feelings by replacing her with another person (Person B) in my fantasies. Person B is someone I know. The problem is that  as a side effect of this strategy, I ended up falling for Person B. I realise that Person B isn’t interested in me so I tried to suppress my feelings for her by fantasising about Person C but now I feel I am digging my hole deeper. Person C is a platonic friend whom I was never interested in, romantically. Now I realise that in the process of trying to suppress my feelings for person B, I have started developing feelings for Person C. (It’s a mess I know). So I halted the process in the middle.  

I don’t want to confess to either person B or C because they are both my friends and I dont want to sabotage my friendship, even though getting rejected might help me move on. So now, even though I eventually got over person A  I have unresolved feelings for B and C.  And this is seriously messing with my head and it is confusing me no end. I don’t think either of them actually like me, romantically and they are both out of my league. So what do I do? How do I recover my sanity again? How do I stop myself from feeling this way?

I thought of being less vocal about my problems and hiding my worries from him, but this forms the core of our relationship. He said that although having such an open communication leads to this kind of situations where we feel helpless and unable to help one another, in doing so we also share our burdens and it’s something we value and cherish.

3135,"Went out with this guy from my course when we were both in year 1, and maybe a couple weeks later he mentioned that he's got a DSLR if I wanted to go out and take some photos.

One thing led to another and we ended up at one of the hourly rate hotels, where some stuff happened and I had some rather intimate photos taken before we went on to hook up. So he's got them on his SD card and he mentions that he'll send me a copy once he's done.

A few days later, he sends me the shots and they're pretty well done, to be honest. A couple of weeks later feeling guilty over the entire hook-up thing I decided to break off all contact with him. It helps that his clique is not really friends with my friends so I get to avoid him easily. And then he got attached, so it got even easier.

This sem, half our cohort is on IA and we're taking the same design module. Thankfully he's not in my group, or under the same supervisor, so no problems there.

I'm just worried that he's still got the photos of me stored away somewhere, and I'm also worried that his girlfriend who's in the same course might see them too and there goes my face la.

I'm not sure what to do. On one hand, they're not like post-sex selfies and they're really well done, but on the other hand I would prefer it if he doesn't have a copy of them. But the thing is it's been like 2 years and I don't know if he even remembers their existence.

Should I ask him to delete them (if he still has them) or is it a bad idea to remind him about them?

Usually I go to the canteen by myself. So when I get a table I have the entire table to myself. I eat pretty quickly so people could get their meal asap. Sometimes I feel the empty seats could be better optimised rather than having one entire table to myself. But sometimes people are shy to ask to share seats

So suggest that a few tables get drawn into an area for people who come alone, just wanna eat and quickly leave. Singles who want to sit at this area don’t need to ask permission and can just come in and sit (since we don’t have that’s long table for one person kind). So you have these tables filled up and better utilitised (without the paisehness to ask people to share seat)

(Also urge guys try not to sit at the canteen for too long after  eating so others can come in especially peak period when 2,3 faculties share a canteen)

2) Hope there will events for tree planting. Climate change is a huge threat and we’ve seen the Amazon forest fires and melting of ice caps. Hopefully at least we can do a small part no matter how tiny...

3138,"Theres a paradox that exists in NUS CCAs, and I am losing hope in uni life. A little background: I'm a girl who has pretty severe social anxiety and dont really have friends, merely a literal handful of hi-bye acquaintances whom I cannot hold a conversation with because I am an awkward potato. 

""Join CCAs to make friends!"" Is what they say, and I believed them. I stay on campus but not in Hall/RC so I only get to join Nus-wide CCAs. And I want to actually have some fun and perhaps make friends during my four years in nus, hence I want to join CCAs. Because as much as I get anxiety when I meet people, I still crave social contact. I was quite excited during SLF, and went to the booths to check out the CCAs. Where the various CCA groups introduce themselves, and they emphasised on ""bringing your friends along"" to the welcome tea. Which is really ironic because firstly, I do not have friends, hence I want to join a CCA. And secondly, even if i had friends they may not be interested in the same things. 

I went to a couple of welcome teas, where again, the seniors introduced the CCA as ""a CCA where you can come along with your friends and do <activity> together"". I went for a few introduction sessions too. And unsurprisingly most people turn up with their friends, in pairs, in groups. And why would they bother making new friends when they already had their friends with them in the CCA? 

I do realise that the problem may lie in me rather than in the CCAs themselves. It is my inability to socialise that is preventing me from making friends, because I am just that kind of boring, hopeless, loner. And it is my problem that I do not have sports experience and therefore cannot join any varsity teams where perhaps it would be less of a ""join with your friends"" thing and more of a ""bond with your new teammates"" thing. I know that there is no sure-fire way to make friends, but I somehow wish that there is something I can do. To stop being so sad all the time. 

And so everyday I feel helplessly lonely. Such that everyday I contemplate withdrawing from NUS because the loneliness is killing me. Or contemplate transferring courses to one that has a three day work week instead of my current 5 day work week, so that I dont have to be so alone while being among people for so many days. It probably doesnt help that I stay on campus where I dont know anyone around me because it is freaking PGPR, where I honestly havent heard of any other local freshies staying in. And I contemplate forfeiting the ~2.5k that I have paid to move in, just so that I can be around my family (which I am not particularly close to, but they are family), and maybe the 4 hours of travel time to and from school everyday will make me so shag that I can forget how lonely I am. 

Oh, and, my social anxiety also manifests itself in what google considers an eating disorder. Because I am afraid to eat alone. And since coming to NUS I have been alone most of the time, and have been skipping quite a few meals. Instead I just eat little snacks in my room cos at least I dont have to be seen eating alone. And I have to force myself to get at least one meal everyday because the crowd and the noise in the canteens freaks me out. And this skipping of meals has caused me to lose a few kgs, which means that my clothes from a few years back actually fit me again, which is good, but still I worry for my physical self. And though it's been almost an entire month since I moved in to PGPR, I've never eaten at the canteens before cos I'm intimidated by the large number of foreigners, cos I'm just that pathetic. 

And I am at my wits end because uni life feels absolutely hopeless right now. Perhaps this is just my destiny to be alone forever. Because if I cant find friends in uni, what's to say about adult/working life? Which makes life seem really hopeless, because what even is the point of living when you have no friends, no one whom you are close to, no one to share the ups and downs of life with, no one to talk to?

As to reply to what Mr HONG WEI TAY commented, it's not that I can't do much outside at work, it's the fact that you did not even understand what I am going through now, and you are just assuming the fact that I am a person who gives up easily when things are turning harsh.

Why do I feel like giving up? Just to let you know that it's not only about my full time work and part time degree studies, I am also taking up a language class during my weekends as well. It means that I am working full time, AS WELL AS studying in 2 different schools. 

This is the reason why I feel like giving up, because for my job, I have to standby after working hours, meaning I have a chance that I need to go back to work after working hours. On top of that, I have to attend 2 schools, 1 on weekdays at night, 1 on the weekends. Attending both schools means that I have alot more assignments/homework to do as well. Do you even understand that?

3149,"Hi, 

Long post ahead. 

I just want to encourage all those who are struggling with your studies/work/finances/relationships/life in general to keep pushing on. 

I am in my final year and my NUS journey is nothing but 7 consecutive semesters of struggle, occasionally interspersed with bouts of joy and relief. People around me are somehow always so intelligent and quick to grasp concepts - the same ideas I can take hours and days or even weeks to finally understand. 

When people spend 3 hours to churn out an essay and get an A, I spend 3 days planning its outline and researching, and get only a B+. People tell me to study smart and not hard and I already know that (I have read many articles and books and watched videos on it) but I just don't know why. Over time, when people tell me to study smart and not hard, it sounds more sarcastic and hypocritical than constructive lol. 

It doesn't help that I have to work part time and I don't have a domestic helper or automated cleaning machine to clean up the house. Some toxic friends/people I have met mocked me for ""having no life"" outside of family and school. Some commented that I am a ""country bumpkin"" because I don't travel or go for exchange. Some say I'm unfriendly because I don't hang out with them often at overpriced hipster cafes. They don't know that my parents are ageing and getting weaker.  I don't want them to do too much housework or demand for them to pay for my school fees, overseas holiday, give me pocket money so I can go eat some avocado egg toast that looks better than it tastes. 

But I'm not here to complain because I have learnt that complaining is extremely addictive, playing victim to uncontrollable circumstances feels particularly good, but it is also very unhelpful. Nothing is going to change for the better if I sit here and cry about how bad my life is. 

Look, I know its hard and I know everyday feels like giving up when there's no visible end in sight. You don't know if things will eventually turn out well and you don't know whether your hard work will pay off.

But you have to remember that in this moment, despite all the uncertainty, your best option is to keep trying even if you fail repeatedly. There is no shame in trying your best. Of course it sucks not to see rewards when you keep trying so hard but at least you can be accountable to your conscience and be absolutely free of guilt when things really do not turn out your way. 

Others who make you feel bad about your life problems should be ignored. I have cut off toxic people in my life and while I am left with only a few friends, they are more than enough. Sometimes it's lonelier to be with the wrong people. 

You are not a let down when the outcomes don't reflect your hard work. It's just that things can and will never be the way we want to, no matter how many excel spreadsheets you create to plan some ideal vision of a future you strive for. It is this that is what makes life interesting. 

Hang on and stay strong.

There’s always that few students that hog the floor by asking and voicing their opinion every 5mins, which: prevents other students from getting their chance to participate, and causes the lecture to extend another 20-30mins.

She wouldn’t act as affectionately. Even whenever I would put my arm around her she won’t react. She doesn’t get very close to me even when we are talking to each other.

Hello, I'm a female full time international student here. I came here and afforded everything myself by studying and working at the same time.

I only had $200 per month for this rent as my family's situation gets worse. 

So, I am seeking for help, though it is actually against the school's rule. If possible, any one staying in single room in halls, could be able to host me with $200/month, please let me know. I'm very clean (like seriously) and I come out to study every day so I won't bother you when you're inside the room. I never go out over night, and I am a humble kind. I just need a space to sleep and shower. It's really hard so far for me.

I probably just need to stay in till the end of this semester, as next semester I will be out for internship, and earn a bit more to afford a new room. Please help if you can. Please email me at: luna.luvegood94@gmail.com.

Thank you so much!

He's playing this game which I did not catch the title of, but I can hear words like ""first blood"", ""an ally has been slained"", ""enemy has slained Lord"" and ""your team has destroyed an enemy"". From the sound of it, it sounds like a very violent game. I am very concerned that my bf is playing games that involves killing people. More importantly, when I look at the character my bf is using, it's always a girl character that looks like a child. Is it an early sign of pedophilia? I feel that it is a red flag and  I feel that I don't think he'll be a good father to my children. How do I let him know the reason I want to break up with him?

He displays his unhappiness on his face and actions to the point it affects me. I would usually give practical advise on how to aid the issue but it’ll mostly fall on deaf ears. Mind you, he’s angry at a situation not caused by me. 

Sometimes I feel like he can be a ‘girl’ emotional wise and it’s exhausting for me to keep up. Don’t get me wrong, we are still very much in love but sometimes I just get tired from his behaviour and attitude. I have tried talking to him about this and he acknowledged it but anger is still a feeling very hard to control. I don’t wish for this to sour our relationship.

I felt so shagged out because there's this lecture class that never fails to end late. Class was supposed to end at 10pm, the professor would still be teaching and only releasing us at 1015pm, which causes me to reach home at 1045pm from taking the taxi/grab. After reaching home I still have to prepare and my stuffs for work and/or night class for the next day, and what's worse is that I have to wake up at 530am to go to work. There are still assignments to be done for my degree mods, and I feel like I have no time at all, especially when this prof is always taking up our time and giving out so much assignments after class.

I know it's only been 3 weeks of my 4 years part time university life, but I feel like dropping out of school already as I do not think I could endure this 4 years. However, if I do drop out, then I would not have a degree, and I feel that I could not progress as fast in the society, especially when so many people are having a degree cert and when the market is so competitive outside now. I need opinions, what should I actually do?

3176,"Hi SoC alumni/fresh grad, so my elder relative told me that in the tech industry there are 3 tiers, the product companies, in-house shops and technical consulting shops. Technical consulting is the lowest tier, this is the dumping ground where the working hours and long and process is inefficient. In-house shop is the middle tier where organisations (can be in any industry) are trying to digitise their business so their hire in-house to keep cost down and develop their infra from the ground up. The product companies are the established start-ups and software companies like FANNG, this is the top tier and very hard to get in one. His advise to me as an NUS engineer switching to IT, is to avoid consulting firms unless I want to become a project manager or IT consultant or you hold an IS degree, doing a contract job in a in-house shop is much better and to slowly buy my way into a tech start-up. Is his advice sincere and correct? Just wanna confirm his intuition, thanks.

If you can't get a place in NUS CS mods due to their popularity, you can start small with a good introductory course like Harvard/edX's CS50, or the ones on Coursera/Udacity/MIT OpenCourseWare. I think if you commit to a full course with school, it may be a lot. So my suggestion is try one first, see if you like it, and go from there. 

In my undergrad years I only managed to take 6 CS mods, so when I landed a CS research job I had to take some online courses to immerse myself and catch up. Eventually I went on to do a CS Masters. So it's very possible! Jiayou! :)

3178,"I am the OP of #68663, responding to the comments suggesting that the CMB profiles I was referring to are fake. One Xu S Han, for instance, claimed that “CMB uses fake profiles to con carrots like you”. 

While I think there is some force in the claim that the profiles I had referred to in my earlier post are fake, I thought I should just highlight a couple of indicators that point strongly against that.

First, my friends and I had, in the past, matched with some of these bagels. These bagels in fact responded to our messages, at least in the first two days. They also typed in a colloquial, local manner. However, it usually became quickly obvious from their responses that they were not interested. 

Second, these bagels have, over time, updated their profiles, whether it be job title, descriptions, new photos and even the order of their photos. I am generally quite observant, and can remember these little details very easily.

Third, as some of these bagels are actually friends of my friends, I have incidentally chanced upon a few of their Facebook profiles (from group pictures and Facebook posts). Interestingly, the photos used in their CMB profiles are completely different from those they had uploaded on Facebook. Obviously, CMB could not have magically created these photos out of nowhere. They were not photoshopped. 

Fourth, and as absurd as this sounds, I think this is one of those situations where it is apt to use the phrase “you know it when you see it”. Feel free to disagree, but I think those of us who have used CMB will get my drift. 

Needless to say, I’m not suggesting that these permanent residents of CMB are doing anything wrong. Rather, the behaviour of these bagels is merely a reflection of a social phenomenon that has arisen with the advent of online dating (read my earlier post). 

On a final note, apart from the points raised in my earlier post, I think it is safe to say that for most of us using CMB, it becomes increasingly easy over time to sieve the chaff from the wheat.

3182,"I (M) started using CMB again recently, two years after I deleted my account. 

Out of curiosity, I scrolled through the profiles of the female bagels in the Discover section, with the option “Active within the last 72 hours” selected. 

Interestingly, I spotted many familiar-looking bagels who I had “liked” previously, two to three years ago. Most of them are at least a 7/10.

Initially, I thought that these girls might perhaps, like me, have returned to CMB (for various reasons) after staying away from it for a while. However, this notion quickly proved to be wrong when I started seeing more and more familiar faces.

To be sure, I showed some of the profiles to a few friends of mine who are active CMB users (more so than I am). My friends unanimously agreed that they had seen these same profiles for an extended period of time.

I cannot help but wonder why so many pleasant-looking girls have continued using CMB for such a long time. 

Is CMB really bereft of decent chaps, so much so that this has left them to become permanent CMB residents? Or are people just overly caught up in the illusion of “choice”, to the extent that they end up spending so much time men searching for the elusive “one”.

In any event, as someone who’s using CMB to find something serious, I know what to do when these familiar-looking profiles appear as suggested matches.

The rest of them knew each other for close to 1 year except me, I might know a few of them but they are more like hi bye friend in school and we don’t talk much at all.

So moving on, I noticed that the club president (let call him A) tend to talk to me more than others during our weekly training, and soon these talks involve some physical contact eg scaring me by laying his head on my shoulder or hugging me from behind. I understand he is trying to be friendly to me since im new to the team. One day, we were just joking around and I took his phone and accidentally saw his phone wallpaper, a pic of him and a girl (she is also part of the team, but she is busy with her internship so she does not come for training every week, let call her B). I pretend I didn’t saw it obviously. From then, I noticed that he does not have any physical contact with me when B is around, but only do so when B is not around. There were many times he will send me home after cca (I stay at amk but he stays in hall btw), and when I ask him why does he do that, he always say he just bored and just want to accompany me. As time passed, he started to find me more often, like waiting outside my lecture hall and going lunch & dinner together at least 3 times a week.

Then somehow I found out from his friends that A likes me that why he told the team that he wants me in the committee team. Ofc I continue act normal in front of him. And one day i went to a close friend’s hall to study together, and I saw A together with B and they are very intimated, holding hands etc. (A and B didn’t see me btw). I feel a sense of jealousy I guess I fall for him over time.

Every now and then when he is studying in the library, she will ask him to have lunch together. She will also like every single post that he shares on Facebook.
I feel that if I am the guy I will fall for her eventually because of the things she has done.

I have tried to gather thoughts from the girl about the guy. She says things like they have chemistry but she’s not ready yet. As she’s is a Christian, she says things like he is not of the same religion, therefore cannot. But her actions really say otherwise. 
I have also asked the guy about her and he says she’s is not his type. But he entertains her nonsense. when she’s aimlessly whining he will laugh and listen to her. Then he also mentions her sometimes  in conversations. 
I really don’t know know if they like each other or not and if they do, i would certainly like to back out early...

I know I should be doing this for myself, which I am too so I can hopefully find myself someone better and most importantly love myself better.

I am a Y1 freshmen and I found my university environment rather toxic and unhealthy. I befriended many people but usually they’re of the same type - self-centred. You may disagree with me as the university experience differs from person to person. However, I feel myself so disgusted by people sometimes that I don’t even want to come to school yo fake a smile in front of everybody. I heard from my Friend from NTU that people there are much nicer in general. HOW I WISH i can turn back time and I will reconsider my choice with NUS.

I could get out of a lot of things by saying ""something came up"" and most people would accept it but the truth is I just needed to be left alone. I just get these weird moments where I feel overwhelmed and just want it all to end...

But despite the occasional suicidal thoughts, low mood and absolute lack of motivation...I'm still passing through life pretty well. And I have been for the past 8 years? So it's really shocking to me when my younger brother came out and got diagnosed with depression.

Now I feel worse because I should have seen the signs that i myself once had. But even worse when I tried to bring it up he was so angry saying I shouldn't feign understanding because I wouldn't know what its like. And I don't. Not really.

And such coincidence that a few weeks after that post, people are deliberately setting fire to the Earth's lungs. For money. backed by the president.

The world will not get better. No amount of education will stop corrupt people from making such decisions, and forcing the world to bare the consequences. 

It was originally a post about having a child, but it seems that the general public just don't give a damn about this, because they are ultimately not the ones that will suffer, but our children,  and their children. It sickens me. The world is dying and there is nothing we can do about it.

3222,"Hi all, I'm 23M. I, too, think I'm above average looking (I do get asked out whilst in the office and even by various genders in camp, but no, I do not get harassed). To describe my intelligence in less identifiable terms, I scored 1600 on the SAT, and got 50/50 for the PI LI/CA I took for this summer's internship process. I'm an INTJ-A and I'd like to think that I handle myself well socially -- I'm usually the one pitching/presenting ideas and projects, and my promoter friends regularly ask me to help with their guest lists. I don't have the body of a Greek god but I gym often and get comfortable IPPT Golds. I also keep myself well-read and up to date with current affairs.

The thing is this: I’m evergreen. Though unlike olive oil, I’m green but not extra virgin. This fact seems to bother those around me more than it bothers me: Guys assert that I’m trying to live a playboy lifestyle (I do go out on a fair bit of dates, but I have never led anyone on if the feeling is not mutual; Sex only after consent and trust is established), and girls think that I’m lying. Not having social media accounts only furthers their beliefs. 

I simply do not feel that I’m missing out on life by not having a girlfriend. Admittedly, some counter that by claiming that I do not know what I’m supposed to miss out on in the first place. While that makes sense, I’m more affected by what my middle-aged friends say: “Find someone early before all the ‘good ones’ are taken and you end up with one of those being ‘left on the shelf’ ”.

Some time back, I had the opportunity of talking to a qualified professional on this matter. After we established that I’m neither doubting my sexuality nor having hormonal issues, the only advice he left with me was to “just give it time”.

What do you people think? Cast all standards and doubts aside to taste the fruit that is a ‘steady’ relationship? Get some relationship experience before the lack of it becomes a liability? Live my life as before?

He also keeps telling me how his friend went to the doctor and got diagnosed with cancer and died a few weeks later, like going to the doctor is some kind of curse.

It has allowed me to take criticism in my stride and differentiate between critics who care and pure haters.

How do I introduce myself.... hmmm I am a guy, 21 this year and I am insecure about my height. 

Growing up hasn't been easy for me. I was, and I still am the shortest among my peers. I was constantly picked on, laughed at yada yada yada. My current height is 1.62 metre tall. In the eyes of the society and majority of the women out there, I am nothing but a midget. I am not up to the society/majority of the women's perceived standard of a desired man. This is understandable. I mean women are attracted to tall guy right. HAHAHA girls shorter than me also desire for a guy who's 1.75-1.8m tall. Let's be frank here. I am really unattractive. No matter what kind of quality I have, or how good my personality is, or how confident I am, I am invisible. I am like a ghost and that's really depressing. You know how society and the media always portray that a woman and a tall man will lead to happy ending. Whereas for short guy, there is little to no coverage. In the mind of many women, shorty is probably at the last of the line. Society can accept that a woman is short and shrug her off as being cute. A short guy that is below the average is automatically classed as a midget. If you're a short guy, you're not taken seriously....

To top it off, I am not really that good looking either. I just completed a course of Isotretinoin for my raging acne. Right now, on and off, my pimples would resurfaced and there are a lot of scars. This is a matter that I believe that I can resolve; since there are abundant of scar removal treatment in Singapore. 

As for my height, the cost itself for a limb lengthening surgery puts me off; not to mention the downtime. 

I know how some of you will say, ""there's nothing you can do; you should just accept who you are"". To be honest, I tried. I really tried. I am full of confidence until another guy tower over me. I don't mind sacrificing 10 years of my life just to be tall. At one point in time, I got so depressed that I wanted to end everything. What's the point of trying so hard to be confident and stuffs while nobody give a damn about you. Sadly, height is a determining factor in everything. It determines your odds of getting a partner, it determines your career pathway and how other sees you. I am not making this up; this is what i experienced.

3239,"I feel like writing this down because I’ve seen too much information exchange going on between the students and the teachers on whispers about the fundamental programming modules. As a student who is at the end of the streamline and is about to become a finished product pushed to the job market, the posts reminded me of how I survived my first year of university here. And my reflection saddens me, not just because it is about a painful year, but more for a pre-mature me undergoing so much torture. Well, the torture indeed made me tougher and stronger (what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger lol), but I would appreciate it more if I was given more understanding and encouragement when I was deep in my struggle.

I remember the first lecture of my fundamental programming module gave me a blow right in my head. I just couldn’t get it when I heard “recursion/iteration is like induction, you just assume it works in the previous step, and it will work in the next step”. I became even more panicky when during the lesson right after the lecture, everyone else there seemed to know how to use recursion/iteration to solve the problems, as if their brains are dry sponges absorbing the knowledge instantaneously. I was so stunned when they solved the questions on the board with the things taught less than one hour ago, and even more stunned when there were people solving the questions using untaught techniques – for loops and while loops (these were some big wow to me because I never heard of them before…)! I just couldn’t understand how they got their solutions, or rather, why they are so freaking smart. I guess I looked too stunned. After a star student presented his answer, the teacher walked over, and asked me a question that I could finally understand. “You don’t understand anything, do you?” And with this question my stunned face was exposed to everyone in the room. Well, I really don’t understand anything, so I said, “no I don’t”. The teacher turned, and walked back to the board, “it’s ok, we are here to help you”. And there went more questions, and there went my totally shutdown brain.

That lesson ended at 3pm, and I went back home, sat down at my desk, and tried to figure out what the hell is recursion/iteration. It took me 10 hours to figure it out, and I remember the number of hours spent so clearly simply because I only left my chair at 1am with numb legs and a drained yet excited brain. It was really just what was taught, “recursion/iteration is like induction, you just assume it works in the previous step, and it will work in the next step”, but it took me 10 hours straight of thinking to absorb it. Now whenever I think of this experience, I am always so thankful that I figured it out just in time. I have seen people who didn’t try so hard and were left behind. I am thankful that it got the grit out of me, which would be necessary for me to survive the rest of my years in the university. But my practice is highly questionable, or rather, the motivation of my practice is highly questionable. What gave me the strength to think for 10 hours straight without eating, drinking or moving around? And why did I ask for help from my friends, when they seemed to understand the concept? I would say it was because of shame. I was afraid that people would say “it’s so easy, why don’t you just get it?” I was afraid to let other people know that I have become so “illiterate” and “dumb” when I used to be a top tier student. And I was afraid to get that question again, “you don’t understand anything, do you?”

And my shame was dismantled at the next lesson. The teacher gave us a question on the spot. He walked over to my desk (again), bent down, examined my solution, and then copied it to the board, “uhmmm, this looks pretty pedestrian.” I was stunned (again), because I didn’t know how to interpret the word “pedestrian”. Is it something like “路人甲” in Chinese (it means mundane and insignificant), or something else? And while I was thinking of the meaning of the word, a few of his favorite star students presented their solutions, “innovative”, as he branded them, but upon further scrutiny, failed. The teacher examined my solution on board again, “uhmmmm, seems like only the pedestrian way works.” I really felt like leaving the room at that instant. And that was the last time I appeared at his lesson. I thought, there is nothing to be shameful about. “Pedestrian” doesn’t mean I can’t win. I worked hard, I thought hard, and I got it right. If someone, especially an authority, brands me as “pedestrian”, gives me no faith from the start, the shame is not on me. 

The end of the story is not a fantastic one. I got B+ for this mod, and I had to S/U it. But does the B+ make me a less adequate programmer than a student who got A for this mod? No, as far as I can see, no. This mod is just about the fundamentals, the basics, the easiest things, of programming, and one day, it will become your second nature, just as easy as you speak and think in English. When I revised the material at the start at the next semester, I marveled at how stupid I was, why the hell did I spend 10 hours straight trying to figure out recursion, when it is just an induction??? But at the same time, I could still feel the pain of struggling and the fire of shame and anger that was burning inside me during those 10 hours. During these days when learning becomes a lot easier for me, I started reflecting on this experience. The most painful part for me of that mod was not the 30+ coding assignments, but the lack of faith in me, both by myself and by the teacher (at least that was how I felt). My confidence was shattered during that mod, and I tried so hard just to prove to whoever that I thought scorned upon me and gave up on me (well, myself included), that I can do it. I have to say it worked as a motivation, after all it got me learn how to work my ass off, but was it necessary for it to be so passive? Did I learn just for a proof of my capabilities, or for my future development, or for my interest, my passion? Does learning, especially for something that should be as easy as a second nature, have to be so painful? Would it be better if I had the courage to use more resources e.g. teachers friends families google etc.? Would I learn better if I didn’t get so angry to push myself to the dead-ends? 

There are so many what-ifs, but there is only one time that I undergo this process, and it shapes me to who I am now. I am thankful to this experience, but whenever I recall it, I really want to give a hug to the a-few-year-ago me, and let her know that things shouldn’t be so difficult, if it is, you are learning it the wrong way.

3242,"TL;DR: Taste bitter before sweet

Scenario A:

You fantasize about how happy your life is after your crush has agreed to go out on a date with you. You then ask your crush out for a date.

Outcome A: She accepts and you feel relieve

Outcome B: She rejects and you can't accept it.

Scenario B:

You understand that there is a chance that she might reject you. However, you are mentally prepared to accept this outcome and will bear the grief of rejection for a day, then move on with your life afterward

Outcome A: She accepts and you feel excited because you get more than you have expected

Outcome B: She rejects, but it is alright because you have already mentally prepared for it. At least you won’t have regret because you have tried.

It is quite obvious that scenario B is the ideal outcome at the latter stage. I know that you are trained to see thing from the optimistic point of view. However, you must also prepare for the worst-case scenario. Learn to taste bitter before sweet.

I couldn't get my core modules at first, and my appeal for one of those modules is still pending. Regarding tutorials, GEQ and GER were not allocated after round 1 and 2. I still have no idea why, there was no email to inform me of the outcome as well. Tbh I assumed that the allocation was delayed, like for the module allocation because edureg's status for these modules was TBA. Probably the system screwed up in round 1 and I still don't get why I didn't get my tutorial slot in round 2 if there were still vacancies left for my slot during add/drop/swap period at 9am. Furthermore, I added a tutorial during add/drop/swap [there were vacancies] and when I went back to check, the vacancies dropped to zero. I am quite shocked that there was no email to inform me that the add was unsuccessful. Honestly, it's disappointing to see a system that is incapable of handling the enrollment of modules and tutorials efficiently and accurately. I feel that there should be more transparency in how modules and tutorials are allocated. There are rumors about the system not following the priority score during module allocation. I hope that y'all will improve it at least to the standard of CORS because if not, there is no point changing the system.

3250,"Some time ago, I got into an argument with my father. Things got really bad and I eventually had no choice but to move out. At first, I found a place in hall, but hall activities take up way too much time. Eventually, after considering my options, I found a room for rent in a HDB flat in clementi.

Initially, the landlord was extremely nice to me. He would make breakfast for me in the morning, wait for me to put my laundry into the machine before washing our clothes together, and even drive me to school occasionally. We would also gym together. Eventually, we became good friends. 

However, over time, he began to act more and more like a ""father figure"". For example, he would start questioning me about my daily activities and try to control who I can or cannot go out with. He would also start nagging at me when I come home late. Note that this is the same ""pattern"" exhibited by my father in the past which led to our falling-out. 

The last straw occurred when I brought a tinder date home for the night. My landlord waited till my date left in the morning, then barged into my room while I was still half-naked, ripped off my blanket to wake me up and started scolding me. 

It has been a few days since that incident. I am not sure what to do now. On one hand, I feel that my relationship with my landlord is starting to turn toxic and it is probably time to move out. On the other hand, if I were to move out, I have nowhere to go. I dont want to be chased out of the house twice in a row. I also have the feeling that the current situation is just god's way of giving me a second chance:  I should try my best to repair the relationship with my landlord rather than repeat the same mistakes that led to the strained relationship with my father. All my life, my first instinct is to run away from toxic relationships. Maybe it is now time to change my mindset and learn to repair toxic relationships instead?

A lot is spent on student welfare, but I think what we also need to think of are the cleaner uncles and aunties who give us a clean environment to study and play in. It's quite sad to see most of the cleaners who have finished their work sit around for hours until 4pm (I'm not sure when they are allowed to leave, but I think it's 4pm?) As I am writing this, I can see one of the cleaners just sitting by the USC pillars, staring into space and just waiting for the time to go by. 

I know small things can be done as individuals like giving them snacks and greeting them in the morning when you see them, but perhaps we can do more as a school/organization. Some resources (read: money) can also be devoted to the cleaners, such as maybe giving them a room of their own to relax, watch TV in, read and just chat?

My chest basically looks like someone just punched my ribs and dented it. However, with my shirt on, I look perfectly normal and built due to my broad shoulders. Because of this condition, i used to avoid any activites that need me to take off my top. I have quite a low self esteem due to this and avoid getting into r/s for fear that girls will find it distasteful and break up with me after finding out about it.

Long story short, I met the love of my life (now my fiancè) through a friend. After dating for some time, we got together. However, i did not have the courage to tell her before we got together for fear of her rejecting me. I eventually decided to tell and show her my chest shortly after, to be fair to her. Shorter pain is better than longer pain. I am deeply touched when she didn't mind it at all and accepted me for who I am. 

We are now happily engaged and looking forward to our wedding and future together. Most importantly, I want to tell the OP that it is possible to find the one who will accept you and love you for the way you are and don't give up. Open up to the person you love and you will find that your bond with the other half will be stronger than ever.

Basically she complained on her university's confession page that she had to eat cup noodles for a month after spending all her money to buy her friend a present. She then complained that her friend didn't do so in return, and only gave her birthday wishes a couple of days late. She then labelled her as a fake friend. Everyone seems to be supportive of the confessor, telling her to cut off her fake friend.

Am I the only one who thinks that the confessor is the toxic one? When you buy a friend (or anyone) a present, you should not expect anything in return. All you should hope for is that he or she will like what you bought for her. This goes the same for relationships. When a guy buys a handbag for his girlfriend, should he expect her to reciprocate somehow? Maybe some of you do, but when I buy my girlfriend a cup or bubble tea, I expect no more than seeing her smile and enjoy her drink. Scale that up to a thousand dollar gift and the principles should stay the same.

TLDR: The real ""fake people"" are those who have hidden agendas in everything they do.

I am not sure but why is there a need for me to purchase a textbook for a module especially if that textbook costs 70 over dollars? Is school fees not enough? From the lecturer, I heard that this year he is going to use a new textbook and thus all the old textbooks are of no use. Furthermore, the PDF versions of the textbook are not available as this is the first edition of the textbook. Does anyone have the PDF version? The textbook name is ""Organizational Behaviour: An Asian Perspective"".

But more importantly,  I googled the authors of the textbook and they all seem to faculty members of NUS Business School. Is this even legal? I mean not all students can afford it right? I come from a family where we are not really eligible for subsidies but that is because my dad has to take care of his parents and and many of his siblings too because he is the oldest child and this does not really qualify for subsidies, so we aren't exactly well-off. But the lecturer using a textbook and then saying he is not going to webcast this lecture just does not make sense. Why must I pay additional money on top of my school fees for materials and resources for a module that I take. 

Plus no offence to business students, but this is known as a ""fluff"" module and it teaches very soft-skill kinda things ,so how exactly must these things have changed to use a completely new textbook? It is not like a discovery has been made which makes all the current teachings obsolete etc?

A little background on both of them. They are both working towards a healthcare related career. Their posts often centre on how much life sucks for them / how depressed they are / looking ugly or fat accompanied by a selfie (when they are really skinny and practically underweight) / humble bragging about their academic results. Other posts include their boyfriend / showing off the exciting things in their daily life.

I have kept a record of their stories for months, and I don't know why. Perhaps it is envy? I often wish I were in their shoes, my life is practically nonexistent. I may also harbour some resentment about how they don't appreciate their life when I'll trade mine in a heartbeat. Perhaps through their stories, I'm living their lives through them. Perhaps I feel slightly powerful knowing I have with me all their emotional times that were never meant to remain public.

It sucks to have your self esteem take a severe hit, to have been betrayed by the person you love, to feel at a lost as to what to do at this point in time when you still love the person so much. Will just like to share some advice based on my own learnings through this experience and things my counsellor has told me:

1) It is normal to feel like your life is in a mess, to feel that your partner doesnt deserve your love, and to feel unworthy. 

2) What your partner did has nothing to do with you. Your partner could have chosen to talk to you about the problems in your relationship or break up, but she chose to do otherwise - to put aside your feelings in order to fulfil her desires.

3) Talk to a counsellor if you have not done so. It can be hard to even take the first step to open up to someone to talk about it, but once you do, you'll be glad you did. 

4) To truly forgive, u need to stop yourself from judging your partner for her actions and to see her positive points. Be aware of how frequently you do so.

5) Ensure that your partner is willing to be a listening ear when you need to talk. Honestly the world can be here for you but the person whose support you need the most from is your partner.

6) You are brave for wanting to stay on to work on the relationship. Do not let the opinions of others get to you. Ultimately, it is your decision. It is not stupid to want to stay on. And if your partner does end up cheating again, do not blame yourself for it too. But also recognise that there is no guarantee in any relationship that your partner will be faithful forever.

7) While we may tend to google about similar experiences online or read forums to get different perspectives (hopefully positive ones), usually it makes you feel worse so do not be overly reliant on these readings.

8) Set time frames to monitor your progress.

9) Try your best not to think about the infidelity. I know sometimes it is beyond our control as these thoughts can randomly appear in our mind but try your best.

10) Most importantly, understand that you cannot go back in time and have to accept that this is the new normal. The new normal is not necessarily a bad thing if your relationship comes out stronger as a result of it.

Jiayou and i hope we'll find our answers soon! Create more happy memories and i hope these memories will remind you why this relationship is so special to the both of you.

Unfortunately, my initial euphoria quickly vanished after a few days on the job.  The firm that I interned at is prestigious and pays well, but I quickly realized that the job scope in my industry is not as glamorous as what is commonly portrayed in the media, the hours are long, the bosses are demanding and the office politics are just mind-blowingly bad. The only silver lining is that fulltime employees at the firm have it even worse. I cried to myself almost every day. I also started to seriously reconsider whether I really want to continue pursuing a career in this industry.

After discussing with my boyfriend, we decided that it would be good if I tried exploring other options. With his help, I was able to find an upmarket and classy social escort agency that was hiring new girls. The interview was held in an elegant hotel room and the working conditions looked good. They even provided TWG tea for me to drink! Overall I was quite impressed by the agency, so I signed up with them. 

At first, I was looking forward to my new part time job. Unfortunately, a few days in, I am unhappy again. My first client was younger than I expected (only 30 plus), but he was way too rough and hurt me. I was left crying by the end of the session and I had to call my boyfriend to the hotel room to comfort me. The subsequent clients were not much better. 

I am so confused now. I don't want to work in my industry anymore. I also don't want to work as a social escort anymore. I am already in my fourth year and it is probably too late to explore other career options. Should I try to do a masters in a different field?

I’m an underweight guy (19.5 BMI), so I have skinny arms and legs. But I have some abdominal fats. My stomach is getting a bit protruded. It’s definitely not as bad as those uncles you see in the coffee shop but I’m still quite concerned. 

I admit I don’t exercise or gym a lot. Also, I don’t watch out my diet because everyone say I’m skinny and ask me eat more, that’s why I just eat whatever I want. 

Anyone experiencing the same weird situation of low BMI but abdominal fat? I need advise on any dieting or working out tips on how to reduce abdominal fats, that’s my utmost concern.

My second priority is that I also want to become more buff and muscular. What advise you guys have for me? I scare if I eat a lot to buff up, they will just go to my abdomen again and not my arms and legs. 

Thanks in advice.

3291,"The purpose of study week is to consolidate learning and prep for exams, right? But some profs nowadays are labelling their exams as ""class tests"" for the sole sake of shifting the exams before study week. Why is that the case? The weightages of these tests might as well be an exam. I am personally taking 21 MCs this semester and I have 0 ""exams"" but all tests, so I'm worried I might not have enough time to study for all of them.

3293,"Had a friend in JC, we were kinda close and we'd just tell each other stories and stuff. She was going through a rough time one day with her boyfriend, mentioned that he'd hit her when they fought and whatnot. So as a good ""sister"" I advised her on stuff, and basically just was there for her throughout.

Didn't think it was my place to suggest they break up, but if and when she brought it up, I was there to objectively weigh out the options.

So recently they (finally) broke up, and think it became quite the debacle in our friend groups, even spilling out onto social media, Twitter and Insta and what-have-you. Nothing new, just them washing all those years of dirty laundry. Somehow I got dragged into it, and for some reason somehow I became the reason she even thought of breaking up.

I think - and know - that she's making me the scapegoat for this, and I don't like it one bit. She's pinning the entire thing on me, and I'm really just quite pissed off at this point since she's really trying hard to make it look like it's somehow my fault or my ""coercion""

Thing is, back in JC, she told me that one day after she and her boyfriend had argued, she'd hooked up with some other guy in school backstage - I'm inclined to ""help"" her ex by letting him know about this entire thing; she'll know it was me but at this point I don't really care.

I'm more concerned about the other guy in the story, because the real reason they broke up is something similar to this, and I don't think the other guy deserves what's probably coming to him by being dragged into the drama. He's personally one of my good friends too, and it's for that reason I haven't told anyone.

As far as I can tell, my friend and this other guy hasn't had any contact since we graduated about 5 years ago, and honestly I think she was just making use of him for her personal gain.

I'm still in some contact with him, and I think I should leave out his name from it, but I'm just worried that his identity might just come out eventually...

Don't know what to do, the leprechaun hats are strong with this one.

Some things feel so right but... just don't work out the way you hope it to. You come to a new point in your life; so much hope and wonder in your eyes, only to have them stripped from you. You're left feeling every trace of heat and life leave your body, and now... you're a cold, dead, girl walking.

I ask myself, why do I do these things to myself? Is this masochism? Is this selflessness?  Or maybe... I am just a selfish person who only thinks about what I want endgame. I hold on tightly to something; I try to fight for it. I want to believe that fighting for what I want will work. But slowly, I feel my hopes fade away. I feel myself getting pulled into the void. The same void I always get lost in.

Am I really deserving of these good things? Maybe things are better without me in the picture. All these situations, they always play out the same way. The only constant... is me. I am the cause.

You start to think you're worthless, even though you're worth so much. Lines get blurry and paradigms get fixed. How does one remain hopeful, when all the signs point to the same expected outcome? I feel my insides are about to pour out. I feel a part of my soul being ripped apart. I close my eyes and I see that dark silhouette, standing metres away. Red streaks spanning all around: the fractures.

It's my fault.

Don't you hate it? How temporary things can be? I know I do. It terrifies me too.

3295,"This is going to be a very long story
Friend A is my secondary friend and we have been friends for more than 6 years. For example: Picking up her call, meeting up in an unholy hour to chit-chat. Back then, I really appreciate her as a close friend and I am thankful that she will take up her time in the middle of the night to chat with me. 

As time goes by, meetups have become lesser due to her busy schedule. We only had frequents callings and she is usually whining about her workspace. I asked for her assistance for minor things such as referral codes. She rejected with reasonable reasons such as no apps. I understand that. Often, I asked her out. However, she rejected me with understandable reason. 

 Things started to go south when I was having financial difficulties. My family run into some problems and I asked her to borrow me some money. It is understandable if she is unwilling to borrow me $50-$100 as she might have difficulties and she does not earn much.

 I texted her again. I asked if she was willing to borrow me $20. She did not reply after constant texting. The next day, she went to the cafe which cost around $20. She was a full-timer. From that time onwards, she did not text me. I was hoping she asked about the condition of my house. I was disheartened.  Her actions have stabbed my heart.

It was all a test and I was lying about my financial difficulties. One thing for sure: I will lend her money if she needs $100. I will lend to her despite earning a penny. (part-time job)
It got me to think if she was just using me as a punchy bag/find me during her spare time.

We really just want to sell reps at low prices so that fellow sneakerheads and fashionistas can save money while keeping with the trend. I mean think about it, for the price of 4-5 reps, you can buy one original authentic (which is usually overpriced) product. It's called smart living.

Next, I was wondering, if you do sell reps, on which platform or where do you sell them on? How do you sell and what is the price range? Thanks for your help!

He enlisted in January and we maintained our relationship throughout his bmt period and after he's posted to his vocation. I've heard stories of ns breakups but I thought we could survive it. However, after I went to an orientation camp, one particular guy in my og caught my eye. He looks like an ah beng (I think he's hot, but this may just be my own opinion) but is actually evergreen, to my surprise. I've had an ex who was actually one, and he was abusive and manipulative for the few months we were together. I was too naive in secondary school and thought I could 'tame' his wild behaviour. After I broke up with him, in JC I got together with my current boyfriend who was the 'guai' type, focused on studies, no clubbing, drinking, gambling, whatever. I'm instantly attracted to his appearance and vibe, but pushed those thoughts to the back of my mind since I was attached. We talked during the camp, but didn't contact each other privately after camp. I can't stop thinking of him. When uni started, I hoped I could bump into him on campus. We did, he said hi and I said hi back and we went our separate ways, as we were in different courses in the same faculty. I don't think I'll call off my relationship, as I love my boyfriend a lot, but I'm not sure what to do with the obsession of my og mate.

I've (21F) been in a rs with this guy (21M) since JC2. And back then, before he got enlisted, I was rather extroverted, or should i say i was leaning towards the extroverted side of the scale. However, as i grew older, i realised that i really enjoy spending my time alone. I enjoy watching movies alone, studying alone, taking short walks/ bus rides/ grabbing home alone. Plus i take afternoon naps regularly these days. Its just my way of relieving stress.

Yet, my boyfriend doesnt seem to fancy my change and so, our rs has been going through some rough times ever since he ORDed. He mentioned that he doesnt feel like he is being needed and that i dont love him as much. But everytime i see him, i still feel happy and blessed just that it tires me whenever i need to interact with ppl/ go out for long hours. Even for friends, im also not the one who jio people out, i just wait for them to jio me, but it doesnt affect our friendship in any way. I also havent made any friends in my 2 years of uni, all of them are hi bye. Cant seem to find the energy and motivation to interact with others. Im quite satisfied with my current social circle.

Ive spoken to him before and already gave in by spending more time (having dates after school, allowing him to fetch me after school etc) as i feel like some of his points were valid.

How did you feel about your MSc and Ph.D. days? 

I am writing my Honors thesis and I feel both overwhelmed and enriching at the same time. I love studying more and have a great deal of curiosity for my field. However, I am not sure if I should do an MA is for me since I get overwhelmed on some occasions. 

(I'm from FASS :( )

Thank you so much for helping me.

3343,"I am going on SEP soon and upon return, I need to start my IA. At the time when I book my return flight ticket, the IA Official start date is not yet updated by the school so I tried guessing the start date to be the on the third week of Jan judging by the current IA start date. Less than 1 month to my SEP, I received an email informing students about IA start date which would be on the SECOND week of Jan. So I emailed the faculty to ask if the start date of IA could be postponed by a week and the faculty said that the school allows it.

Me being a very guai kid, I emailed my own department as well,asking to start my IA 1 week later while explaining the reason. However, the dept told me that I SHOULD have checked with the Dean's office if I cannot find it online (And yes, I do not know that.) Upon further pleading, the dept told me that *all students have to abide by the school rules.* (Word for word) (Btw, PLEASE send me the SCHOOL RULES)

I understand from seniors that the dept may do so due to insufficient number of profs going round for IA and now the dept wish to standardise all the official start and end dates for IA. However, I dont see why it is SO FREAKING HARD for the dept to allow me to postpone my start date to be 1 week later when the faculty allows for it BUT MY DEPT does not allow, like now (They allowed it for Sem 1 IA).

Since IA is more like between the student and the company itself, I am very frustrated that MY OWN DEPT is making things hard for me when the faculty says it can be done (Upon further confirmation, the faculty says *needs your dept approval*. Shouldn’t the school be helping the students in terms of need?

Its complicated. Love is like a triangle but an opened one. A girl likes me but i like another girl, however the girl i like is an INFJ and she's really nice to everyone, so i cant tell if she likes me. I dont think she does though, because we hardly have much interaction due to us taking different mods despite being in the same course. I talked to her once while going home and it feels like we're friends (after all we havent really talked one on one much, we mostly just say hi when we see each other around school)

I like her so much that it hurts to think about it and i dont think i can like anyone else. Truly, i feel bad for the girl who likes me, because i know if i hadn't met the 2nd girl, i would have accepted the 1st, we connect well and interact much more than me with the 2nd. But i cant stop thinking about the 2nd girl. The 2nd girl seems too busy with studies to bother about relationships

Both girls are the shy and independent kind and the first girl looks better than the 2nd. But im more attracted to the 2nd girl because of her intellect and personality, she's soft spoken, helpful and really smart. She's from one of the top 2 JCs and currently a first class honor student and does well at everything she does, also she does many things alone, although i seen her once or twice with a grp of people. In many ways we're alike, but i think she just sees me as a friend :( also im too shy to ask her or anything at the moment since we're not even close. 

I need help either

2. Finding out if the 2nd girl likes me

3345,"To OP of #68208, I went through similar situation as you. I dug and dug to know each and every explicit details of the cheating and got myself into a bout of emotional turmoil. I go bonkers at every single thing possibly linked to the other woman. Even after we got back together, for a good ten months, I kept repeating all these details in my head in chronological order, an attempt to numb myself to the details. Obviously that did not work out well. I just see myself falling deeper and deeper into a black hole, questioning why am I still stuck with this asshole? Things started turning for the better when i made the decision to NOT think about it (but ya, I know pink elephant theory) so I took things slow, one day at a time.
Some humble advise
1. As much as you may think she does not deserve it, love is after all a DECISION. So make the conscious decision to shower her with love and not expect it back.
2. Talk to her when you need to. Tell her when the thoughts get too overwhelming. If she is the one you intend to spend forever with, she needs to understand your thoughts. She needs to be there to help you heal. She broke your heart, she’d better help you fix it. If someone else can help you better, it just goes to show she is not the best for you, unless of course if you seek professional help then that’s a different story.
3. She may be upset when you tell her how you feel, but you will need to keep things transparent in the relationship. Don’t forget that part of what makes the you hurt is how she kept the cheating from you.

I am married for almost two years (three years post incident) And even now, I still think of what happened when doing mundane stuff. However, I am no longer negatively affected by it. I accepted that shit happened and how it made me a stronger person. Sounds like a happy ending? The journey to it is definitely not an easy one, but it’s doable. You are stronger than you think. All the best :)

You are able to meet them every week, going out together even on the late midnight and its a close group and not just a few of you. While on my side, I don't know why my section feels so weak. 

I always heard that people you met on BMT would be one of the closest people since it was the first stage of army life. But my section was so different. They quarrel among each other, there were a few outcasted because of their mindset and how they bring down the others. Personal things happen here and there. 

Why is my section just so different? In all honesty I feel like we are the only section that did not have a group photo... all we had among the 16 people, was just some scattered friendships here and there.

It is too late already considering that was a few years ago. But seeing how close you are with your BMT friends. Wow the amount of insecurity. I am so worried that you may leave me for your new friends.

But things haven't been working out for a while & are starting to catch up with me. (Am a current undergrad, just to set the context!) I've always been a quiet guy & never the outspoken type & i make a few friends here & there, but because of mistakes i've made, how uncaring & unthoughtful of a friend i've been, not being there at certain times, i find them slowly drifting apart from me. i believe i've gone through a short period of depression although i've never wanted to confirm with a healthcare professional & i don't wanna seem to jump on the bandwagon of mental illness, etc.

I feel like this depression has affected me severely & i can't mingle around with people like I used to, it's very difficult for me to initiate conversations & i just don't leave a lasting impression on anyone.

I see people on social media hanging out with friends & doing all this fun social stuff & i just feel so down. No one really reaches out to me via text & i know i should not always sit on my bum & wait for others to text me & yeah, i've been trying to get out of this hole i got into & socialise more & more & things have been picking up a bit. 

God knows how painful this whole process has been for me & i don't have a partner to confide in, i don't always want to rely on my parents because they're getting really old & i just don't want to worry them anymore. It breaks my heart seeing them not the way they were before, age is catching up with them. I'll keep trying my best but there's so much on my plate right now I feel :( 

Just glad I have a platform to pen my thoughts, wishing you guys the best & thank you for taking the time to read this :)

3359,"Dear Prof Ben,

My friend threw me this question so now i will like to forward his question to you instead.

My friend and i were both from the same JC. However, he didnt do well enough in A levels to secure a place in local uni. Therefore, he took the unconventional path of going back to poly after NS due to financial constraints.Back then, his aim was to just make it into a local uni.

Fast forward 2 years later, he is now on his final year internship before he graduates. With his current grades, he can easily get in to a lot of courses in any local uni.

However, he is already 24. He thinks that by going to uni for another 3-4 years, he will be lacking the working experience to apply for a job. Also, applying for a job at the age of 28-29 years old with no relevant full time working experience may also put him at a disadvantage as compared to others.

So Prof Ben, with your experience in life so far, do you think my friend should just apply for a job once he comes out of poly, or should he go forward with his education in a local uni if he has a chance to?

I am currently 26-year-old, who has graduated from a not so well known Uni in the UK and have been working as a trader for the past couple of years or so and I would like to switch to medicine.

I have been volunteering a fair bit over time in various hospitals and departments and I am constantly in awe in what doctors/medical professionals can do, and also, I do not want others to re-live what I had to go through: being helpless with a loved one.

Currently, I have only one option as DUKE-NUS does not recognize my degree + I do not have any research experience.

And PCP is also out as I do not have a science-related diploma to switch over to another healthcare-related program.

This would be my plan but it is going to take a long time without any guarantees.

- Go back to polytechnic and take up a Biomedical/ Nursing course (i did not do that fantastically in poly due to a lot of distractions) - however, I think I can focus now as I do really want to succeed in the said field.

- Hopefully, score well and continue to volunteer as I enjoy it as well as for the exposure during my time in poly and apply to YLL or LKC.

I do have a couple of concerns though,

1. Do YLL take in students of such age ( I will be around 30 by the time I complete poly)

2. Funding: other than scholarships, I am not sure whether there are alternative ways to fund my education through.

I understand it is a long route hence would like to seek some opinion and/or advice, before committing to it.

3368,"I am a current NUS undergraduate dating an older, married man. Lets call him Jerry (Not his real name). I would like to take this opportunity to address some misconceptions that many people here on NUSWhispers have regarding girls in my situation. 

1. Love

I love Jerry. I really do. In an alternate universe where Jerry was a NUS student, I would hunt him down during orientation, hold his hands and never let go for the rest of my life. Jerry is kind, sweet, intelligent and wise. I love it that no matter what problem I may encounter in my daily life, I know I can count on Jerry to provide me with a fresh perspective and good solutions. Girls on NUSWhispers: Imagine having your own personal Prof Ben who is available 24/7 to answer any of your questions and do naughty stuff with you. Doesn't that sound super romantic?

2. Money

Ours is not a sugar relationship. When we met, I didn't know that he was rich: All I knew when we first met was that he was on vacation with a naggy wife who didn't know how to appreciate the historical significance of the place we were visiting, and I was likewise on vacation with an immature ex-bf who was married to his iphone games.  

Now let us address the elephant in the room: the issue of money. I have two confessions to make. First, I admit that I find successful men attractive. Second, I admit that while I do not receive any monthly allowance or credit cards, I do receive gifts of jewellery, clothes, handbags, etc. As a matter of principle, I never check the value of the gifts I am given. However, based on common sense, I would estimate their value to be no less than the equivalent of $5k monthly as quoted in the previous confession. 

However, before you judge me, consider this:

A. Self-made rich people tend to be smart, driven, attentive to detail and have nonzero communication skills. These are all extremely desirable traits in a boyfriend. At the very beginning, if I am to be brutally honest with myself, maybe I was indeed attracted by Jerry's money. However, as we spent more time together and slowly accumulated the usual emotional baggage present in every relationship, it is ultimately Jerry's personality, not his money, that keeps me devoted to him.

B. My ex receives a monthly allowance from his parents of approximately $500 a month, of which approximately $50-$100 is spent on me. Jerry's monthly remuneration is a six digit figure, so $5k a month is not unreasonable. In fact, if you do the math, I am probably slightly underpaid in this relationship... 

3. The wife problem

I am probably unique because I have actually seen and interacted with the wife before. Overall, I think that apart from her constant nagging and lack of cultural awareness, she seems reasonably attractive and any guy would be lucky to have her. I do not hate her, neither do I love her. Sometimes, when Jerry has to cancel on me due to some family appointment, a terrible rage boils up within me and I think of doing evil things to her. Yet, these moments of rage are balanced by the quiet, introspective moments in the middle of a boring lecture where I pity her for her ignorance and feel guilty for being the ""homewrecker"" in her marriage. 

To be honest, I am not really sure where our relationship is headed right now. I love Jerry very much and want to marry him sometime in the future, yet I don't really want to see his wife's large stupid eyes filling up with tears. I also don't really want to be a stepmother to their children. A few months ago, Jerry brought up the possibility of divorce and we discussed it seriously. Unfortunately, Jerry's wife got pregnant again so our plans are temporarily on hold. We have not discussed this issue since then. 

For now, my relationship with Jerry is my beautiful secret: neither my family nor my friends in NUS know about this. I love Jerry very much. Perhaps the OP of 68088 is right and the best thing for me to do in my situation is to screw society and enjoy the happiness that I found in an unexpected place...

3371,"My girlfriend cheated on me during her exchange, having sex with a random guy and travelling all over the continent with him all while I was deluded into thinking that she was focusing on her studies. I eventually found out but chose to forgive her after months of quarrels, and she seemed remorseful and eager to change for the better. 

Choosing to stay together with her was a ridiculously painful choice, like someone was constantly shoving shards of glass into my heart. Every new loving memory crafted with her was clouded by the painful remnants from being treated like a plaything. While doing mundane things like brushing my teeth or commuting on the train, my brain would suddenly be flooded with memories of what happened back then, and I would be overcome with emotion and just break down. A very sorry sight to see on the train indeed. 

My emotional health is in pieces... But I still love her. I really do. I believe that I am willing to die for her. There are moments when everything seem to be back to normal, back to the days before she indulged in adultery and we were just a young couple in love. The illusion fades away as quickly as it blossoms. These emotional scars will probably never fully heal as long as we are still together.

But yet I do not want to leave her. I know that I’ve been majorly cucked, but I do not want to leave her even though I am in so much pain. A war rages on inside me between logic and emotion. A pyrrhic victory is the only possible outcome.

Dear NUSWhispers, have any of you stayed together despite your partner cheating on you? How did you deal with it? Are you still happy now?

3373,"What makes a “good” prof or a “bad” prof?

Taking this module a heard a few classmates complaining that they’ve heard from seniors about how “bad” this prof is at teaching. 

As I proved further, the reasons cited were that he doesn’t provide past year papers, doesn’t give guidelines on what’s gonna be tested and what’s not, and lastly sets exam questions that completely catches everyone off guard. And so these students think that he’s “bad” because, well, he doesn’t prepare us sufficiently for the exams. 

Yet this is exactly why I feel he’s great - this should be how modules are taught. 

Too often students are overly concerned about taking exams and neglecting the true purpose of learning. Guess what, when you start working, there’s no “right” answer - more often than not, the projects you work on are open ended, and it’s up to you to discern the relevant information and come up with solutions. Nobody’s gonna hold your hand and guide you along, telling you exactly what you should do. 

And that’s why I feel all profs should be like this. Because that would be fair to everyone: no hints, no narrowing down of chapters, no practice papers, and lastly, the format of the questions can catch you completely off guard. Because this would be true learning, a test of whether you’ve understood the concepts, rather that just studying for an exam. And this mirrors the real world more closely, where things are dynamic and unpredictable. 

What do you think?

P.S. I’m someone who leaves it to reading week before starting to study, and thus far I’ve been getting by with decent grades which I’m satisfied with (high Second Upper).

Have been trying to build up friendships with people but it always doesn't goes well or ended up with bad notes.

I had joined as committee and members in CCAs during poly but none of the friendship were long lasting. Partly due to openness in people, could be too overwhelming to see others going crazy and have tons of fun while I do not know where their energy comes from. I could not bring myself up to the crowd and big group of people. Besides, many just come and goes in your life.

Some of them would den share about how their friend/relative/ spouse are doing well in that profession 

So I would tell them that I didn't like the shift work, or the fast pace environment. 

Little do they know the real reason. In fact even my parents dun know e real reason.  I was molested when I was younger. 

I didnt know that I was that affected though. I was still able to hang out and talk to the opposite gender alone.

Yet I didn't know the experience affected me that much. I was able to survive e first two years. When I was in the male ward I would be showering the patients with a staff. 

Once I had to sponge a patient with the sister because the ward was so busy and severely short handed. I stood in the cubical with the trolley and suddenly I froze. 

The sister got irritated and berated me. Looking back I think being in the cubical alone with e half naked pt brought back memories and I was going through a lot of family issues at that time and didn’t really had an adult to talk to about it.

I dun know why I’m even sharing this on such a platform, but I just wanna say that there are more than what’s meet the eye. 

And to all medical professional please do not disregard your students/colleagues by calling them names. The environment and having to deal with sick patients is stressful enough and doesn’t not need other factors to add to the toxicity.

3385,"Thank you everyone. I am #68005, I posted a few days ago about my failed relationship (https://www.NUSWhispers.com/confession/68005)

After growing with him for so many years, the perspective and even priorities really changes. We went through thick and thin, and I never regret all these past years because I truly cherish and treasure all the times we had together.

What I need is not money, a humble lonely woman does not need that much money other than the basic necessities. They may give materialistic happiness, but so what? For the young people, try to ask your parents what do they really want. All they want is the family to be together, to watch their children grow up healthily and fulfill their ambitions.

Retirement? Travelling around the world and ‘enjoy life’? Able to do what I ‘want’? I spend my whole life taking care and bringing out the best in him. I supported him in every way I can. In all honesty, all I know was to love him and make him ‘happy’. So right now with his departure, I am just dazed and confused. It is not the past that scares me, it is the future without him that terrifies me.

At this point of time, my biggest regret was not having a child with him in respect with his wishes. I never pushed for it, because it was simply seen as ‘responsibilities’ to him. This was my biggest downfall, the worst mistake of my life. If only I had done otherwise, I would have a part of him to live with me for the rest of my life. This was the best ‘insurance’ because I would be able to love and care for him. I regret it so much.

What I find hardest to cope, was that she could do or say anything to me and I am completely powerless because I had lost everything, the man I loved so much, too much. It felt like a tight slap across my face, that there is no right or wrong. He did not say or do anything, I guess I could not expect anything. How can I even compare myself to those young women so much younger than me? I do not really think there is anything I can do to reverse my age..

Even if I manage to get a huge sum of money, what can it do? Overall, I am still the biggest loser leaving with nothing while she walks away with him. Family broken up, youth and time all wasted. Now abandoned and deserted at such a prime age. Money really only can do that much.

Yes, I chose this person. All he can say now is “I am not a good person”.

I guess after writing all of this, I just hope that I am still able to keep in touch with him, to know how he is doing (although I doubt I can stay by his side anymore). He did not really express much thoughts on this, but I am worried. I am very worried that the other women may force him to cut off all ties with me. Right now, she has the power and position. I really fear her.

I need him

Depression really changes you as a person. After 2 years, I did make changes for myself. Such as by trying to lose weight and being more social, getting out of my comfort zone. I never really had friends in secondary school, and in college, I met the best people in my life. Really good people and they are my friends. However my friends are all of different ages and they all have different priorities in life and I acknowledge that. Now it seems like all my friends are busy, and spend whatever free time they have with their gf’s/bf, we haven’t met up  in 5 months now. 

In a couple of weeks, I’m gonna turn 18. All my friends are either overseas or busy with work. I don’t really want to celebrate with family as I actually wanted to hang out and enjoy my day as an 18 year old with my friends. I don’t think I’ll be having a birthday celebration with my family either, probably just cake. 

My plans on my birthday is to just go out alone and watch Football, treat myself to a nice meal and probably get some drinks, but doing this all alone. 

Everything about me has changed. My taste in fashion, view on certain stuff, my likings such as football and even my career prospects. I try to wear more fashionable clothes now, I stopped supporting my favourite team for the last 10 years and now I started supporting a mid table club. I was interested in my field of study but now I want to do something else, like business. 

It just feels like I’m finally being me but I’m 
so different now. I do appreciate that I’m changing but it’s like I can’t accept that I’m actually being ok in life, like being down was always my path and now that I’m not down anymore, I’m a little lost per say. 

Are my feelings justified ? That I’m slightly disappointed that my friends can’t make time for me when I would do so for them (even though I’m working too) and also about feeling different about myself ?

May I ask what does it take to be selected for valedictorian?

I know this is an awkward question, but please don't get me wrong, I'm not asking just to paper chase my way to becoming a valedictorian, I'm just a freshman trying to find my way in life. I find uni can be confusing - many people have many different views and goals for their uni life. I just want a fresh start, to start my uni life on the right foot. I want to set my goals right and work hard towards them. But before I can, I think it would be helpful to know what to work towards also. 

I sense that you're a prof who has a wealth of life experience and who is willing to help students, thought perhaps it will be a good idea to ask you.

I figured perhaps by asking this question I could get a sense of what qualities an ""ideal person"" should have. 

If it's not possible to share the exact selection criteria for valedictorian here, could you perhaps share your views on what you would advise a student to develop in terms of (soft) skills, character, attributes that could help them go far in life? What advice would you give to a freshman just entering university?

I know that it was ended up with a very bad condition where I didn’t even talk to him at all. And I don’t know whether he is bi or what, but to be honest, there is no such friend would do extra miles like the normal couple did. But in the end, he never admit it to me at all.

Sometimes, the feeling of guilt dominates my thought where I am always feel that I disturb his time and breaching his space despite he is the one did it most of the time after the confession. But truthfully, there is no single anguish came out from him except for copious cursatives he said unto me which is normal to me.

I love being together with him and I don’t need him to do alot of extra miles for me, just being himself present in front of me should be enough. But now, his presence makes me more angry even though he was not in the same dept as mine since I transferred out, because for all the things that he did to me which was ended up so badly. 

Perhaps there is abit of anguish came out from my own self due to all the things that happened between us, but my love for him never fade. That is the one last thing I told him before I transferred out from my old dept, I told him that I loved him. I walked away with a heavy feelings, looking at his glistening eyes that tells his own unspeakable mixed reaction. He knows that I loved him and he did loved me but only as a good friend (or perhaps, he didn’t want to admit it to me).

I don’t know whether you will read this or not, but I hope you are okay outside there. Please take care of yourself and hope you are always be happy. I still love you and perhaps in few years again once you got married, that will be the time I will stop loving you.

I met girl A when we were both penniless students in NUS. I was the nerd with thick glasses, and she was the happy-go-lucky girl with a smile always on her face. We studied together, ate together, went for lectures together. We were inseparable. We were soulmates. I would write poems for her, and she would feed me the cookies she made herself. After graduation, we decided that it was easier to write poems and bake cookies for each other if we lived together, and so we got married. 

Today, 10 years later, things are very different. The smiley-faced girl that I married now only has dollar signs in her eyes. I didn't know it when we were still dating in uni, but girl A is actually extremely stingy and mean. Girl A also spends most of her time causing trouble with other housewives and rarely spends time with me or the kids. In her free time, her favorite hobby is finding fault with me and starting unnecessary quarrels for no reason. There are no more poems or cookies. She claims that she dosen't have time to bake cookies, but I recently found out that she had the time to amass a secret stock portfolio bought using my money. Frankly speaking, if I had the wisdom to sign a prenup, I would have divorced her long ago.

I met girl B when I gave an invited talk at her school. She emailed me soon after for advice regarding uni choices for a future career in my line of work. At first, due to my bad experience with girl A, I assumed that girl B had dollar signs in her eyes as well and decided to just treat her as a casual fling. However, on our first night together, I was surprised that she showed up at the room with a teddy bear from home: Apparently, she was very attached to that bear and couldn't sleep without it. That was when I realized that she was actually a really kind and gentle girl, and all my fears and apprehensions melted away that night. After a few wonderful nights together, I became her teddy bear and she is now only willing to sleep with my arms around her. Till today, I sometimes get texts from her in the middle of the night, complaining that she has trouble falling asleep without me.

All the while, unlike girl A, girl B never once got into any arguments with me about money. When I brought girl B along with me for a business trip, I didn't want my secretary to know about our relationship, so I gave girl B her own supp card for her to handle the usual logistics. Based on my bad experience with girl A, I was expecting girl B to max out the card by the end of the trip. I was right: girl B did indeed max out the card, but she spent the money not on herself but on me: Apparently, she saw that my suit was old and worn out, so she secretly took my measurements while I was asleep and arranged for a new suit to be made. When we returned to Singapore, I trusted her and let her continue using the card. Even today, as the new NUS term begins, girl B continues to take time off her busy schedule to spend time with me, and we are creating wonderful memories together every day, every moment. 

Dear reader, if you are still with me, I have a confession to make: I am actually the author of post number 67924. Please be my judge: If you were in my shoes, which relationship would you cherish more: the relationship with girl A, or the relationship with girl B? Society seems to think that one of these relationships is more legitimate than the other, but as I drift off to sleep beside with a girl who hugs me the way she hugs her teddy bear, I imagine that maybe society is wrong for once and that happiness can be found in unexpected places.

3438,"Girls sleeping casually around/ non virgin girls are akin to guys who smoke. There are many similarities:
1. Both are generally frowned upon by people privately but they have to pretend these acts are ok when talking about it in public setting to appear socially acceptable and non judgmental. 

2. Multiple studies have shown that smoking is linked to many health problems (eg. lung cancer) while fwb, casual sex and non virgin are linked to promiscuity. Number of sex partners is also linked to higher divorce rate. Go google scholar to search if you don’t believe. 

3. Whenever people say smoking or non virgin is bad and quote studies as evidence, smoker and non virgin girls will be defensive. Smokers will say not all smokers develop health problems, some even outlived their non-smoker. Smoking is a risk factor and not a cause. Non virgin girls will say different people are different, have different personality etc. Promiscuity and higher divorce rate is a correlation, not causation.

Basically, these people like to play the “don’t generalize” card to defend their point. I’m just wondering where did they find the confidence to assert that they are all outliers such that the findings from the studies don’t apply to them. 

Basically, I know girls dislike guys who smoke. My point of drawing parallel between smoker guys and non virgin girls is to provide a new perspective to girls and hopefully realize why non virgins are frowned upon.

3442,"Hey everyone. Its my first time I have been confessing here. I wanted to share my failed love story where it affected me alot honestly. 

It is all started when I was working and on that day there are a group of students been interned to our dept. Usually I am like-I-care person and just doing my job over and over again. Until one day, I was having some issue on job and on of the guy intern helping solving the issue. I was so thankful to him but as I say, I just continue my work as usual.

But this guy ah, keep on talking to me but of course he kept introduced himself to me and we exchange numbers after. It was my first time even since I started working, I am contacting some intern student. So we messaged and call each other quite frequent. We hang out alot as well. Got one day when we hangout tgt, I asked him whether he got gf or not and he said he did, so there goes my hope. Haha. Until the day of his last internship, I was abit sad lorrr. Aftr that, I didnt contact him anymore. 

Until half a yr after, I saw he came back to our dept with a shirt and semi formal wear, I was abit shocked. He came to me and said he’s been accepted to work in same dept as me. And I was like “oh shit, there goes my love life”. So we started to contact each other again and he vid called me almost every night up to 5 hours! I was abit weird that why would he spent his time on me as he himself got a gf. So i asked him direct “how are you and your gf?”

He said “we broke up already straight after we finished school”. And i was like “Damn!”

I didnt even know how to say but we went for a meal quite a lot, we went to watch movie quite frequent, not to forget the couple seat. I dun even know whether he liked me back or not but all he did to me is like someone the couple did. But I dont want to think alot about as I prefer the latter to initiate the move. So at one point of time during christmas, we were asking each other what we want for christmas and apparently he said he wants me for his christmas and suddenly he act cute after. I said to him to stop it because he is meddling with my feelings. 

In the end, i told him that i liked him and i loved him. And that is where all the awkwardness started. I started to avoid myself from him and started to stop texting to him. After that he started to contact me again and started to talk with me again. We do the same routine over and over again, without thinking on that day. He never said anything about the day i confessed to him because i dun want it affect our relationship at work. 

Months by months passed, our relationship worsen and we argued alot on the phone. I didnt even talked to him during work. Only after 2 years of knowing each other, we did a closure tgt which was failed miserably. In the he told me he dont like me and only treated me as a friend. And what kind of friend who called me up for hours and bring me for a meal secretly without ppl in our workplace knowing about it.

In the end, I ended up requested to transferred out from my old dept and move to the new one for the sake of my own self to be happy during work without presence of him. Honestly I gave up alot of things to make myself happy again. But out of all things, I would never forget what he told me after all he did: He dont like me because I am a guy too.

3445,"I'm not remotely involved in orientation and have never been an ogl, but I think it's honestly terrible how all university students are painted with a broad brush like kindergarten kids in much of the media, especially with the recent post about NTU's orientation. I know there are those who may say it's just NTU's turn to get grilled and it's not our problem, but in my view not only is there nothing for us to gloat about, but it is in our best interest to have their back.

Some stuff is inappropriate, and I'm all in favour of education such as classes raising awareness about sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour, especially over what has happened over the past few months.

Just look at the comments section in any article talking about orientation, and so some are asking for it to be scrapped altogether just because of a few bad actors. We are regressing into a path of no return. Let's be clear, when you have 30k+ people, sometimes there are bad apples, but collective punishment and the restriction of freedom should not be the solution just because it's easier for someone to go to that podium or newspaper and say ""We did something."" True, decisive measures need to be taken because they are so overdue, but this doesn't mean you rush through without considering if these measures really tackle the root causes. If they don't, you're just complicit in letting nasty things continue to happen in the future.

Everyone needs to realise the freedoms to behave like young adults must never be taken for granted. If we hand over the argument to the keyboard warriors about orientation today, it will be the beginning of the end of whatever limited freedoms we have today and we'll be on the road to turning Singapore universities no different from regimented military camps, which is not going to be pleasant as I can attest first-hand.

PGPR is not a representation of Singapore or NUS. I’m a archi student and I can confidently say that there wasn’t much thought process when they constructing this place. It’s poorly designed in so many ways. It’s a maze here - a new person can never find their room, bedrooms are poorly ventilated - always smelly when you check-in, bedroom’s thin walls seep water when it rains, bedroom windows are not too many and poorly designed, no handicap accessibility at the drop-off point, or even luggage friendly - student need to carry luggage down unless they miraculously find their way to the basement carpark and then take a lift up to mgmt office, toilets are crappy - looks like old part of vietnam, the function rooms are in the basement with no windows (always have a smell), MPH is also in the basement with no accessibility for the disabled, and when it rains you can’t get to the MPH - I almost fell once  avoiding the rain. Has the Senior Mgmt visited PGPR unofficially or always hosted to the best spots? Our Campus Infrastructure department headed by Prof Yong Kwet Yew, has he seen his product? Ask him to come down by himself and find Blk 21 and then also enter a Type C room and stay there for a night. I see the poor maintenance and housekeepers repairing & cleaning all the time but the fact remains that infrastructure plays an important part. PGPR is like an old 50 year old beat up car that the mgmt expects the mechanics to keep washing and servicing while expecting it to perform like a 5 year old car? And the poor staff always have to work hard just to explain the condition of the estate. I mean to be fair, there are renovation plans but it’s 2019. It’s taking a TOP University so long just to realise their mistake and renovate so late? Home is where the heart is and OHS says “creating homes on campus”. This is by far the worst home and those responsible for building such an infrastructure should not be working here. An inquiry should be setup for the team who approved this design. There are many shortfalls in the construction. Renovation can rejuvenate the place but it doesn’t excuse those who build such a poor residence.

Some background: I bought a jumbo pack of condoms and put it in my GF's place. Usually, while waiting for her to shower up, I would manually count the number of remaining condoms to make sure that she isn't cheating on me. Usually, the numbers tally up. Sometimes there is a small discrepancy, but then again I am not a math major so I give her the benefit of the doubt. 

It has been two weeks since I last went to her place. Yesterday afternoon, I was shocked to find out that there were 6 condoms missing. This is not a small discrepancy. I don't know which feels worse: The thought that she did it with 6 guys 1 time each, or the thought that she did it with 1 guy 6 times. I feel so hurt and confused right now. Apart from this incident, the rest of our relationship seems relatively normal, although on hindsight there were maybe some other warning signs that I was too blur to catch.

Should I confront her about the missing condoms? Surely there can be no other explanation right...

3465,"Why do girls think guys should make the first move, and if they don’t, get a stamp on the face smack center that “guys r really dumb- giving subtle hints like crazy also dun get it”? Do guys deserve such short sighted judgement, if you think of all the teasing sg gals pepper on guys? 

Consider the following scenarios. Tell me why this would mean it is a hint for the guy to confess since gal is interested. 

1. Gal chats with guy everyday. Have lunch, meet for movies and find nice places to eat. Meets on weekend, even goes to ECP. 
2. Gal drops by abruptly out of nowhere, say hi and infront of ppl she dunno, she suddently squeeze into the coffee table to do small chats with that guy only, literally kicks all other convo with his friend out of the window and it is all about her feelings, then abruptly say she buy and leaves - but after presentinf little gifts for him- but not handmade. Same Gal tell the guy lets go watch a movie together in front of everyone but takes 100 messages just to pin down a day for the movie, which turns into a breakfast lunch dinner movie time that gets cancelled several times with more apologies and more small gifts. 
3. Gal makes handmade cookies and gives guy regularly. Many times the cookies are heart shaped. She does not appear to cook specifically for the guy, but gives the impression she does. She seems not to realise that it is possible to peek into her bag when she takes out her cookies to see more cookies in there, nicely wrapped. 
4. Gal calls up guy for lunch almost every day, but cancels regularly, saying got this guy with Ferrari want to buy her lunch, but he keep canceling. 
5. Gal who regularly meet for lunch suddenly confides about how her finances are in trouble because an “unknown” sponsor only gives her $1,000 a month and she cannot afford to go on studying like that and was wondering if the guy can chip in another $1,000. 
6. Gal sees guy in a bus stop opposite, walk over just to say hi, small chats and even takes the bus to an MRT in the opposite direction saying she got time. But till now still haven’t exchanged numbers. 

Well let me tell you: NONE of these girls are dropping hints to start a relationship. They are just trying out stunts to see if they can elicit some kinda response from a guy, anywhere from “hey, can I meet you again” to “baby, I can’t stop time but I can stop you from leaving”, only to shove a power move called *WTF-blush-and-nevertalktomeagain-kthxbye,next* move. 

So what does guy do? “Well that was fun. Another time. Cheers!” ... and maybe she will msg again, maybe not. 

I know how this works because... not to be flexing but I always had girls lining up to pick from, but I know they are all just doing their 어장관리. I am fine with that. Having lunch with nicely dolled up gals is always a better deal than eating alone. 

Let me lazer in here for the guys on how to know yr gal got some feeling. 

Here is the thing: money talks. If a girls buys the meal, she is interested in you, and if u want to confess, she may or may not reject but she won’t do a ego trip on power play to hurt you, and the friendship can continue as if the confession did not happen (but dun ever confess again, although she will confess if she wants later on, maybe long after). Reason being that gals will NEVER spend money on a guy who they have zero feelings for. You cannot guilt trip a gal to spend money on you. She will spend money on you because she likes you. Maybe not enough to start a relationship possibly, but definitely enough to care for your ego being broken if you confess. If she writes love poem or make handmade origami with something written in it and lots of heart sign, that is not hint alr its confession hor, even if the content is only abt the weather or poem like “mice loves rice like I love u”. 

Ah yes, I forgot. If you don’t have girls lining up to have lunch with you, please ignore this post and study hard for level 1 pak-tor modules, this is level 4 module tips on choosing girl to BTO. 

Btw just to clear the air on getting a BTO: if u r from a really rich family, u will be forced to get a HDB by yr parents so as to learn to live humbly AND so that money does not poison their grand children or yr wife. So stop being so shallow and write off everyone in HDB as ppl who can’t afford condos. I could pay the downpayment for a condo just by saving up my allowance for a couple of months. Yeah I take bus 95 like the rest of you and don’t waste money on depreciating asset like cars even when I can afford an X5, because having money to burn does not mean you should burn it.

3467,"Imagine this: Your first date last night went well. The two of you began the date as strangers, but left holding hands like a couple on honeymoon. Perhaps the two of you went on to do other things typical of couples on honeymoon, things which the said couple will only begin to regret some nine months later. Its ok: We are a judgement-free community here at NUSWhispers. Whatever happened last night, it is a new morning now, which means it is time to plan for the next date! 

Resist the urge to text back immediately. From previous posts on NUSWhispers, you should be familiar the secret of baby powder and friendship bracelets. Don't let the beeping of his phone spoil the magic moment as your guy wakes up drunk on the strangely familiar yet intoxicating scent of baby powder and the lingering memory of your smooth and supple hands gliding up and down and up and down and up and down... your friendship bracelet. Give him time. He will text you first. 

While you wait for the guy to text back, I recommend that you ransack your cupboard/storeroom for an important yet underappreciated item: the JC hoodie. Poly and Uni hoodies are NOT an acceptable substitute. What to do with the JC Hoodie follows many of the principles set out in the baby powder and friendship bracelet posts. 

1. Recall that baby powder seeks to subconsciously evoke the image of babies and hence babymaking.  In a similar manner, the JC hoodie seeks to subconsciously evoke the memory of your date's first (serious) crush. At this stage, you have no idea whether your date's crush is the school valedictorian or the head cheerleader, a catholic schoolgirl or a foul-mouthed lian. It dosen't matter. Just wear the JC hoodie on the second date, and follow his gaze as he mentally undresses you. Let his eyes tell you all about his first crush, and it will be obvious how you should continue. 

2. Like the friendship bracelet, the JC hoodie is an excellent conversation starter: By talking about the friendship bracelet on the first date, and the JC hoodie on the second, you ensure that your date's gaze remains transfixed on some part of your body. Leave all the meaningful conversations about hopes, dreams and values to your friendzone. Remember: This is a date. Your favorite bible passage is 2 Samuel Chapter 13. 

3. Like the friendship bracelet, the JC Hoodie helps you to initiate physical contact. Recall that when you play with your friendship bracelet, the movement of your hands across the bracelet hint to your date how you want to touch him. When you play with your JC hoodie, the movement of the sleeves on the hoodie hint to your date how you want him to touch you. 

Hence, on your second date, start with the hoodie fully zipped up, but gradually unzip as the day progresses. Find an excuse under the hot singaporean sun to give your date the pleasure of taking it off. When sitting down for dinner, wrap the hoodie around your butt, your lap, your waist, your breast, your shoulders. Cover all your sensitive spots with the hoodie, or alternatively cover everything but your sensitive spots. Let both of your imaginations run wild.  

Above all, remember that the texture of the hoodie is different from the texture of normal clothes, which is different from the texture of lingerie, which is different from the texture of bare skin. Educate your date on the subtle differences between each of these. Let him learn to recognize each by touch. Let him learn your language of love. Let him be the first to say ""I love you"".

She invited me to her 18th Birthday party last year and I thought I could progress on to continue showing her that I like her, in some sense now I felt she was misleading me when she invited me to the party as we weren’t even established as friends.

she mentioned about messing around with other dudes in the club, because she found out that I liked her, and I was clueless for a while that she knew. 

Of course, I was very hurt. We also had a couple of arguments before graduation , such as she telling me I wasn’t mature enough to lead a group project, saying my attitude will kill me in the harsh working world etc. 

In the end, she was the one who was failing and I helped her a little for one module. 

She’s still stuck in the college while I’m working and enjoying my life as of now. 
I don’t know why, it sounds very cliche, but I feel she shaped me into being a better person and into a man, in some sense. 

I still think about her, even after 6 months after graduation. Since I have been feeling lonely due to the working world (where everyone I know now is busy), I keep on having this thought to invite her for drinks when I turn 18, hoping she would give me a chance, for her to see that I’m better than all the dudes that she dated (they all dump her and broke her heart allegedly) 

I do know she is single, and a lot of guys have dumped her, but I don’t know why I always saw something in her, which I myself am not exactly sure. 

What am I doing to myself ? Is it worth to even talk to her again ? Can I consider this person to be someone who actually helped me mature or is it just my loneliness talking ? Any advice ?

However for those who had lose theirs. Don't despair you can still keep yours till marriage.

Honestly speaking after married for so many years.. sex is not what kept the marriage going . In fact after children arrived, the only thing we desired is uninterrupted sleep.

I know it's the chemicals and not her saying these things, but it's still very weary and tiring...

What counts as a sugarbaby/sugardaddy relationship? I am currently dating a Singaporean NUS undergrad. Yes, I am older than her. And yes, we do have sex. However, I don't pay her any monthly allowance or contribute to her school fees. I think it is obvious that she should pay for those things herself. However, I do give her a supplementary card ($5k monthly limit) which she uses only for date-related expenses like food, transport, clothing and occasional holidays (which we both enjoy together). Just to set the record straight, she is financially responsible and sticks to the credit limit, although she did go slightly over the limit the past few months due to the school holidays.  

Surely this is not a sugar relationship right? Are girls expected to pay for dates nowadays? As a man, I feel obliged to give my GF a good life, to care for her and provide for her needs. I don't think it is right to cancel the card and expect her to pay for everything herself...

Then it screws up my priority for CS2100, and then I’m stuck with 16 MCs. At this rate, I can graduate in 2023 (or get booted out because I’ll take too long to graduate), and NUS gets an extra $10K. Well done.

When we were selecting our modules in the previous rounds, we could see the vacancy, popularity, and add reserve classes (in case we don't get the mods we want).

This time round when we are selecting tutorials, we can't seem to add reserve tutorials, nor see the popularity of certain tutorial slots? This makes it so difficult and confusing to operate ModReg, especially since some of my mods have tutorial slots with vacancies of 6, and not being able to see the popularity makes things so hard?

So to replicate the functionality of the ""add reserve tutorials"", am I supposed to just tick all the tutorial slots from the same timeslot and rank all of them?

It's actually quite frustrating that the UI is so unintuitive and the documentation is not helpful at all.

-Many people can potentially be your ""soul mate"" or ""the one""
-Even if you find ""the one"", a relationship won't just magically happen. You need put in effort
-Getting a girlfriend isn't the end. It is the beginning of a long term commitment.

Here is an analogy: A relationship isn't like Power Rangers where the Power Rangers gain instantaneous knowledge of how to use every weapon and Megazord the moment the Power Rangers acquire them. When things get tough, they conveniently get power-up. 

A relationship is more like Iron Man. In Iron Man 1, Tony Stark had to put in effort to master piloting his Iron Man suit. Even after building his first fully functional Iron Man suit, it wasn't the end. It was merely the first few in his series of Iron Man suits which he had to constantly upgrade.

3532,"TLDR; fated or not?

Last Monday at around noon, was at Novena Square2 Koufu foodcourt when I saw this cute girl around 160cm tall. Was starving so brushed it aside and went to buy lunch. My food was ready but couldn't find any empty seats except the table she was at, so asked her if she'd mind me joining. Good thing she didn't and I happily sat down diagonally opposite her (personal space right?) We were both minding our own business, but it felt like there's a spark when we exchanged glances. Wanted to strike up convo numerous times, but the shy me didn't muster enough courage for fear of embarrassment should she be attached. Sadly, she left while I was taking a call and missed the chance to get her number..

To that girl, if you see this post and feel the same, reply to this with a description of what happened so I know it's you and maybe we can hang out some time?

3542,"Imagine you are on a dinner date tonight. You have already chosen your outfit, done up your makeup and put on just a hint of baby powder as recommended in a recent NUSWhispers post. Are you ready yet? Not quite.

Go to your toys drawer and dig out the friendship bracelet that your bestie gave you way back in primary school and wear it. Don't worry, your bestie will forgive you for the terrible things that you will be doing with it in the next few hours :) Why, you ask? Three reasons:  


1. Friendship bracelets are sexy. 

Lets face it: Dates are awkward, especially during the ""twilight zone"" when your order has been taken and there is nothing to do but sit and wait for the food to arrive. There might be some light conversation at this stage, but no guy really cares about your favorite color or whether you are a dog person. Instead, I am 100% certain that the guy will be checking you out. All that separates men from boys is how well they are able to hide their gaze.

If you are lucky enough to be one of those ""genetically blessed"" girls, then this is the best time to flaunt it. In any case, it won't hurt your chances to play with the bracelet. Grope it. Caress it. Touch it.  Imagine that the ridges on the bracelet are the ridges on a guy's manhood, and show the guy that you know how to take care of it. Remember: to the untrained eye, all you are doing is playing with a bracelet, but in reality you are subconsciously signalling an intoxicating mix of innocence and sex appeal.  What you do NOT want to do is to sit straight with hands by the side like an Egyptian mummy, or hands on the table in the classic ""interviewer"" pose ... unless, of course, you are 100% certain that you guy is into that kind of kinky roleplay.   


2. Friendship bracelets are the perfect conversation starter. 

Once all the standard ""interview"" questions have been asked, you need to take the initiative to steer the conversation in a more intimate direction. I assume that by now, the typical guy has finished estimating your boob size and has started to notice the rest of your person-ality, i.e. the friendship bracelet that you keep playing with. 

Since you know you are being checked out anyway, I think it is a pity to diffuse the sexual tension by talking about boring topics like work. Instead, you can start talking about the friendship bracelet in order to organically start a conversation while keeping your guy's visual gaze fixed on your hands. For example, a conversation might go:

""Hey, I see that you noticed my friendship bracelet. Do you like it? My friend gave it to me during church camp...""

Then, depending on how your date responses, you can follow up with either

""Wow, it is so nice to meet a fellow christian!!! Yes, religion is important to me. My favorite christian values are chastity and honesty and my favorite christian verse is 2 Samuel chapter 13!!"" OR

""Want to hear about the naked pillow fights in the girls dorm during church camp?""

And so the ""deep conversation"" continues...

3. Friendship bracelets initiate skin contact. 

Since you have been playing with your friendship bracelet all day and talked about it incessantly throughout the night, it is mind-blowingly easy to initiate skin contact.

...
...
...

""Do you want to touch my bracelet?""

...
...
...

At this point, your hands are hopefully smooth and fragrant like a powdered baby butt.

Best of luck in your future dates :) Remember: If the date dosen't go well, you can just give the friendship bracelet to your date. He should get the message....

I (21F) was together with my boyfriend (should be 23 this year) for 4 years and its was his death anniversary 1 month ago. He died last year due to sleeping pills overdose. Yes, he had depression. He was a awesome listener and advisor (but sadly, not to himself), loyal, compassionate, caring, funny, etc, but one day, he started texted me a whole paragraph in an apologetic yet loving tone. And that was the day he died. I was devastated. His family was devasted, so were his friends. Although it has been a year, my heart aches whenever i think of it. He was my first and only boyfriend to date, but he died. I cried myself to sleep daily for about 3 months. Nope, i dont blame him for anything, he was an awesome boyfriend, but instead, blamed myself as i didnt notice anything weird and hence, unable to help him as he was struggling with school and sky high expectations from his parents. 

Up till this date, ive rejected 2 guys as im unable to open myself up, his death left a scar on me. So please, if you dont want to ruin or leave your boyfriend broken to pieces, dont ever suicide. Overcome your problems together. I know its sickening for people to always say seek professional help, but really, please do. If one doesnt suit you, try the next one. Dont be afraid nor give up. Be a warrior instead and im sure he will be proud of you. It is a blessing that he didnt give up on you. Fight this war together with him and both of you will turn out stronger.

I like modest girls and have only mostly dated girls who are the kind who save sex for after marriage and I'm fine with that. I don't think of them sexually or fantasize about having sex with them. The same problem happen with crushes, I do not have sexual attraction to the kind of girls that I develop crushes on.

However, I turn to porn and pictures and videos of girls in skimpy, slutty outfits that they wear to clubs and masturbate to them instead. When I see girls post images of them in revealing pictures of themselves in skimpy/slutty outfits on Instagram, I get turned on sexually but turned off emotionally. When I get to know a girl and find her Instagram, I will check if she posts those kind of pictures and if she does, I immediately lose interest in developing anything more than friendship. This also has to do with a bad past experience when I dated a girl that had those kind of pictures and I thought that ""she was special"" or ""this time its different"" but it turned out that I was thinking with my emotions and we ended up breaking up because of our different sexual beliefs and thoughts on modesty.

I do not want to date or have sex with just like that, they are just masturbation material to me. I wouldn't cheat on my girlfriend or wife but I will masturbate.

And god, does her smiles and her cute laughs make me weak in the knees. All I really want to do is just to take her out for dinner and get to know her better. But the problem lies in the fact that I have no idea if she's even interested in girls. That, and I don't know how I should go about befriending her in the first place when she seems so closed off from everyone else. To make matters complicated, we're both from different departments too. 

She was in charge of my orientation for the first couple of days, but our interactions so far have been limited to hi-byes at the break room and along the corridors. Maybe I should just give up on this crush after all. :\

And just today, while I passed by the pianos and tried to play, a family came to the other piano and the kids were slamming the keys with their hands. I tried to ignore them and continue playing and suddenly the boy came to me and slam the piano I was playing instead. Surprised at the child’s rude behaviour, I looked to the parents, and his mum was recording him slamming the piano I was at, like it’s going to be their childhood memories videos for them to look back on 20 years later. I asked the mother if she could ask her kid to go play the other piano (which her other kid daughter is destroying) and I got ignored, including the grandmother who was smiling and seemingly happy that they raised their kid to destroy public property. 

I get that whole “music is for everyone” kind thing but obviously some people are uncultured swines with demon spawns, whom definitely do not deserve to have access to expensive instruments or equipments of any sort placed in public. 

Does anyone know the contact of the people in charge of the piano? Is it by SRC committee or a club? Hope to write to them if they can maybe shift them to places where only students can access.

3562,"#67763 I am writing this because you said about seeking help for mental health and I want to help you if I can. I am undergoing treatment for severe depression (attempted suicide and got arrested by police and let off with a stern warning). So I would like to give my view on the 5 points bothering you:

1. I did seek help and they said that they will get back to me in 2 weeks time. (Great, totally useful with the fact that I almost had a full suicide attempt today.) 

--> Yes IMH is slow, if you need emergency help call SOS Samaritans of Singapore. Someone will listen to you but the trainers are on different shifts so the next time you call you need to explain your story again.

2. My parents is very traditional so mental health is not a thing. They always say ""why are you sad? You got things to be sad about meh?"" Or they will tell me stories of how much worser other people lives are which makes me feel even worse for feeling this way. So every time when I suggest that maybe I should find help, they will disagree and oppose the idea. 

--> A lot of people do not understand that depression is a real problem like a broken bone. Not entirely their fault because I find 80% of society is like that. Ignore them anyway and seek professional treatment.

3. I am terrified of the hospital. As much as people tries to sugar coat about IMH or whatsoever, I have heard countless personal recounts about how horrid it actually is. So, god, no... 

--> IMH is not that horrid actually. Maybe the social stigma makes you think that way..I suggest you change your mindset and be more open minded to seek treatment, for your own good. I used to go to IMH before but I switched to a private clinic because the appointments were too far apart and I needed more urgent help.

4. Medication side effects. Medication for mental health are extremely complicated and each individual requires different amount of dosage. Or, many medication just have side effects and they sometimes causes new symptoms to pop out. Personally, I hate medicine too so, double no no. 

--> Medication is not complicated. I am not a doctor and neither are you, so let us not assume stuff we don't know. You cannot be overly scared of medicine side effects which are rare and I am sure your psychiatrist will be qualified enough to get you through this. The effect of not getting treatment - has the potential to take your life through suicide - is much more dangerous than any side effect. Just trust the doctor. Personally, the meds have made me much better.

5. Costs. (I think this speaks for itself.)

--> Yes I totally agree with you on this. If you go to IMH it will be subsidised and quite affordable but the waiting time is too long. UHC docs are friendly but it didn't help me at all when i was in uni. So I go to a private clinic now. The cost is $400 per session with meds and the price is very steep for me because I lost my job because of depression and my current salary is low. But I still continue the treatment. Why? Because now I realise my life is more precious than a $3000 treatment fee. I am determined to come out of this disease and lead a happy life.

In secondary school I got close to this guy and we started texting a lot. We would text all night till late and continue in school (either teasing each other in real life or texting). We talked for hours about anything and everthing. He was so sweet to me . We were best friends but tbh we were close to crossing the boundaries between friendship and bgr. I really like him and I think he did too. But things got downhill.

Everyone started shipping us and things got awkward in real life. Whenever we talk or seen together in real life, friends around us would ship. It got so bad that even our teachers knew and people from different classes knew about it as well. Gradually, our texts also got lesser and we slowly drifted. We were still close but not as close anymore. After a year we stopped talking completely. My friends would tell me to move on, but I couldn't. I think it has been around 4 years since we talked, but I am still not over him. I heard he got a girlfriend now while I'm a single pringle all this while. 
Maybe you will say that was my own fault for not taking the initiative etc. I did, but we got so awkward because of all the shipping that we would be so cautious in talking to each other and became distant.

3567,"Recently I talked about the topic of virginity with one of my female friend (apparently a non virgin). A few concepts and keywords popped up that I want to implore more and dig deeper. The keywords and concepts are “opinion”, “personal preference”, “insults” and “judging”. 

Personally, I am a virgin guy and I don’t like non-virgin girls. It is a personal preference and opinion. I know others can have different opinion from me and it’s ok. 

Whenever people ask me whether I would date non virgin, I will say no and tell them it’s a personal preference. If the conversation ends here, everything will be great and nothing will happen. 

However, the problem comes when people don’t stop there (like my this female friend) and question further, usually asking “why don’t you like/date non virgin?” Of course, since I said I don’t date them, I need to explain about the reason for my preference. The genuine reasons are that I feel they are dirty, cheap, disgusting, low moral value, no self-love etc. 

They are my GENUINE reason and rationales for me. But whenever I explain myself in this way to justify my preference, people will say I’m offensive, insulting and judgy. And they will force me to change my personal opinion and preference.

My question is this, what rights do you have to brand my explanations as insults and start accusing me of being rude and sexist? They are just my personal opinions.

It’s akin to saying I prefer strawberry ice cream compared to chocolate because I feel the taste of strawberry is disgusting and repulsive. But others are forcing me to accept strawberry taste is not disgusting. If I’m not, then I’m narrow minded.

Why is she trying to enforce her worldview and opinion on me and keep on saying my personal reasons are flawed and stupid? Who is she to judge my preference?

Live and let live. Why must you impose your personal belief that non-virgins are the way to go and my explanations = insult when I’m merely stating my personal reasons and how I feel that allow me to justify my preference?

There’s is no absolute or objective right or wrong when it comes to preferences or opinion. Everything is subjective and people are entitled to their own preference and opinion. Respect other people’s view and stop imposing your own proclaimed “great non-virgin”. 

Instead of trying to justify and change other people’s preference, why not just find people who can put up with it and tolerate non virgin?

*Potential trigger warning*

Babe, I'm sorry for all the pain I've caused you since the beginning of our relationship. I sincerely appreciate how loving and doting you are towards me and I love you lots too. I notice every little tiny yet significant effort you've put in for me and from the bottom of my heart, thank you so much. There isn't any problem with our love. There's no doubt that we love each other so much but, in this love, it doesn't bring you happiness.
I know I sound cliché like, "" It's not you, it's me"" or ""You'll be much happier without me."" but that is what I truly feel right now. Yes, it's selfish for me. I know that in a relationship, we are a team. We need to work together to make this relationship work. However, before I can fight together with you for this relationship to work, I've my own battles to fight. I'm struggling and I'm losing the battle. I've expressed my agony fighting with my depression, eating disorder and anxiety to you and it breaks me to see you being affected as you hear me speak. I understand that mental health might be much too complicated of a topic for you and I don't expect you to help me solve the problem. I mean, even I can't find the solution even after battling it with it for about 5 years now. On top of my inner struggles, my parents are f**ked up too. I know you hate them for not responding to my cries and constantly venting their anger and frustrations on me. Babe, thank you. Thank you for being angry for me. It really mean a lot to me, honestly. It make me feel this warm fuzzy feeling in my heart because you're the first person in my life that ever cared for me. However, like I said, it hurts me to see you being affected by my problems. Yes, I know that we're a couple, it's only normal for me to sympathize and be affected when I see you suffering but no. I mean, since young, I've been constantly being 'abused' by my parents and it's a norm. But for you, it's not so you're not used to it. And now that I'm also struggling with mental illnesses, the burden you are probably feeling is 10times more than it already was. Although I am barely functioning, I can still fake a smile. But, it's a ticking time bomb. Suicidal thoughts is also a norm for me. So, attempts are always going to happen. Yes, it's stupid, I hear you. I am clearly aware of all the possible consequences I might face. I'm sorry but sometimes it's not about what I know, sometimes the urges are just way too loud. Babe, I know you don't understand why the hell I am doing this but, when I start to feel suicidal or depressed or when I know I'm relapsing, I start to push you away not because I don't love you. In fact, it's quite the opposite actually. I love you too much to see you get hurt. I know I say a lot of nasty things to you when that happens but that is because I don't want you to get caught up in the midst of the chaos. You've gone through enough already and you should just take a break. I'm a mess and I don't want you to see me like this. Maybe after the break you'll love me lesser....? So if I killed myself, you'll be able to move on much quicker and easier as compared to if you're still as madly in love with me like I am. (Ah yes, comments, I can hear people's knuckles cracking already) I know it's f**ked up for me to think like this but honestly does anyone relate? Is this something like a normal feeling someone else feel too or am I just an alien? Cheh, just kidding haha... 
Babe, sometimes I wonder if your life would be much happier if I died. Like, you no longer have to worry about me anymore. Like, this burden (me) will no longer be there. 
Sometimes I wonder if you'll be much happier if your girlfriend is a much more of a normal one. 
Maybe I sound like I don't love you, but I do. I love you so much. You're the first and last person I think about every day. When I at the edge of killing myself, simply thinking about you makes my heart ache so much. I hate that I love you so much that you can stop me. But I can't live on being like this anymore. I want to end this endless, torturous, bl**dy agonizing life but time and time again you stopped me. Why? I'm sorry if I sound ungrateful but it hurts. This is a living hell, stop letting me breathe...Stop loving me. Stop giving me a reason. (Okay, okay, I can hear people screaming through their screens already. Sorry people.)
Many of you may suggest seeking professional help but personally it is not an option for me. 
1. I did seek help and they said that they will get back to me in 2 weeks time. (Great, totally useful with the fact that I almost had a full suicide attempt today.)
2. My parents is very traditional so mental health is not a thing. They always say ""why are you sad? You got things to be sad about meh?"" Or they will tell me stories of how much worser other people lives are which makes me feel even worse for feeling this way. So every time when I suggest that maybe I should find help, they will disagree and oppose the idea.
3. I am terrified of the hospital. As much as people tries to sugar coat about IMH or whatsoever, I have heard countless personal recounts about how horrid it actually is. So, god, no...
4. Medication side effects. Medication for mental health are extremely complicated and each individual requires different amount of dosage. Or, many medication just have side effects and they sometimes causes new symptoms to pop out. Personally, I hate medicine too so, double no no.
5. Costs. (I think this speaks for itself.)

3572,"2 days before school starts. Pardon me for writing a long reflection.

Growing years. Tried very hard to try to gain acceptance from people around me. Went all ways, mild to extreme. Became toxic and soured relations..

NS, fresh start. found the friends and buddies where we could spend time together. Was great for someone who didn't have friends to hang out with and spent his off days at home alone. I was bad in BMT because of poor motor coordination and unable to catch instructions.

Uni, expected another fresh start and people. Overwhelmed by the difficulty of work and taking much more time to learn. Tried new things but was so bad in it, lost confidence, felt so ashamed by my failures (for what a normal person would've easily done) and gave up. I was so happy in the 3 months that I was able to do what I couldn't during semester, and when the break started I was so happy it was so long and I had much time to do what I had wanted. Meanwhile, I still live alone and loneliness overwhelms me when I see groups of friends together in school. When the break started I thought time would go so slowly and even stop.

Grateful: have food, shelter, education, and family has financial means for occasional luxury.

Ashamed: when family has high expectations of me but I seem to be letting them down. Dad overachieved in his life that makes it feel impossible I can even be half as good.

Fear: Maybe the single word to sum me up as a person. Slow. Not good enough in anything I do. More appropriately, bad in anything I want to do. Loss of my loved ones. Being alone

Stressed: being crap in everything and 'just can't do it'. Not living up to and probably might never up to my own and expectations of those who trusted me

Depressed: death of people around the world in the cruelest ways

I am lost. Struggling in the extreme ends of my inner world.

I fear stepping into school again. Lost in my direction in life, overwhelmed by loneliness even though I am used to it. I am disillusioned for thinking of things that never will happen.

Maybe it's not too bad if I don't wake up in my sleep, or I die in place of those who absolutely didn't deserve to in the tragedies.

3573,"Long post ahead.. I will try to shorten as much as possible.

Got tgt w very first bf, still less than 3mths. We're deeply in love and.. We're virgins. Been on the topic of sex rather frequently nowadays. Naturally, he wanna see a pic of me which turns him on.

Basically, I can take a pretty good picture because my deepest, darkest secret is that.. I have played online sex game and even PM with a number of guys before.. Or, quite experienced in sexting, for short.

So, those guys have seen pictures of me before (I shall not be explicit to what kind of pictures but.. It's for sexting so.. pretty obvious what pics I've sent and received before?) but has never seen my face or know anything personal about me at all.  Ever since I met my bf, I became less active and eventually uninstalled both that game and the chat app which I used to do sexting.

Clearly.. My bf does not know about this dark secret of mine.. So, i'm just really worried if my bf asks me how did I manage to grasp the angle for the picture.. Should I tell him about this secret of mine?

I fully understand that there is a high chance of losing him especially since his impression of me is that I'm extremely shy when talking about sex. Which I truly do, since I have never been intimate with a guy in real life before.

Now that I think back.. I truly regret my actions. I felt lonely since no guy ever likes me back.. Those sexting made me feel loved in an intimate way. 

I have no idea what a guy will think of if they hear such stuff from their gf.. Actually, i'm prepared to carry this dark secret with me to my grave. But as time passes.. I felt more n more guilty about hiding such a secret from him. Yet, i'm extremely scared to lose him because he might think how ""easy"" I am and that he isn't the first man to see my body.. Though, in real life, he will be the first.

So the question is.. Should I be honest with him about this dark secret of mine..? We all have a past of our own, but this is not an excuse for my actions.. I should just bury away this part of me, right? Not even my friends and families know about this side of me. Serious advise please......... Right now, i'm more inclined towards hiding this all the way even though we both said not to have any secrets between each other.. (heavy sigh)

When i first met this girl (21F) through a mutual friend last semester and she always gives off this cold vibe, which im strangely attracted to it. We've went out quite a few times with a group of friends and although she has a straight face all the time, she will be a good listening ear and only speak when needed, which is what i like about her too. We are in the same telegram group too, but she also doesnt reply often. Whenever i walk past her in school, she doesnt even say hi, or show any form of acknowledgement. I know this probably means she is uninterested in me, but i really cannot forget the smiles she rarely has, she is really a beauty.

Its been a month since ive met her and ive already made a decision to chase her but idk how. Any tips for chasing these kind of ladies?

3576,"Should I be dating or be in a relationship as a poor student? I am about to start y2, evergreen and this thought came up when I was thinking about my future.
Some background about myself: My parents are doing odd jobs and I have 2 younger siblings still in school. We live in a rental flat and living from paycheck to paycheck as my parents barely earn enough to support the whole family. My school fees are covered by bursary and bank loans and so my parents at least don't have to worry about this part. I do part time jobs and tuition to cover my daily necessary expenses and whatever little that's left goes to supporting my family expenses and siblings' education. My social life is already non-existent as I had avoided all the activities that cost money. There are a handful of girls I did consider asking them out. But I'm hesitant as I'll need to spend the moment you ask a girl out. Dating will involve meals and activities which will become an additional expense. I don't see the point of borrowing money from external sources just for dating when there are already so many pressing needs. Time is also a factor as I'm already squeezed between my studies and part time jobs. But i also worry about my future in the relationship/ settling down aspect as well. Feeling a bit lost here.
Anyone who is in a similar situation able to advise me? any useful advice is much appreciated.

3578,"I’m 22(M) and I’ve realised that guys really enjoy talking to me, much more so than girls.

To name some examples, my straight guy friends would always confide in me about their relationship and family issues, compliment me on my clothes,hair etc, gossip with me about who they dislike, ask never-ending questions on sports that i play and go shopping together. Even during my NS days it was always guys who kept texting me about my day in camp and how i’m adjusting so on and so forth.

I don’t dislike any of that at all but as someone who has an even ratio of guy to girl friends, it has always bummed me out why fewer girls like talking to me. I don’t particularly notice a difference in the way I treat my guy and girl friends (in terms of friendliness). And it’s not like 0 girls text me at all. 

Do girls think i’m gay? But then again gays would make good friends...Or maybe i just have some pheromone that attracts sausage parties

3580,"I'm someone who has been said to be ""easygoing and extroverted"" by quite a lot of people who have met me before in camps or classes. I make it a point to try to ease awkwardness by talking to everyone who seems lonely in the group, and I often joke about things in a light-hearted manner to get people to lighten up. I enjoy attention as well. People always say that I'm a nice and friendly guy, and I'm sure I don't make anyone uncomfortable. 

However, I keep facing a recurring problem. I am often excluded from cliques that form, even if I happen to hang out with that group of people for a while and have been socialising quite smoothly with them, as recently as the previous day. It seems that I'm always the last person on their minds when they jio to go out and eat/play, and it does sting to know they did not even bother to ask me. I did not voice it out to them as it only shows my desperation and insecurity (which is a turn-off I believe).

Why does this keep happening? Am I just someone who is fated to be alone?

3583,"To op of #67723, the post regarding you texting a girl for a few days and even went out on a date. Just want to provide a girl's perspective over here. The girl you described sounds alot like the situation i am also in right now (but not completely similar). For me, its not that i am not interested but personally, i am not into conversations that doesnt flow naturally, so i dont like to intently have to create topics while texting. So, i would suggest you trying to ask the girl out on another date (or a few more), get to know each other a little more and from there, the convo and texting will come more naturally (if she is interested). If she is not up for the dates, then she probably really is not interested.  To be honest, it's too early for me to tell if i am completely interested just from one date. Life is too short to keep trying to guess what the other party is thinking. Just take action now (but ofc not too agressively to come off as desperate). Good luck! :)

I still remember the first time we held hands: It was a weekend so tekong was empty, yet you were still so shy (that was the first time I ever saw you blush!!). After POP, one lucky break after another led me to be posted back to tekong, and I can truly say that that was the best time of my life: Two soulmates sharing their lives together in paradise away from all the stress of mainland Singapore. 

I would have gladly spent an eternity in tekong with you. Sadly, I knew from the beginning that continuing our relationship would have affected your career progression, and that your wife and kids on the mainland need a husband and father. After I ORD-ed, I decided to harden my heart and break off all contact with you. It was the bravest decision I ever had to make in my life. But then again, you were the one who taught me how to be brave. As time passed, I thought I had succeeded in burying myself in schoolwork to forget you, but seeing the soldiers marching past during the NDP parade brought all the wonderful memories rushing back.

I will always remember you: my sweet soldier, my hunky boi, my first love. I wish you all the best wherever you are, whatever you are doing right now.

I used to organize weekend camps for Sunday schools. Me being very passionate about making the camp exciting to these elementary kids, I resorted to building a haunted house experience for them, themed “the power of one”. Basically at least one person will go in and bring a key out to unlock lots of goodies (snacks etc) locked in a huge bag. Unlimited tries, max three per group. 

There was a run-down bungalow near the venue which the camp was held and I had carefully set up many stations of “scare” which would give the kids chills and make the goodies very rewarding. My friend was supposed to be the white “ghost” to appear behind the main door to shut the door and I was the “black” ghost that would appear behind a pail of murky water in which the kids must dip their hand and collect a key to unlock the goodies for the whole camp. 

Unexpectedly it was a big hit and all the kids had good fun screaming their head off (no nearby residential unit, we rented the whole campsite) and tell everyone how scary it was. 

I asked which ghost was scarier, the white or the black one. 

They replied and I could not gather enough courage to bring back the pail and other mockup items the next day from that dilapidated bungalow. 

The kids said: “the red ghost! It was foaming blood from mouth and looked so furious with red eyes!! Was really hard to ignore! We almost gave up!”

Happy Hungry ghost festival!

3595,"It makes me FURIOUS that many of my fellow babes don't know the secret weapon to attract guys.

I present to you: Johnson & Johnson Baby Powder. Dab some of it on yourself before going out. Use enough such that you can just barely smell the baby powder beneath whatever other products you may be using. Also consider carrying a small bottle of baby powder on your person so that you can apply more as necessary.  

Why is baby powder super effective? three reasons:

1. Baby powder smells good. Its scent is mild, neutral and inoffensive, complementing any feminine odors that you may produce. When accidents happen, baby powder is a girl's best friend. 

2. Baby powder is sexy. The scent of baby powder makes guys subconsciously think of babies, and all guys know how babies are made. Regardless of whether the your target is a horny schoolboy with an oedipus complex, a salaryman looking to start a family or a tiko uncle with an underage fetish, it is undeniable that baby powder has a mass appeal that is unrivaled by any other product. 

3. Baby powder has deniability. Things can get ugly if a girl smells another girl's perfume on her man. On the other hand, the smell of baby powder elicits a response of ""Wow, my man takes such good care of our kids. He is such a good husband and father"". 

Best of luck in the upcoming semester :) Just remember to use protection, otherwise the baby powder that you bought will end up being used for its original purpose.

One year in, I started developing feelings for her. I told myself I'll confess at the end of July 2018. Lo and behold, she got dumped recently in a relationship that lasted 8h, when the guy went back to his ex.

I postponed my confession, and decided to wait it out and be there for her. Till this year, she suddenly told me I was not her ""cai"", but still dateworthy

We went out for a few dates over the past few months, and just a month ago, she just dropped me altogether.

Looking back, I realise I was some kind of rebound. We frequently hung out in school , and especially so where her ex will appear and she will appear to be really enthusiastic with me, as if to spite her ex.

She also liked to complain about her ex to me. I thought it was normal since she was still hurt. Gradually, she initiated fewer and fewer conversations unless she needed someone to speak to, or she was bored, or had an anxiety attack. I begun to realise I was frequently left on read, being ghosted or outright ignored until she needed something out of me. I was stupid and continuously held on. 

I don't expect her to reciprocate romantic feelings. That would be unreasonable for me to demand of. 

What angered me was that, I was dropped altogether. When I pieces the puzzle pieces together, I realised that once she has recovered sufficiently, I was of no use to her. She gradually ""weaned"" herself off me. Bit by bit. And now it's the end. She doesn't initiate anymore. And I don't wish to disturb her peace. 

Hope you're happy C. And I hope it wasn't intentional.

Perhaps I'm too quick to judge, that I am only seeing us at our worst in these media-frenzied times.

Quan Jiang - I just dont know how to find ways to rebuild her self-esteem. Like now, other than depression, eating disorder have become another problem and she rather starve herself than eat because she thinks herself as fat. I really dont know if I am still the best person to accomplish this. Haix.
Zulkanaen Suriani - If I could jump, I would. But I think saving her life is more important.
Lh Sim - Well, her social worker and her team (psychologist, therapist, counsellor) did reach out to her parents. So this whole week, the parents have been really nice to her but now, hell break loose again.
Yeow An - Yeah you are right. She did feel like a burden to me. And I did let her figure out herself. Like one day she push me away, saying wanna separate but the next day she says she regret what she said and cant live without me.
Victor Lim - Thanks but I really dont know what to do now. It really makes me feel like shit.
Kelvin Bai - I did. Then she said do you really understand? I doubt so. Depression is not something anyone can understand.

So it seems like a trend that every Friday ,Saturday or Sunday, her depression starts to kick up. So like I met her today and everything was ok, like we were sharing biscuits and stuffs until when dinner time came, she suddenly start to feel guilty eating cuz she worries about being fat then she totally skipped dinner. Then after sending her back, she said this to me ""Whats more selfish? Asking a person who wants to die to live or lose a person to suicide?"" Her psychologist can only see her 2 weeks later with course of treatment, and she said within this span of 14 days, she is gonna pick a day to die. Was I wrong to stop her from dying last month? It makes me question myself if I did the right thing. Like should I really let her kill herself to end her misery? She said I was the reason the world is a better place to live in, but now she said she have her reasons to kill herself now.

I hope to lose half my body weight at the end of this journey. Please, no insensitive comments please. I really need to do this for myself and to prove to this boy who hurt me deeply that I should have been the choice. I’ve had previous experiences with fasting (juice fasting, water fasting) and will listen to my body and stop when it gets tough as I know the dangers that can happen too and how’s scary it can be.

3611,"Been with my bf for almost 8 years. 

Lately some things have happened in our relationship and I’m honestly tired of it. I haven’t really sort of told him how I feel entirely, just bits and pieces here and there. 

I realized that lately I’ve been finding faults in him even when it’s not his problem. I also realized that I don’t really show care as much as I did before. But if I feel that he doesn’t show care to me, I’d asked him why. Though some times I brushed it off cos I’m tired of dealing with it. 

The main problem was that because of his work problem, he hasn’t been landing a job that he can work for more than 6 months. And it’s been going on for 6 years. He’d work for a few months then goes out of job for more than half a year or even a year. We’ve been postponing our marriage plans, housing and travel plans. 

I’m honestly sick and tired of it. I guess I may have held onto these feelings and then it rubbed off in our daily interactions. I could really feel sometimes I want to care for him, sometimes I don’t. And I get super jealous of happy couples and couples who are already engaged and planning for marriage. 

I’ve a job that I’m really passionate about and been working for 2 years. Honestly, my savings is enough already to buy a flat and wedding. But I didn’t want it to just be my effort. It should be co-efforts. I don’t know what to do and feel in my relationship. I can feel that its a strain on me and I feel upset when I know I’m capable of treating him unfairly ????

Tl:dr; boyfriend’s attitude towards job is taking a toll on our relationship

3612,"Most of my friends in school don't know this, but my family life is quite messed up. 

My mum died when I was in Y1 (Freshie). Barely three months later, my dad re-married: My new stepmum is one of my JC seniors (same CCA). As you can imagine, the wedding ceremony was hilarious. At least the man had the decency to hold a private ceremony  so few outsiders know about his disgusting activities. 

Since my stepmum is one year older than me, she was still in Y4 while I was in Y1 (yay NS). Hence, we were supposed drive together to and fro from school. My stepmum knew that things were awkward between us, so she tried to bridge the gap by spending more time with me in the canteen/library/school events etc. There soon emerged a vicious cycle: the more she tried to reach out to me, the more I pulled away. The more I pulled away, the more she tried to reach out to me. Before long, she began spending so much time with me that I felt completely suffocated. I also broke up with my GF during that period when she saw my stepmum's personal items in the car. Everyone thought I was two-timing my ex with ""that Year 4 bitch"" and many bridges were burned in my social circle.

I thought my troubles were over when my stepmum finally graduated. I was wrong. My stepmum gave birth to a baby. I can't stand the baby's incessant crying, so I started spending more time in school to avoid coming home. I very rarely meet my family noawadays, and most of my ""family time"" consists of me babysitting while my parents go on overseas holidays.

I feel so miserable at home right now. It is national day weekend and everyone else is spending quality time with their families, but here I am babysitting again while my parents are on holiday in Greece. Family rumor is that my stepmum is pregnant again, and the man is obviously very happy about it. 

I wish that the weekend would be over ASAP so I have an excuse to avoid coming home again.

One night we met up for drinks. Our conversation   went from catching up, talks to lewd and sexual topic. I guess it's pretty normal to this talkss, exchange some tips, advices and etc. 

Finishing our drinks, she gotten tipsy and all. She is more relax, letting loose and opening herself up to me. While we are walking to the next destination, we got close with each other and she will like hug my arm, lean in, resting herself onto me, hugging and all. 

Important note is that, we didn't get intimate, at most is skinship, what I mentioned above. Even I did try to be intimacy with her, she avoids it yet skinship still carry on. 

We will teased each other during our walk. At one point she said: ""you just want to bring me back home"", because before, during our talks we implement and asking one another to do wild things. With all this happening, she didn't reject or push me away. I knw she is thinking about it, fighting herself mentally, in dilemma, like if she's s not attached. 

Before u keyboard warriors start complaining, we went home separately and nth happen. Not that I want to break up their R/S, but it's a thrill. 

If you were in my shoe that night, as a single like me, will you convince and take her home?  And since it didn't happen will you contact her and try again?

3615,"I fell for you a little while after we met. For a long time after that, I didn't really acknowledge those underlying feelings as you got attached and I just assumed that I admired you because you had the qualities I looked for in a partner. But somehow we still remained in contact as close friends for the next few years. You were my closest friend and I would tell you everything except for the fact that I liked you. However, one day, because of some things that happened, I told you how I felt and maybe that is how all the ambiguity started. I am sure you did not think it was relevant at that time then but you did not actually say things were impossible between us nor reject me. And so, we just went on as if things were as per normal. After you ended your r/s, I did everything in my power to be your support, to make sure that you were okay. 

As the weeks went by, the lines between us began to blur, I just became more and more confused as to whether we were starting to date or were we still just friends as we seemed to behave more like a couple but as we did, you would push me away as well. I understood that your breakup was still recent and you probably were not keen on another so soon. A few months passed, you kept pushing and pulling me and it started to take its toll on me. I considered giving up many times and nearly all my friends advised me to give up as well but I reasoned with myself that you were worth waiting for. One day after a particularly bad dinner, I asked you if we were even anything, and you said you were still not ready yet. I answered alright and told you that I was still waiting for you. And we continued on. The days after that seemed pretty happy between us but one day you suddenly started replying so much less. I spent my time constantly wondering what I did wrong as things were fine prior to this. You told me you had a heavy workload and could not reply as readily. Deep down, I was slightly annoyed because we both similar submissions to do and I could daresay that I had more things to complete than you did but I just said its alright. I did not ask you out as much as I thought you needed your time to do your work and if you wanted to see me then you would ask me out. But you didn’t. 

I realised that, for a long time, it was just me putting in the initiative. And one day I found out you were already going out with someone else. You told me that it was because I became very distant and that you guys had progressed really quickly in a matter of weeks. I was thoroughly distraught as I could not believe the years we have known each other could not hold a candle to the weeks you spent with another. You told me that we could still be close friends and I really thought about it for a while but in the end, I decided that you were truly not worth my time. Throughout our time together, you did not seem to put me as any priority in your life. There were many little things that made me feel like I was unimportant to you like when months prior we agreed to catch endgame together but when the movie came around, you told me you were already watching with someone else. I told you years ago that in my previous r/s, my ex started seeing someone before we had ended and because of that, I would give the next person my all. And I really did give you everything I could but I guess it was not enough for you. If you said that I was a close friend to you, then you would have known that I hated this kind of situation and being ignorant of this just further proves to me that you just did not care. You have shown me how it felt like to be used and discarded and reminded me why I cut people out of my life so easily. Now I just simply wish that our paths will never cross again but well, the things I want never really happens.

I was in the closet throughout my 4 years in nus, and because of that, I never went into a relationship while I was schooling. Instead, I was constantly wondering why god made me gay and not allowing me to experience romantic love like everyone else does. It was tough and at times, depressing because you simply don't know how the future will pan out for you and if you will be single af till you die. (And not to mention I was from eng so the work load really CAN kill you) 

Long story short, eventually I came to terms with my own identity, and came out to my parents after I graduated. Lucky for me, and they are very accepting of it (thank god for them). Fast forward a few more years later (along with many painful crash and burns and important lessons), I finally found my other half on a dating app and entered my first serious relationship at the age of 30.

For all of you singletons out there. Don't worry if he or she has not appeared. Work on yourself first. Get fit. Read more. Be nice to people. Groom yourself. Along the way you may get your heart broken many many many times, but don't give up and know that all these tiny episodes will make you stronger, and a much worthier person for the right one later.

3619,"Hi, I am not from NUS but would really like to share my alternative perspective regarding the recent discussion involving the dating scene here. Please, I am not here to criticise anyone but I have a slightly different experience which I find may be useful in this discussion. (Admin I would really appreciate it if you do not censor this post)

I am a Singaporean guy currently studying in UCL. So far, I have had dated girls from over 5 different nationalities thus far, and even got attached. The thing is, I don't identify myself as a good-looking individual- I rate myself as only slightly above average compared to my Singaporean peers, or even average.'I have to admit that the girls I've dated would be more 'attractive' than me.
 
The 'meaty part' is this. Before I went over, in 20 years I've NEVER had a single proper date with a Singaporean girl at all. Honestly, I can never dream of getting a date that I did here with a Singaporean girl of equal attractiveness, or even lower (I've tried and failed multiple times).

First, I do believe there is a good element of truth into the 'demand-supply' idea. I know the narrative that overseas girls are better looking than Singaporean girls is being criticised here, but from my experience I have to agree with this. I'd like to make it clear I'm not trying to shame the girls- the same case applies for GUYS as well. The guys are taller, darker and better looking- while the girls have better fashion sense and natural features. It's just genetics, nothing much us Singaporeans can do about it. From my experience, a girl that I've 'eye-candied' is almost always attached, if not there is a 'queue of guys' after her. I struggle to recall even a decent-looking Singaporean girl that would be 'easy to date', even if she miraculously is single it's like you have to compete with 10 other guys to ask her out.

So you might be wondering, how can a below-average looking guy in the UK get dates? That brings me to my second possible explanation- culture. I find students here to be much more open to be getting to know others, more open-minded and less judgmental in general. My girlfriend is much more 'attractive' than me- but the most important thing to her is that I treat her well. When I talk to my Singaporean friends, they tell me of how hard it is to get a girlfriend if you don't own a car. Literally almost everyone I know here does not own a car, material goods are a non-consideration when it comes to dating girls in my experience here (unless you're too poor to even go for dates I guess). Trust me, if you go 'I'll not date this guy/girl unless he has a car', trust me you'll sound like an absolute melt here- and I am a bit saddened that materialism seems to be a prime concern when it comes to dating in Singapore.

Third is probably the mindset. Perhaps given the wealth and abundance of options, girls tend to choose the 'best' or top 20% of guys to date- leaving guys like myself in the middle, without a girl. I'd like to make it clear I don't ask for the 'best looking'ones- I'm the sort that goes for 50% personality , 50% looks- but I found it hard even to get on with slightly above average Singaporean looking girls, because even those have options. I can't help it that there are certain girls I just can't find attractive and am unable to date.

I would appreciate further discussions on this post, but please, I do not mean to criticise or hurt others feelings. I do feel that the dating scene is indeed quite tough, for perhaps half of the Singaporean guys here- some parts of it may be our fault (some should up their game), but others due to circumstance.

3620,"Growing up my parents used to be the most generous and loving people I've known. Financially they have provided for me and for that I'm grateful. Now that i've started working for less than a month I feel that they've started to become really cold to me. They've been in a hurry to hand the bills over to me (which I do agree I should pay) but on top of that they have asked (almost demanding) a $1000 a month from me...

I don't make much at this stage and I can't afford that $1000 a month, it's almost half my monthly paycheck. The thing is my parents are well off in the first place and they are still making money (lots of it). I just don't know why given their circumstance they feel that it is rightful to burden me financially as such so early on. Worst is my brothers who make more than me contribute a lot less than a $1000 and it's certainly a smaller percentage of their income. Sometimes I feel that it's the people around my mum that is influencing her thinking. They make a lot of nasty comments about their own children and while she criticize that, she is starting to act and think like them unknowingly.

I have a gf and have plans to settle down in the future. Getting married is expensive and having a kid in the future only means I've got to start saving now. 

At this stage when my savings is low, how is it that I can afford everything? I pay for all the dates with my gf while I eat hawker/food court daily and not spend on myself at all. I'm considering driving grab for the additional monthly income but that is a huge undertaking on top of my day job. What should I do? How can I make my parents more understanding?

Yes I know the comments are going to talk about high demand for girls and Low supply of girls hence the high standards. Or like how girls have a lot more matches on tinder. Ok but what about in other countries? There isn’t really such high standards for guys and the dating scene is more ‘fair’, even though some girls overseas can be better than sg girls in almost every way. Feels like Sg girls just want a fully packaged men and enjoy our ATM while girls overseas look for love and willing to tough it out with guys.

3626,"I think that i am a slightly above average looking guy.

Throughout my life, i had been complimented many times about my good looks. Frankly speaking, i has always enjoy the attention from girls.

Fast forward i am now attached and started working. However, i still get such attention from girls even when i said i am attached. And ever since working it has gotten worse and is bothering me.

The girls at my office,colleagues, superiors and clients started adding me on facebook, getting my contacts by asking me or others and also asking me out. All these i can try to ignore and avoid.

However,some girls are making unnecessary contact which i do not know is it harassment.
Whenever, i tell them that i am uncomfortable, they will just say is their habit or simply calling me paranoid. Shortly after, they just do it again. And friends will just deemed it as me flexing or joking. it also doesnt help that i am rather mild-mannered and soft spoken.

Examples of contact made:
1) Colleague A will come to my desk area to smell my neck and hair from the back. She will say things like hmm smell great today i like it. (I have put a mirror just so i can see people coming) But sometimes, i didnt see her coming if i was too focus.
2) Colleague B likes to hug my arm while walking or on trains. Now i am more cautious about where i am positioned so that she dont have the chance to.
3) Colleague C likes to randomly takes pictures of me and post in whatsapp group. she also likes to drink from my bottle/cup to see what i am  drinking without even asking. This is less annoying compared to the rest.
4) My manager always like to touch me when talking. Like putting her chin on my shoulder and touching the fabric of my shirt. She also likes to make suggestive comments like the air con is cold today are you feeling aroused? Or hey you are sweating want me to help you take off your shirt etc. She only started to behave like this recently.

The list goes on and there are worse things that i feel are inappropriate to share. These instances occur over my temp jobs and my current job. As my section is mostly girls and only 3 guys. But i am usually the target of the teasing. It is hard for me to blast at them as it will be hard for me to work with them. And i get it too during my intern and temp jobs,so i am not sure if changing job will work. So i am not sure is it something wrong with me or i am too paranoid. 
Some of them just got so bad in the conversation that i had to find excuse of being unwell or saying i am busy.

It really disturbs me greatly and i am kinda stuck and lost. I told my gf about it and she is angry too that this is happening but feels as helpless as me. 

Please help me as i am feeling very stressful at work.=(

3627,"I had a relationship with a Malay guy, lasting for 5 years. He is 4 years older than me, knew him when I was 18. Before the relationship, he told me that it would be okay for me not converting if things get serious between us because he does have a cousin who married a Mongolian without having the wife to convert (civil marriage). His family would be okay with me. Therefore, we started the relationship.  

I am a free thinker so I was rather open to know about Islam during the relationship. 

So fast forward to the stage where we’re considering marriage as the next step, it became a concern when my family did not know anything about me and him.
I was very selfish to hide the relationship from my parents all the way.  Because it was really hard, knowing that a lot of things would possibly change within the family, I did not want to risk the peace of mind of my parents. 

Why? Because I noticed that he changed his mind. 
He started to drop hints, wanting me to convert after we got together for two years. I know it probably because he wanted to be serious with me, he gave me the reasons like our kids cannot keep his name as father name, I would go to the hell after death, his father would not approve our marriage, or I would teach the wrong things to his kids.  

I did seriously consider convert. The real deal-breaker is when he kept repeating that I have nothing to lose after converting because I am a free thinker, it should be easy. I was really saddened by this comment from him. He did not see things in my position at all. He did not know I might be ended up going home every day to have my parents asking me if I am sure about my relationship, or etc etc. 

Therefore, I had second thoughts. He was upset. In his eyes, I was just choosing Pork over him (he literally said that) despite me explain to him all my uncertainty and worries during that life-changing phase. I told him I needed his support and guidance on the decision and I wish he did, instead of being extremely defensive.

The relationship became ugly and unhealthy afterward, having both of us to challenge each other times to times. “Why you love me when I was not a Muslim, but insist to change me now?” “Why are you so religious when you are the one keep asking me for sex before marriage?” He even said that I did not give him my virginity as I did not see him as the one I would end up with. 

I have a close Muslim friend of mine once told me that I should never convert to Islam because of a man, it should be me myself want to. I remember going to the Islam Beginner course alone, which he didn’t even bother to accompany me there. When the instructor asked me where my partner is, that’s the moment that really strikes me. I am on my own, this is a decision for my own life, should not count on that man at all. 

It has been 2 years since I moved on from the relationship. After all, I thought I owe him an apology for hiding the relationship from my family for the whole five years, especially after reading the comments from the other post saying that there is no reason to hide a 5-year relationship. For me, it was not because of what but I felt that we were not sure where we heading, therefore I should not have my family being so worried about so many things unnecessarily. I am sorry. It was my selfish decision. 

Also, congrats on your wedding.

We initially spoke about meeting up next Monday but now that he ghosted me, should I still text him again and ask him if we are still on? My guy friend told me not to as guys rarely ghost girls on dating apps, hence it means that his interest level in me is insufficient to garner a meet up so I should move on.

3632,"I am together with my girlfriend, almost a year now. So she has this very good and long term friend, who has confessed he likes her before. Her past relationship was a long one and it was very serious. The friend was around when she broke up. Long story short, now she's with me, and it seems like they are still constantly texting, which is understandable since they are very good friends. But, this friend continues to gift her stuffs, ask her out, being very nice to her and it is still as if he's trying to woo her. And there I thought it is only a gentleman's manners that you don't go for girls who are attached or try to be funny. 

Any thoughts or advice?

3637,"I think my mom is mentally ill. I’m not sure when it all started but I believe my mom is a paranoid schizophrenic. For instance, when we take the lift together and somebody gets off before us, she’d think that they’ve heard things about her and that’s why they refuse to be in the same lift as her.

She works at a swimming pool as a cleaner and she believes everyone who enters the swimming pool mocks her behind her back. She genuinely thinks that people are out to get her. In addition, she also has random maniac episodes where she’d just start to cry or get extremely angry to the point where she’d threaten to kill me. (My Mom is not usually a violent person btw)

I think her conditioned is caused by her long term exposure to extreme stress. My father is an alcoholic and is very abusive. He does not have a steady income and my mom is putting my Brother and I through University with her meagre salary. We’re so strapped for cash to the extent that she does not even buy a drink for $1. I’m at a loss and her mental state is taking a toll on me. What should I do? Is it very unfilial of me to even suggest that she is mentally unstable? Please help me.

3639,"This is how an NUS student goes from being a open-minded individual, with a far-reaching outlook, to becoming a working adult whose life is..... just ""another working millenial"". NOTE: Does not apply to every Singapore or NUS graduate.

Our society has a huge focus on materialism, because we are a capitalist society, and our economy depends on it. However, it is the people at the top of the food chain, the crazy rich, who drive the material culture. Historically, exclusivity and luxury was only for the rich, because only they can afford it. But now that the middle class in SG have more disposable income, the rich create middle class luxury. So Singapore has a highly communal society. That is to say, we do everything in conscious or subconscious desire that our peers will accept us. Because rejection from our peers is painful. So when you mix community and material, what do you get? The chase for material in order to gain the approval of peers, justified as a form of morality. Not every working, middle class Singaporean behave as such. However, it is rampant. It is very easy to get caught up in such a culture, if the people around you participate in it. And after a few years, an NUS graduate can forget all about ""making the world a better place"", or ""making people's lives better"". This coupled with the pressure to settle down and have family, makes it even easier to morally justify the pursuit of material wealth. You need material so that your family can have a better life. And if you have to sacrifice your soul for it, is that noble? Therefore, the pursuit of material wealth, in the name of your family's well-being, is not only acceptable to your community. But it is also accetable to your self and your moral values. And your kids will learn this from you and become like you. Forget about ""making the world a better place"". Like seriously, Silicon Valley invented that mantra, but that place is really all about money as well.

Sometimes I also just laughed it off when he shared some memes I can't quite relate to. We both have different personalities and I have learnt to accept them, but it seems like he still can't. He would often want me to become more extroverted, but is being introverted a bad thing? He always has this misconception that being introverted is equal to not being able to hold conversation with someone, and thus is bad. He always compared me to himself, claiming that he is able to converse with a diverse groups of people. But I am the one who have more 'real' friends and who go for outings with different groups of friends more often. He would say that he wished for a gf who is more ""crazy"", less awkward, and ofc more kinky. I love him a lot, and trust me, I have tried to change whatever that I can to suit him, but I find it really hard to be completely someone that he wishes me to be. If some of my personalities are bad, I will definitely try to change them. But what he wishes for is not an improvement to my personality, but a drastic change in traits. Do you agree on this? We both love each other a lot and we are committed (we always try to solve our arguments no matter what). He would often said that he was just tired and he didn't mean what he said. I believe him, but the fact that this issue keeps coming up in our arguments shows that he still can't accept my personalities fully and it still bothers him at times. I would like to seek an advice here on how he could better accept the difference in our traits. (Please no breakup comment, it's not an option for us. An elderly couple once said, ""If something was broken, we would fix it. Not just throw it away."" And that's how they managed to stay together for 65 years. I believe that if you really love that person, you wouldn't use the excuse ""we are just too different"" as a reason for breakup.)

I realised he follows an overwhelming number of guys are gays (I inferred because they would hashtag  (lots of selfies) in their photos and they attended pinkdot). They are mostly of a different age so I didn’t think they were classmates or batchmates. 

He also went on a (seemingly) solo trip with a guy and took a photo of him topless. He also goes to gym frequently with a group of guys. 

I understand it could be selection bias and that majority of the unlocked accounts that he follows are gay. How many % do you think he is gay? And hence should i give up on this crush? Am I too stalkerish?

So now, I have to somehow hit level 2 on my own, retake and pass the placement test before I can study Korean in school.

I know level 1 is for absolute beginners but since I can't hit the standards of level 2 why am I not allowed to take level 1 just because I have prior knowledge that I put in effort to learn on my own? Why am I being ""punished"" for trying to study by myself? The only thing I regret now is learning on my own because now I can't take any module to learn the language in school.

3679,"I broke up with my ex-bf over the holiday break. The circumstances of the breakup are rather complicated, but that is not the point of this confession. 

The problem I am currently facing is this: Last semester, me and my ex did it in one of the lecture halls, a tutorial room, a staircase, between the bookshelves in one of the libraries, and some other locations around campus. At that time, I thought it was just harmless fun. It recently struck me that at least some of those places might have CCTVs installed. I am quite worried now. I really don't want the footage to be leaked and cause a scandal, especially since me and my ex are no longer together. Furthermore, my current bf is the conservative prudish type: I had to convince him that I was a virgin before he was willing to go steady with me. Even today, in our daily interactions, I put in the effort to mantain a ""guai schoolgirl"" persona. I really don't want all my efforts to go to waste through no fault of my own. 

Is it safe for me to do nothing and assume that no one will look through the CCTV footage, especially since it is already several months? Or should I take the initiative to approach NUS campus security to remove the CCTV footage? One problem is that it is realistically not possible to remove 100% of the CCTV footage. I don't remember all the dates and locations on campus that we did it in. Some of the locations are also awkward to describe in words, and may be covered by more than one CCTV. 

In the worst case scenario, if someone on NUS campus security looks through the footage, will anything bad happen? I assume that the answer is no: because 1) the footage will be very grainy, and girls all look alike without clothes on (I have no tattoos), so I can just deny that it is me. 2) CCTV footage has no audio, so they cant trace me from the sounds I make. 3) My current bf graduated from NUS some 10-15 years ago and is not internet-savvy, so even if some videos spread privately, it is unlikely to spread to him.

ARRGGH. Just typing this makes me so angry at myself. Am I just super unlucky or what. My ex dosent even drive a car, while my current bf drives a ferrari. If this incident really causes me to lose my current bf, I will be FURIOUS.
